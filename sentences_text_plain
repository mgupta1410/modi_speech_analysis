(lp0
S'my greetings to all my beloved fellow countrymen who have dedicated their lives protecting our great country india'
p1
aS'i have come out of delhi for the first time as a prime minister and have come directly to you'
p2
aS'i believe this will help you understand the priorities of the new government'
p3
aS'to ensure that our country supersedes the new heights set for development to ensure that the poorest of the poor live with happiness and peace and the single most important pre-condition is that india should be safe'
p4
aS'and for this safety the biggest driving force are the armed forces be it the army the navy or the air force'
p5
aS'it is the ability sacrifice and dedication of our soldiers that ensures a peaceful sleep to the 125 crore indians'
p6
aS'in todays scenario the armed forces have undergone sea change'
p7
aS'modern technology has become an important component in the field of security'
p8
aS'hence for a nation to be equipped with the most advanced defence technologies and armaments is as important as the pooling up of dedicated talented and courageous souls in its armed forces'
p9
aS'today is an important day in the history of indias security and through our navy that this golden chapter is being added to it'
p10
aS'vikramaditya is being dedicated to the soldiers of the navy'
p11
aS'a new and important step is getting imprinted in indias security'
p12
aS'the common man of the country would not be able to comprehend the importance of vikramaditya as this is not his domain but to those soldiers of the navy who have decided to dedicate their lives for the mother india very well know and understand the potential of vikramaditya'
p13
aS'it is a matter of great pride and happiness for me that i have the opportunity of being amongst you in this historical moment when vikramaditya is being inducted to the fleet to be able to understand its potential and strength and also to take pride in indias valour'
p14
aS'the navy has won accolades in many fields'
p15
aS'in the entire history of mankind shivaji was the first person to float the concept of a naval force and its basic association was less with war'
p16
aS'its main aim was to protect the ships going for international trade and it was shivajis dream that india should become a powerful country in world trade'
p17
aS'hence he thought of protecting the individuals involved in trade and with this the concept of a naval force came into existence centuries ago'
p18
aS'today naval forces have become very important for all those countries having long coastlines or who are close to the sea'
p19
aS'the competition in modern science and technology has also become equally important'
p20
aS'the navy has adopted the methodology of indigenous technology the scientists from our very own india in conjunction with the inputs from navy slowly developed indigenous technology and has entered in the field of strategic warfare and in the very near future we plan to take it forward'
p21
aS'we have to come out of the situation very soon when a country like india still imports defence equipments even after so many years of independence'
p22
aS'india has to move forward in the field of self-sufficiency in defence offset production and india should become a hub of such equipment for smaller nations of the world'
p23
aS'the smaller nations should have faith that they have reliable defence equipment made in india by the indian youth'
p24
aS'we should move forward with the dream that smaller nations should be inculcated the faith that they will never accept defeat'
p25
aS'the talent innovation research technological upgradation capabilities of the indian youth coupled with our strong deterrence will make us an unbeatable power and no one will dare to undermine us'
p26
aS'the safety of the nation is associated not only with the soldiers of all the three forces but also with the temperament of the people in power'
p27
aS'india neither wants to undermine any countrys sovereignty nor are we going to live with heads bowed down'
p28
aS'we may be a very strong nation but we do not intend to threaten anyone rather we wish to move together'
p29
aS'at the same time we are not ready to bow down and the indian government has the capability to see anyone in the eye and make its point'
p30
aS'and at the root cause of this courage is the preparation and courage of our soldiers and that gives us this strength'
p31
aS'today i had the chance to see this huge development meant for our defence forces'
p32
aS'for hours i have been looking at this ship from every angle - from top to bottom and from right to left'
p33
aS'i have been told that more than 1600 soldiers have been deployed on it simultaneously'
p34
aS'our air fleet will be able to take off and land from this ship'
p35
aS'this is an important development from strategic point of view and today we have received an important gift'
p36
aS'i offer my heartiest wishes to all the naval officers of the country'
p37
aS'the preparation required on the coast is much more than the readiness required in the sea'
p38
aS'training of the citizens there is equally important for the help of the navy'
p39
aS'a network of naval ncc needs to be created in the coastal areas'
p40
aS'through the medium of naval ncc patriotic youth force can emerge as a powerful tool which can provide the navy with critical information and help from behind the scenes and we want to work in this direction in the near future'
p41
aS'i would again like to give my good wishes to the soldiers of the army navy and air force on this pious occasion today'
p42
aS'this new government has made some important decisions'
p43
aS'for many years the soldiers have had a wish'
p44
aS'i do not know why that task was not undertaken by the previous governments'
p45
aS'may be it is my destined good fortune to do this good and holy task'
p46
aS'and so this government has decided to create a national level war memorial'
p47
aS'the future generations may be reminded of those who in the post independence era laid down their lives for the country which is why we have decided to take this step'
p48
aS'one rank one pension has been a long battle it has witnessed many ups and downs many promises were made but the intention was never evident'
p49
aS'this government just does not make promises it has the intention to implement it too'
p50
aS'we are committed to implement one rank one pension scheme'
p51
aS'i again dedicate the vikramaditya to the navy which has sun like brightness in its name that inspires to win many a wars ahead'
p52
aS'i wish that your life may be filled with the same brightness valor and the conviction to be always victorious'
p53
aS'join me in saying bharat mata ki jai'
p54
aS'bharat mata ki jai'
p55
aS'bharat mata ki jai'
p56
aS'the global economic environment remains uncertain and challenging'
p57
aS'recovery is still fragile despite improved prospects'
p58
aS'in an environment of political conflict and persisting weakness in major economies we have to be watchful for signs of a new bout of financial turmoil'
p59
aS'developments in iraq and the wider region could affect this'
p60
aS'i am also concerned that tight monetary policies in some countries couldundercut investment and growth in ours'
p61
aS'an open rule-based international trading regime is critical for global economic growth'
p62
aS'it must address the aspirations of the developing world'
p63
aS'it must also accommodate the special needs of the most vulnerable sections of our societies especially in areas such as food security'
p64
aS'this is our broad expectation from the negotiations in the doha round of wto'
p65
aS'excellencies the agreement towards setting up the brics new development bank is a significant step'
p66
aS'i am happy the initiative announced at the brics summit in new delhi in 2012 has become a reality'
p67
aS'the agreement on the brics contingent reserve arrangement is another major achievement'
p68
aS'i compliment our finance ministers for concluding these two initiatives so quickly'
p69
aS'these initiatives are rooted in our own experience as developing countries'
p70
aS'they show our capacity to set up global institutions'
p71
aS'they will open new avenues for supporting development in our countries as well as helping other developing nations'
p72
aS'we should ensure these institutions establish a new model for supporting growth and stability'
p73
aS'excellencies the theme of this summit is also the guiding principle of my government'
p74
aS'for us inclusion is a special challenge and responsibility given our vast social regional and economic diversity'
p75
aS'our policies will focus on empowering people with skills and opportunities'
p76
aS'we will invest heavily in infrastructure affordable housing healthcare education and clean energy'
p77
aS'we will harness all possibilities that advanced technologies open up'
p78
aS'all this will require fast-tracking of growth'
p79
aS'we will champion clean and frugal resource use to maintain the sustainabilityof our development process without constraining our growth'
p80
aS'sustainability has in fact been a core element of the indian way of life'
p81
aS'as mahatma gandhi had said the world has enough for everyones need but not for everyones greed'
p82
aS'we can all partake of the bounty of nature'
p83
aS'however exploitation of nature is a crime'
p84
aS'we have made progress on the millennium development goals'
p85
aS'but widespread poverty still haunts us'
p86
aS'we must keep poverty eradication at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda'
p87
aS'it is important to shape the global discourse on the same especially in forums like the un'
p88
aS'brics can be a major voice on the world stage to build consensus towards such efforts'
p89
aS'excellencies brics is in a position today where it wields enough horizontal influence to compel the world to take notice'
p90
aS'our own good however lies in deepening our bonds vertically'
p91
aS'we must focus on further decentralizing this powerful forum'
p92
aS'we must go beyond summit and leader-centric deliberations and champion sub-national level exchanges'
p93
aS'we must encourage engagement between our states cities and other local bodies'
p94
aS'brics should in fact be truly driven by people to people contact'
p95
aS'our youth in particular must take a lead in this'
p96
aS'popularizing our languages through dedicated brics language schoolsin all brics countries could be a beginning in this direction'
p97
aS'we could also consider establishing massive open online courses for making quality education accessible to all'
p98
aS'we could even explore the idea of a brics university'
p99
aS'today technology is a transformative toolin every area of social and economic development'
p100
aS'the vast pool of talent in brics could be combined to cooperate in areas like health education agriculture resource management and urban development'
p101
aS'perhaps a young scientists forum of brics countries could be explored'
p102
aS'other initiatives could include an affordable healthcare platform of brics nations'
p103
aS'mechanism to further cooperation between our small and medium enterprises'
p104
aS'and a common framework for promoting tourism among brics countries'
p105
aS'i am aware of the comprehensive proposals that our chinese and russian partners have put forward to deepen brics cooperation'
p106
aS'our sherpas should examine them urgently'
p107
aS'let us deepen our bonds to make brics a stronger instrument of progress for all mankind'
p108
aS'excellencies distinguished members of the business council ladies and gentlemen i believe economic forces are becoming increasingly important in global relationships'
p109
aS'domains like trade technology tourism talent and tradition have the power to redefine existing paradigms'
p110
aS'i am thus pleased that we established the brics business council in durban last year'
p111
aS'it is important that our business leaders lead the effort in promoting trade investment and manufacturing ties among our countries'
p112
aS'i appreciate the work done by the council'
p113
aS'various enabling agreements and mous have already been signed between brics development banks to promote intra-brics trade and investment'
p114
aS'i would suggest the business council work in close coordination with the development banks and the contact group on trade and investment issues'
p115
aS'the suggestions presented in the annual report are important'
p116
aS'the council should work closely with brics sherpas to see how these suggestions can be taken forward'
p117
aS'i am also happy to note that the council has gone beyond brics to make concrete proposals for contributing to the growth and development of the larger african region'
p118
aS'india remains committed to partnering with african countries in their developmental initiatives'
p119
aS'i once again express my appreciation for the good work that has been done'

aS'this increases the challenges of tackling poverty making growth more inclusive and evolving a sustainable model of development'
p131
aS'restoring a climate of peace and stability is an urgent global need'
p132
aS'this calls for newer avenues of cooperation and collaboration'
p133
aS'i believe brics can answer this call'
p134
aS'this i do because of the uniqueness of brics as an international institution'
p135
aS'for the first time it brings together a group of nations on the parameter of future potential rather than existing prosperity or shared identities'
p136
aS'the very idea of brics is thus forward-looking'
p137
aS'i therefore believe it can add fresh perspectives and mechanisms to existing international institutions'
p138
aS'thus we must ensure that the future development of our partnerships and institutions stays true to this original idea'
p139
aS'brics must provide a united and clear voice in shaping a peaceful balanced and stable world'
p140
aS'we should intensify our cooperation in confronting global challenges like terrorism cyber security and climate change'

p142
aS'this includes shaping the post-2015 development agenda to keep the central focus on tackling poverty'
p143
aS'we must seek urgent reforms of global institutions of governance like the un security council and international financial institutions'

p147
aS'it must also accommodate the special needs of the weak especially in areas such as food security'
p148
aS'excellencies brics has gained enough horizontal influence to compel the world to take notice'
p149
aS'our own greater good however lies more in deepening our bonds vertically'
p150
aS'this is why i have spoken on decentralizing this powerful forum in our earlier deliberations'

aS'we must champion sub-national level exchanges'
p153

p155
aS'our youth in particular must take a lead in this'
p156
aS'brics should explore developing innovative mechanisms of youth engagement'
p157
aS'a possible initiative could focus on nurturing innovation by establishing a brics young scientists forum'
p158

p159
aS'we could also consider establishing massive open online courses for making quality education accessible to all'
p160
aS'we could also explore setting up a brics university'
p161

aS'our 125 million brothers and sisters want to live a happy and peaceful life even poorest of the poor child should not sleep hungry at night and at least there should be one roof above their head with a proper access to education'
p274
aS'that is the reason i am saying that you all are not just for protection of border or for the protection of geographical structure'
p275
aS'your life in an indirect way is the guarantee of millions of life'
p276
aS'and until there is peace and security in the country development is impossible'
p277
aS'the preconditions of development are peace security brotherhood goodwill'
p278
aS'our army is an example of brotherhood - there is no distinction on the basis of language wealth and there is a feeling of being a family'
p279
aS'the term fauji soldier in itself seems like you are a very own part of the system which you can relate to and this honour does not come overnight'
p280
aS'these get developed under a certain tradition and this feeling comes when every moment this tradition is kept alive'
p281
aS'an army can not be made capable unless the systems behind it are well accomplished'
p282
aS'the term planning here is not restricted to the cantonment or the government but also towards his village and family which particularly need to be strengthened'
p283
aS'the soldier must have faith that even if he sacrifices his life for the country the country will take care of his family and leave any stone unturned for his familys well-being'
p284
aS'it is the responsibility of the country and government that the faith vested in it should not be shaken'
p285
aS'there should not be any question mark in the mind of the soldier posted on the border'
p286
aS'in the political field i used to work for an organization'
p287
aS'i came quite late in the world of electoral politics and governance'
p288
aS'i have utlilised my earlier life in mobilizing the cadres'
p289
aS'whenever i addressed my party workers i used to tell them because we live in an atmosphere of electoral politics party workers tend to seek ticket for election and if they are denied the same they ought to get frustrated due to it and feeling of even doing something incorrect creeps inside the mind'
p290
aS'this is a normal course of political field'
p291
aS'during training i used to tell my party workers a story which i want to share with you all'
p292
aS'i used to tell them that when an army soldier wants to take leave on the occasion of festival of raksha bandhan sister tying rakhi or a thread at the wrist of her brother for her protection'
p293
aS'he is normally sanctioned the leave at the last moment'
p294
aS'he somehow packs his round luggage and rushes for his home'
p295
aS'in order to reach the nearest railway station he takes whatever first mode of transport comes his way whether its truck or tempo'
p296
aS'due to last minute rush the passengers do not allow him to enter in a coach as he does not have reservation for travel'
p297
aS'you can image the similar scenario of fight everyday at jammu station'
p298
aS'the soldier does not get a place to sit as people here are used to soldiers on a daily basis so he stands for twenty four hours thirty hours sixty hours on the train without reservation to reach home'
p299
aS'if in some case he misses the train though he has left with the dream of getting rakhi tied by his sister but reaches home a day late'
p300
aS'in the interim before he reaches home due to delay his sister is waiting and the soldier travelling in the train has the image of his sister'
p301
aS'he can see the rakhi but can not not reach home on time and feels mental agony'
p302
aS'when he reaches home his mother daughter sister all are crying and upon tying of rakhi there is a sense of happiness'
p303
aS'mother is sick so he tries to extend his leave but leave is not approved so he comes back and resumes duty'
p304
aS'mother has to be operated he goes again'
p305
aS'for operation he wanders from the house of one doctor to other and the doctor demands money in advance'
p306
aS'he does not have so much of money with him'
p307
aS'at that time the he is annoyed'
p308
aS'can he not see i am a soldier serving my nation and here my mother is dying and he is not doing the operation for want of money'
p309
aS'child wants to go to school but the school is not giving him admission'
p310
aS'a soldier wants his child to get a good education even though he has studied in a simple school but the school wants ex amount of fee to admit the child'
p311
aS'he is very annoyed when he thinks about the doctor who has not treated his mother towards the school who denied admission to his child and towards the rail system which does not allow him to reach on time on the occasion of rakhi'
p312
aS'when he gets the news that his mother was not operated and she died so many negative things cross his mind'
p313
aS'if he analyzes the event one by one then he feels for whom should i lay my life'
p314
aS'should i die for the people who are not admitting my child to the school'
p315
aS'these are the people who were not performing the operation in hospital when my mother was dying why should i lay my life for them'
p316
aS'after seeing all this also just see the strength of the soldier see his temperament see his upbringing whenever the situation arises and the bugle rings he still puts the gun on his shoulder and says bharat maata ki jai hail mother india and marches ahead'
p317
aS'he never thinks what the doctor did to his mother what the teacher did to his child or whether he reached on time on the day of rakhi or not he chants the mantra of love live mother india and marches forward to the action scene'
p318
aS'this is not a small gesture this is not an usual thing'
p319
aS'i would tell my party workers that we must take inspiration from these soldiers'
p320
aS'these soldiers never get the respect and honour that they deserve but when it is required they serve their motherland india they put the gun on their shoulders chant bharat maata ki jai hail mother india and march ahead'
p321
aS'this temperament this strength is essential for the protection of dignity self-esteem and the pride of the nation and india takes pride in the fact that we have such an outstanding army'
p322
aS'whether it is navy land or air we have a chain of proud daredevil devout soldiers who are ready to sacrifice their lives and this brings a sense of pride in us'
p323
aS'whenever i come to meet them i get an inspiration to serve my country even more'
p324
aS'i have not come here to tell you all this i used to be amongst you all when i was the chief minister of gujarat as i used to visit the border to celebrate diwali there'
p325
aS'i went there not to tell anything to them but to get my battery of patriotism charged a little more because i know your life will provide us the inspiration'
p326
aS'army soldiers do not want to distance themselves from the society in general but want to have coordination with them and that gives strength'
p327
aS'had there been no coordination between the people of leh and ladakh and the army soldiers and had a tashi-nagia shepherd who herds cow and sheep not met an army officer then we would have not known of the kargil infiltration of the pakistan army for a long time'
p328
aS'due to the information received from a local shepherd who grazed cow buffalo and goat informed army soldiers awakening the nation about the impending war which we resultantly won'
p329
aS'in todays age the wars on the fought on the borders have almost stopped'
p330
aS'it is our misfortune that that our given our neighbours mentality of having lost the strength to fight a conventional war but the chain of killing innocent civilians continues unabated through the proxy war waged'
p331
aS'how many innocent people are being killed due to this'
p332
aS'these cowards have forced our soldiers to sacrifice their lives due to this proxy war than fighting the actual war'
p333
aS'the proxy war is not just a crisis in india but it has engulfed the whole world'
p334
aS'therefore as much there is a need for military power in the world the requirement of humanitarian forces to come together against this menace is important'
p335
aS'the more worlds humanitarian powers come together more they will be able to alienate the violent forces the humanitarian forces will defeat the violent forces'
p336
aS'we are dedicated to the protection of humanitarian thoughts humanitarian values humanitarian strengths and the civilized tradition'
p337
aS'and for this india is bound by its words duty and commitment and we want to move forward with this belief'
p338
aS'you might have seen the new budget the one rank one pension scheme showed our commitment and made you happy'
p339
aS'after independence the soldiers of our country were awaiting for the national war memorial to be constructed'
p340
aS'i promise you that it will be made and it will be made with lot of honour and pride and millions of people from india will take inspiration from it'
p341
aS'it is for those people who lived for us and died for us and this will continue to inspire us forever'
p342
aS'our armed forces should be modern and our armed forces should not lack any required resources and india should become self-reliant in the field of security'
p343
aS'i have taken a very big decision in the budget for it'
p344
aS'why cant we arrange to make everything within india than bringing them from outside our country'
p345
aS'in defence fdi should come new technology should come and the defence equipment should be made in india utilizing our current serving defence personnel that include engineers technical staff and skilled personnel'
p346
aS'we are working towards the deployment of retired defence personnel in the defence manufacturing system to utilize their strength on how to utilize the foreign funds and how to provide the best of best defence safeguard mechanism and we are moving towards it in a much planned way'
p347
aS'i once again through this brave soldier in whose name this building has been named convey my respect and tribute to all the martyrs'
p348
aS'i am proud of your duty skill and courage and as your leader i assure you that this country is for you and will always be proud of your sacrifice and timeless effort'
p349
aS'my best wishes to you all'
p350
aS'please speak after me long live mother india vande matram vande mataram vande mataram vande mataram vande mataram vande mataram'
p351
aS'his excellency president of india respected vice president respected speaker respected manmohan singh ji respected advani ji all present respected senior gentlemen brothers and sisters'
p352
aS'i heartily congratulate all the three great gentlemen who are being felicitated for their excellent work'
p353
aS'i am hopeful that this tradition being followed for the past few years will inspire all the parliamentarians'
p354
aS'each one will feel that in their respective roles as parliamentarians one should try and achieve high levels of conduct depth in speech and clarity in thought as maintained by these great senior members'
p355
aS'these kinds of thoughts would inspire all new members like us'
p356
aS'i agree that there are lot of intellectual talent in the house and i see people who are capable of presenting their word beautifully but the house can not run as an ornate articulation or as a remarkable art of presentation'
p357
aS'till there is a seamless integration of leadership duty and oration just the words will fail to make an impact on the house or inspire the nation'
p358
aS'and so those who won these awards today are the ones who have not only been good orators but are equally capable leaders and dutiful members'
p359
aS'the country expects a lot from the parliament of india'
p360
aS'we give the awards within the parliament but sometime there should be a public survey on how the public rates the house and in a very professional way the public opinion should be presented'
p361
aS'how does the common man view the entire house what does he feel maybe that may inspire us to think our way forward'
p362
aS'i would request the speaker to call the speakers of all vidhan sabhas if possible and start this tradition in the state assemblies too'
p363
aS'i think this will be a good step that we can take'
p364
aS'another thing i would like to point out is that when i was in the vidhan sabha and now for some time when i have been in parliament the humour and sarcasm which was an explicit feature is now missing something that we have heard and read so much about'
p365
aS'it has practically vanished from our party system'
p366
aS'one reason someone makes a remark then how will those who are on air 24 hours interpret it and will they debate this for 24 hours'
p367
aS'so the ones who can speak are scared and i think we need to seriously contemplate on this'
p368
aS'i have heard of old incidents of which i remember two or three episodes'
p369
aS'once there was a programme in the house to commemorate the 50 years of independence'
p370
aS'i had come to the house to hear it and some debate was going on and probably sharad pawar ji spoke first and then sushma ji spoke'
p371
aS'she joked and said i dont understand whether it is sharad pawar or lalita pawar'
p372
aS'the way i saw that scene the way sharad pawar enjoyed that jibe such a holy atmosphere prevailed'
p373
aS'and that remark was not blown out of proportion by anyone in the print media or the electronic media'
p374
aS'there is a casual sense of humour in our parliament'
p375
aS'and as our honourable speaker and arun jaitely ji mentioned sharp words can get you 24 hour footage but it can neither be effective nor inspirational'
p376
aS'that does not mean that everything should be done sweetly'
p377
aS'that is not what i am saying'
p378
aS'the need of the hour is to present the parliament in a way that it becomes inspirational for the future generations'
p379
aS'every sentence uttered in the parliament has its value that it should not be undignified'
p380
aS'and this is a collective responsibility'
p381
aS'this is our collective responsibility it is not about this political party that political party or about this or that specific individual but it is about our collective responsibility'
p382
aS'dr'
p383
aS'karan singh is a very experienced individual'
p384
aS'he is still bound by the cultural traditions'
p385
aS'whatever disappointments he has shared i am sure they will be helpful in self introspection'
p386
aS'for a distinguished person like him who for so many years has served the nation through this parliament to know his pain to understand his disappointment and then to modulate as per his hopes and expectations will usher in a new dignity in the house'
p387
aS'i congratulate these three dignitaries once again'
p388
aS'i am new to the parliament'
p389
aS'i also have to learn a lot'
p390
aS'there are so many senior members and by hearing them and understanding their views i too will gain something'
p391
aS'sharad ji said that once if he sits down to chat with the president he does not feel like getting up'
p392
aS'i am telling you the truth'
p393
aS'he gives such a lot of information with date and time and name it is surprising'
p394
aS'like sharad ji said he wonders what kind of software does the president has in his mind'
p395
aS'he said that what one would gain after reading an entire book more than that one would have acquire half of the knowledge about india can be understood by having a conversation with him'
p396
aS'every parliamentarian should have the intention to remember dates events analysis of the situation and an ability to grasp things'
p397
aS'all these can be learned from these seasoned members'
p398
aS'and it is true that clarity of the thought faith in conviction and correction in acts can help us take the dignity of the parliament to a new level'
p399
aS'i congratulate you once again'
p400
aS'thank you'
p401
aS'prime minister shri narendra modi addressed the nation from the ramparts of the red fort on the 68th independence day'
p402
aS'following is the english rendering of the prime ministers address on the occasion my dear countrymen today all indians in the country and also abroad are celebrating the festival of independence'
p403
aS'on this day of sacred festival of independence the prime servant of india extends greetings to all dear countrymen'
p404
aS'i am present amidst you not as the prime minister but as the prime servant'

p406
aS'today i pay my respect greetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the countrys independence'
p407
aS'i also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this country on the pious occasion of indias independence and recall all those martyrs who had laid down their lives in indias struggle for freedom'
p408
aS'the day of independence is a festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the welfare of mother india and also for the welfare of the poor oppressed dalits the exploited the backward people of our country'
p409
aS'my dear countrymen a national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild the national character'
p410
aS'this national festival inspires us to resolve ourselves to lead a life where our character gets refined further to dedicate ourselves to the nation and our every activity is linked to the interest of the nation and only then this festival of freedom can be a festival of inspiration to take india to newer heights'
p411
aS'my dear countrymen this nation has neither been built by political leaders nor by rulers nor by governments'
p412
aS'this nation has been built by our farmers our workers our mothers and sisters our youth'
p413
aS'the country has reached here today because of generation to generation rigours undertaken by our sages our saints our maestros our teachers our scientists and social workers'
p414
aS'these great people and these great generations who had worked for the country throughout their lives deserve our deepest respect'
p415
aS'this is the beauty of indias constitution this is its capability which has made it possible that today a boy from small town a poor family has got the opportunity to pay homage to the tri-colour of india at the ramparts of lal quila red fort'
p416
aS'this is the strength of indias democracy'
p417
aS'this is an invaluable legacy which we have inherited from our architects of the constitution'
p418
aS'i pay my respects to those architects of the constitution of india today'
p419
aS'brothers and sisters today if we have reached here after independence it is because of the contribution of all the prime ministers all the governments and even the governments of all the states'
p420
aS'i want to express my feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous governments and ex-prime ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day india to such heights and who have added to the countrys glory'
p421
aS'this country has been built on such foundation of ancient cultural heritage where we were told of only onemantra during vedic period which is indicative of our work culture which we have learnt we have memorized sangachchhdhvam samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam'
p422
aS'we walk together we move together we think together we resolve together and together we take this country forward'
p423
aS'having imbibed this basic mantra 125 crores of countrymen have taken the nation forward'
p424
aS'yesterday only the first parliamentary session of the new government had concluded'
p425
aS'today i can proudly say that the session of parliament reflects our thinking and it is a reflection of our intentions'
p426
aS'we are not for moving forward on the basis of majority we are not interested to move forward by virtue of majority'
p427
aS'we want to move ahead on the basis of strong consensus'
p428
aS'sangachhadhwam and therefore the nation has witnessed the entire session of parliament'
p429
aS'having taken all the parties and opposition along while working shoulder to shoulder we achieved an unprecedented success and the credit for this does not go to the prime minister alone the credit does not go to the people sitting in the government the credit for this goes to the opposition also the credit goes to all the leaders of opposition too and also all the members from opposition'
p430
aS'from the ramparts of red fort quite proudly i salute all the members of parliament i also salute all the political parties and by virtue of their strong support we could take some important decisions intended to take the nation forward and yesterday the session of parliament had concluded'
p431
aS'brothers and sisters i am an outsider for delhi i am not a native of delhi'
p432
aS'i have no idea about the administration and working of this place'
p433
aS'i have been quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last two months while being an outsider i had an insider view and i was astonished'
p434
aS'it is not a political platform rather it is a platform of a national policy and therefore my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective'
p435
aS'i have already said i salute all the ex-prime ministers and earlier governments who have brought the country thus far'
p436
aS'but i am going to say something else and it may not be seen from political point of view'
p437
aS'when i came to delhi and noticed an insider view i felt what it was and i was surprised to see it'
p438
aS'it seemed as if dozens of separate governments are running at the same time in one main government'
p439
aS'it appeared that everyone has its own fiefdom'
p440
aS'i could observe disunity and conflict among them'
p441
aS'one department is taking on the other department and taking on to the extent that two departments of the same government are fighting against each other by approaching supreme court'
p442
aS'this disunity this conflict among people of the same country'
p443
aS'how come we can take the country forward'
p444
aS'and that is why i have started making efforts for razing those walls i have started making efforts at making the government not an assembled entity but an organic unity an organic entity a harmonious whole- with one aim one mind one direction one energy'
p445
aS'lets resolve to steer the country to one destination'
p446
aS'we have it in us to move in that direction'
p447
aS'a few days back'
p448
aS''
p449
ag449
aS'nowadays newspapers are full of news that modijis government has come officers are reaching office on time offices open in time and people get there in time'
p450
aS'i observed that indias national newspapers tv media were carrying these news items prominently'
p451
aS'as the head of the government i could have derived pleasure in the fact that everything started going on time cleanliness got the attention but i was not taking pleasure i was feeling pained'
p452
aS'that thing i want to tell today in public'
p453
aS'and why because if government officers arrive office in time does that make a news'
p454
aS'and if that makes news it shows how low we have fallen'
p455
aS'it becomes a proof of that and thats how brothers and sisters the governments have run'
p456
aS'today in the face of global competition when we have to realize the dreams of millions of indians the country can not run on the lines of it happens it goes'
p457
aS'in order to fulfil the aspirations of masses we have to sharpen the tool called the government machinery we have to make it keen more dynamic and it is in this direction that we are working'
p458
aS'my countrymen its not long since i have come from outside delhi but i give you an assurance that the people in the government are very capable - from the peon to the cabinet secretary everybody is capable everybody has a power they have experience'
p459
aS'i want to awaken that power i want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the welfare of nation through that power and i shall definitely do it'
p460
aS'i want to assure the countrymen that we will achieve that we will definitely do that'
p461
aS'i could not say this on 16th may but today after my experience of two-two and half months keeping the tricolor as witness i am saying on 15th of august that it is possible it will be achieved'
p462
aS'brothers and sisters time has come to give a serious thought to the fact that whether we have a duty to create india of the dreams of those great people who gave us freedom whether we have a national character'
p463
aS'brothers and sisters can someone please tell me as to whether he or she has ever introspected in the evening after a full days work as to whether his or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not whether his or her actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not whether the actions have been directed in countrys welfare or not'
p464
aS'whether it should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen that every step in life should be in the countrys interests'
p465
aS'unfortunately we have an environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some work he begins by saying what does it mean for me'
p466
aS'he begins by saying what does it involve for me'
p467
aS'and when he come to know that it does not entail any benefit for him immediately he says why should i bother'
p468
aS'we have to rise above the feelings of what does it mean for me and why should i bother'
p469
aS'everything is not for self interest only'
p470
aS'there are certain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine this national character'
p471
aS'we have to rise above the feelings of why should i bother and what does it mean for me and instead we have to think that i am for nations interest and in this field i am going to lead'
p472
aS'we have to inculcate this sentiment'
p473
aS'brothers and sisters when we hear about the incidents of rape we hang our heads in shame'
p474
aS'people come out with different arguments someone indulges in psycho analysis but brothers and sisters today from this platform i want to ask those parents i want to ask every parent that you have a daughter of 10 or 12 years age you are always on the alert every now and then you keep on asking where are you going when would you come back inform immediately after you reach'
p475
aS'parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions but have any parents ever dared to ask their son as to where he is going why he is going out who his friends are'
p476
aS'after all a rapist is also somebodys son'
p477
aS'he also has parents'
p478
aS'as parents have we ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going'
p479
aS'if every parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have been imposed on our daughters try to do this with your sons try to ask such questions of them'
p480
aS'my dear brothers and sisters the law will take its own course strict action will be taken but as a member of the society as parents we also have some responsibilities'
p481
aS'if somebody tells me that those who have taken guns on their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists are terrorists but they are also somebodys children'
p482
aS'i would like to ask of such parents if they had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path'
p483
aS'every parent must take this responsibility he must know that his misguided son is bent on killing innocent people'
p484
aS'he is not able to serve himself nor his family nor the country'
p485
aS'i want to say to those youngsters who have chosen the path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are it is all because of mother india only that they have got it'
p486
aS'whoever you are it is all because of your parents'
p487
aS'i want to ask you to think how green how beautiful and how beneficial this earth can become if you shoulder the plough instead of the gun which spills blood on this land'
p488
aS'how long shall we have bloodshed on this land how long shall we take the lives of the innocent people and what have we got after all this'
p489
aS'the path of violence has not yielded anything to us'
p490
aS'brothers and sisters i had gone to nepal recently'
p491
aS'there i said something publicly to draw the attention of the whole world'
p492
aS'there was a time when the emperor ashoka who had chosen the path of wars got converted to the path of buddha at the sight of violence'
p493
aS'there was a time in nepal when their youngsters had opted for the path of violence but today i witness that the same youngsters are waiting for their constitution'
p494
aS'the same people associated with them are framing the constitution'
p495
aS'and i further said that if nepal could present the best example of moving from the weapons to the books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in the world to abandon the path of violence'
p496
aS'brothers and sisters if nepal land of budha can give message to the world then why cant india too do the same'
p497
aS'so its the call of the hour that we renounce the path of violence and take the path of brotherhood'
p498
aS'brothers and sisters for one reason or the other we have had communal tensions for ages'
p499
aS'this led to the division of the country'
p500
aS'even after independence we have had to face the poison of casteism and communalism'
p501
aS'how long these evils will continue'
p502
aS'whom does it benefit'
p503
aS'we have had enough of fights many have been killed'
p504
aS'friends look behind and you will find that nobody has benefited from it'
p505
aS'except casting a slur on mother india we have done nothing'
p506
aS'therefore i appeal to all those people that whether it is the poison of casteism communalism regionalism discrimination on social and economic basis all these are obstacles in our way forward'
p507
aS'lets resolve for once in our hearts lets put a moratorium on all such activities for ten years we shall march ahead to a society which will be free from all such tensions'

aS'with advancement of science brothers and sisters we have a rising feeling of modernity in our mind but what do we do'
p514
aS'have we ever thought what the sex ratio in the country is like'
p515
aS'940 girls are born against per thousand boys'
p516
aS'who is causing this imbalance in the society'
p517
aS'certainly not god'
p518
aS'i request the doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just to line their own pockets'
p519
aS'i advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice daughters in the hope of son'
p520
aS'sometimes mother-father feel tempted to have son in the hope of supporting them in old age'
p521
aS'i am a person who has worked in public life'
p522
aS'i have come across families with five sons each having bungalows access to fleet of cars but parents are forced to live in old-age homes vriddhashrams'
p523
aS'i have seen such families'
p524
aS'i have also seen families with only daughter as progeny that daughter sacrifices her dreams doesnt get married and spends entire life in taking care of old parents'
p525
aS'this disparity points to female foeticide and the polluted and tainted mind the 21st century has'
p526
aS'we will have to liberate from it and that is message to us of this freedom festival'
p527
aS'recently commonwealth games were organized'
p528
aS'indian sportspersons brought glory to the country'
p529

aS'lets recognise it'
p535
aS'lets take them along shoulder to shoulder'
p536
aS'this way we can get over the evils that have crept in social life'
p537
aS'therefore brothers and sisters we have to proceed in that direction as a social and national character'
p538
aS'brothers and sisters development is the only way forward for the country'
p539
aS'good governance is the only way'
p540
aS'there are only these two tracks to take the country forward - good governance and development we can move forward only by taking them with us'
p541
aS'we wish to move forward with the intent of taking them with us'
p542
aS'when i talk of good governance you tell me when i ask a person in private job he tells that he does the job when you ask the same from a person in government job he says that i do the service'
p543
aS'both earn but for one it is job while for the other it is service'
p544
aS'i ask a question from all brothers and sisters in government service whether the word service has not lost its strength its identity'
p545
aS'persons in government service are not doing job they are doing service'
p546
aS'we have to revive this feeling we have to take this feeling forward as a national character we have to move forward in this direction'
p547
aS'brothers and sisters whether the citizens of the country should take steps for the welfare of the nation or not'
p548
aS'you imagine if this 125 crores of countrymen move one step forward then the country moves 125 crore steps forward'
p549
aS'the meaning of democracy is not just limited to electing a government but its meaning is that 125 crore of citizens work together joining shoulder with the government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the country this is the meaning of democracy'
p550
aS'we have to create partnership with the people'
p551
aS'we have to proceed under public-private partnership'
p552
aS'we have to proceed along with the participation of the people'
p553
aS'but please tell me why our farmers commit suicide'
p554
aS'a farmer takes loan from the moneylender but fails to repay his loans'
p555
aS'he takes loan for the wedding of his daughter but fails to repay'
p556
aS'he will have to suffer hardships during his whole life'
p557
aS'he chooses to commit suicide'
p558
aS'who will save the poor families of such farmers'
p559
aS'brothers and sisters i have come here with a pledge to launch a scheme on this festival of freedom'
p560
aS'it will be calledpradhanmantri jan-dhan yojana'
p561
aS'i wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country with the facility of bank accounts through this yojana'
p562
aS'there are millions of families who have mobile phones but no bank accounts'
p563
aS'we have to change this scenario'
p564
aS'economic resources of the country should be utilized for the well-being of the poor'
p565
aS'the change will commence from this point'
p566
aS'this yojana will open the window'

p569
aS'my brothers and sisters it is a country of young people'
p570
aS'the 65 percent population of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years'
p571
aS'our country has the largest number of youths in the world'
p572
aS'have we ever thought of deriving an advantage out of it'
p573
aS'today the world needs a skilled workforce'
p574
aS'today india also needs a skilled workforce'
p575
aS'at times we look for a good driver but he is not available we look for a plumber but he is not available'
p576
aS'if we need a good cook he is not available'
p577
aS'we have young people they are unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are not available'
p578
aS'if we have to promote the development of our country then our mission has to be skill development and skilled india'
p579
aS'millions and millions of indian youth should go for acquisition of skills and there should be a network across the country for this and not the archaic systems'
p580
aS'they should acquire the skills which could contribute towards making india a modern country'
p581
aS'whenever they go to any country in the world their skills must be appreciated and we want to go for a two pronged development'
p582
aS'i also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs and the ones who are not capable of creating jobs and do not have the opportunities they must be in a position to face their counterparts in any corner of the world while keeping their heads high by virtue of their hard work and their dexterity of hands and win the hearts of people around the world through their skills'
p583
aS'we want to go for the capacity building of such young people'
p584
aS'my brothers and sisters having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace i want to accomplish this'
p585
aS'brothers and sisters the world has undergone a change'
p586
aS'my dear countrymen the world has changed'
p587
aS'now india can not decide its future by remaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner'
p588
aS'the economics of the world have changed and therefore we will have to act accordingly'
p589
aS'government have taken many decisions recently made some announcements in the budget and i call upon the world and call upon the indians spread world over that if we have to provide more and more employment to the youth we will have to promote manufacturing sector'
p590
aS'if we have to develop a balance between imports and exports we will have to strengthen manufacturing sector'
p591
aS'if we have to put in use the education the capability of the youth we will have to go for manufacturing sector and for this hindustan also will have to lend its full strength but we also invite world powers'
p592
aS'therefore i want to appeal all the people world over from the ramparts of the red fort come make in india come manufacture in india'
p593
aS'sell in any country of the world but manufacture here'
p594
aS'we have got skill talent discipline and determination to do something'
p595
aS'we want to give the world an favourable opportunity that come here come make in india and we will say to the world from electrical to electronics come make in india from automobiles to agro value addition come make in india paper or plastic come make in india satellite or submarine come make in india'
p596
aS'our country is powerful'
p597
aS'come i am giving you an invitation'
p598
aS'brothers and sisters i want to call upon the youth of the country particularly the small people engaged in the industrial sector'
p599
aS'i want to call upon the youth working in the field of technical education in the country'
p600
aS'as i say to the world come make in india i say to the youth of the country - it should be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the world made in india'
p601
aS'this should be our dream'
p602
aS'whether to serve the country is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like bhagat singh'
p603
aS'brothers and sisters lal bahadur shastri had given the slogan jai jawan jai kisan'
p604
aS'a soldier sacrifices himself at the border and protects mother india'
p605
aS'similarly a farmer serves mother india by filling the godowns with grains'
p606
aS'this is also nations service'
p607
aS'filling the granary is the biggest nations service that a farmer provides'
p608
aS'that is why lal bahadur shashtri had given the slogan of jai jawan jai kisan'
p609
aS'brothers and sisters i would like to pose a question to my youngsters as to why despite them we are forced to import even the smallest of things'
p610
aS'my countrys youth can resolve it they should conduct research try to find out as to what type of items are imported by india and then each one should resolve that through may be micro or small industries only he would manufacture atleast one such item so that we need not import the same in future'
p611
aS'we should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to export such items'
p612
aS'if each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture atleast one such item india can become a net exporter of goods'
p613
aS'i therefore urge upon the youth in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would never compromise atleast on two counts'
p614
aS'first zero defect and second again zero effect'
p615
aS'we should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero defect that our exported goods are never returned to us'
p616
aS'we should manufacture goods with zero effect that they should not have a negative impact on the environment'
p617
aS'if we march ahead with the dream of zero defect in the manufacturing sector then my brothers and sisters i am confident that we would be able to achieve our goals'
p618
aS'brothers and sisters the youth of india has completely transformed the identity of india in the world'
p619
aS'earlier in what manner did the world know our country'
p620
aS'till only 25-30 years back if not more there were many people in the world who thought that india was a country of snake charmers it was a country which practiced in black magic'
p621
aS'the real identity of india had not reached the world but my dear brothers and sisters our youngsters 20-22-23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with their skills in computers'
p622
aS'our young i'
p623
aS't'
p624
aS'professionals have given a new path of making a new identity of india'
p625
aS'if our country has this strength can we think something about the country'
p626
aS'our dream is therefore of digital india'
p627
aS'when i talk of digital india i dont speak of the elite it is for the poor people'
p628
aS'you can imagine what a quality education the children in villages will get if all the villages of india are connected with broadband connectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the schools in every remote corner of the villages'
p629
aS'if we create a network of telemedicine in the places where there is a shortage of doctors we can have a clear guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be provided to the poor people living in those areas'
p630
aS'the citizens of india have mobile phones in their hands they have mobile connectivity but can we walk in the direction of mobile governance'
p631
aS'we have to move in a direction where every poor person is able to operate his bank account from his mobile is able to demand various things from the government can submit applications can conduct all his business while on the move through mobile governance and if this has to be done we have to move towards digital india and if we have to move towards digital india then we have a dream'
p632
aS'today we are importing electronic goods on a large scale'
p633
aS'friends you will be surprised that we are bringing in these televisions mobile phones i-pads and all these electronic goods'
p634
aS'it is a necessity to import petroleum products oil diesel and petrol'
p635
aS'second to this is the import of our electronic goods'
p636
aS'if we move ahead with the dream of digital india to manufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at least there how big can be the benefit for the treasury'
p637
aS'therefore e-governance is what we need to take this idea of digital india forward'
p638
aS'e-governance is easy governance effective governance and also economic governance'
p639
aS'e-governance paves the way for good governance'
p640
aS'there was a time when we used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country'
p641
aS'that was it'
p642
aS'i say that today it is it that has the potential to connect each and every citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra of unity with the help of digital india'
p643
aS'brothers and sisters if we move ahead with all this then i believe that a digital india will have the potential to stand with the world on equal footing'
p644
aS'our youth have that capability it is an opportunity for them'
p645
aS'brothers and sisters we want to promote tourism'
p646
aS'tourism provides employment to the poorest of the poor'
p647
aS'gram seller earns something auto-rickshaw driver earns something pakoda seller earns something and tea seller also earns something'
p648
aS'when there is talk of tea seller i feel a sense of belongingness'
p649
aS'tourism provide employment to the poorest of the poor'
p650
aS'but there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national character and that is - the filthiness all around us'
p651
aS'whether after independence after so many years of independence when we stand at the threshold of one and half decade of 21st century we still want to live in filthiness'
p652
aS'the first work i started here after formation of government is of cleanliness'
p653
aS'people wondered whether it is a work of a prime minister'
p654
aS'people may feel that it is a trivial work for a prime minister but for me this a big work'
p655
aS'cleanliness is very big work'
p656
aS'whether our country can not be clean'
p657
aS'if one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen decide that they will never spread filthiness which power in the world has ability to spread filthiness in our cities and villages'
p658
aS'cant we resolve this much'
p659
aS'brothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi in 2019'
p660
aS'how do we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi'
p661
aS'mahatma gandhi who gave us freedom who brought so much honour to such a big country in the world what do we give to mahatma gandhi'
p662
aS'brothers and sisters mahatma gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation closest to his heart'
p663
aS'whether we resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our village city street area school temple hospital and what have you by 2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi'
p664
aS'this happens not just with the government but with public participation'
p665
aS'thats why we have to do it together'
p666
aS'brother and sisters we are living in 21st century'
p667
aS'has it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open'
p668
aS'whether dignity of women is not our collective responsibility'
p669
aS'the poor womenfolk of the village wait for the night until darkness descends they cant go out to defecate'
p670
aS'what bodily torture they must be feeling how many diseases that act might engender'
p671
aS'cant we just make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and sisters'
p672
aS'brothers and sisters somebody might feel that a big festival like 15th august is an occasion to talk big'
p673
aS'brothers and sisters talking big has its importance making announcements too has importance but sometimes announcements raise hopes and when the hopes are not fulfilled the society sinks into a state of despondency'
p674
aS'thats why are in favour of telling those things which we can fulfil just within our sight'
p675
aS'brothers and sisters you must be getting shocked to hear the prime minister speaking of cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the ramparts of the red fort'
p676
aS'brothers and sisters i do not know how my speech is going to be criticised and how will people take it'
p677
aS'but this is my heartfelt conviction'
p678
aS'i come from a poor family i have seen poverty'
p679
aS'the poor need respect and it begins with cleanliness'
p680
aS'i therefore have to launch a clean india campaign from 2nd october this year and carry it forward in 4 years'
p681
aS'i want to make a beginning today itself and that is - all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls'
p682
aS'only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway'
p683
aS'our parliamentarians utilizing mplad fund are there'
p684
aS'i appeal to them to spend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year'
p685
aS'the government should utilise its budget on providing toilets'
p686
aS'i call upon the corporate sector also to give priority to the provision of toilets in schools with your expenditure under corporate social responsibility'
p687
aS'this target should be finished within one year with the help of state governments and on the next 15th august we should be in a firm position to announce that there is no school in india without separate toilets for boys and girls'
p688
aS'brothers and sisters if we proceed with the dreams we are in a position to realise them'
p689
aS'today i wish to tell one more specific thing'
p690
aS'it has its own importance to discuss the matters and express the views of nations interest'
p691
aS'however our members of parliament do not get opportunity though they are willing to do something'
p692
aS'they can express themselves write to the government agitate give memoranda'
p693
aS'still they do not get opportunity to do something on their own'
p694
aS'today i have come to you with a new idea'
p695
aS'we are running so many schemes in the name of the prime minister in our country there are numerous schemes in the name of various leaders'
p696
aS'however today i am going to announce a scheme on behalf of the member of parliament- sansad aadarsh gram yojana'
p697
aS'we shall fix some parameters'
p698
aS'i urge upon the members of parliament to select any one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your constituency'
p699
aS'the parameters will be according to the time space and situation of that locality'
p700
aS'it will include the conditions of health cleanliness atmosphere greenery cordiality etc'
p701
aS'on the basis of those parameters each of our mps should make one village of his or her constituency a model village by 2016'
p702
aS'cant we do at least this'
p703
aS'shouldnt we do this'
p704
aS'if we have to build a nation we should start from the village'
p705
aS'make a model village'
p706
aS'the reason of fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme'
p707
aS'it takes time to formulate a scheme and then to implement it'
p708
aS'after 2016 select two more villages for this purpose before we go for the general elections in 2019'
p709
aS'and after 2019 each member of parliament during hisher tenure of 5 years must establish at-least five model villages in hisher area'
p710
aS'i also call upon the members of parliament from urban areas to adopt one village of their choice'
p711
aS'i also urge upon the members of parliament from rajya sabha to adopt one of the villages'
p712
aS'if we provide one model village in each district of india then the surrounding villages shall be automatically inspired to follow that model'
p713
aS'let us establish a model village let us establish a village well equipped with all systems and facilities'
p714
aS'the birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji happens to be on 11th october'
p715
aS'on 11th october the occasion of birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji i will present a complete blueprint of snsad adharsh grm yojana members of parliament model village scheme before all members of parliament and state governments and i urge upon state governments also that as per the feasibility in their respective states all the members of legislative assembly resolve to establish a model village'
p716
aS'you can imagine all the members of legislative assembly and all the members of parliament in the country establishing a model village'
p717
aS'all of a sudden there would be a model village in each block of india which could inspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new direction and therefore we want to move ahead under this snsad adarsh grm yojana'
p718
aS'my dear brothers and sisters ever since our government has taken charge there has been a discussion in the newspapers on t'
p719
aS'v'
p720
aS'channels as to what would happen to planning commission'
p721
aS'i believe that when planning commission was constituted it was done on the basis of the circumstances and the needs of those times'
p722
aS'in recent years planning commission has contributed to the growth of the country in its own way'
p723
aS'i respect that i am proud of that but the prevalent situation in the country is different global scenario has also changed governments are no longer the centre of economic activities the scope of such activities has broadened'
p724
aS'state governments have been at the center of development and i consider this a good indication'
p725
aS'if we have to take india forward it can happen only be taking the states forward'
p726
aS'indias federal structure is more important today than in the last 60 years'
p727
aS'to strengthen our federal structure to make our federal structure vibrant to take our federal structure as a heritage of development a team of chief minister and prime minister should be there a joint team of the centre and the states should move forward then to do this job we will have to think about giving the planning commission a look'
p728
aS'so i am saying from the rampart of the red fort that it is a very old system and it will have to be rejuvenated it will have to be changed a lot'
p729
aS'sometimes it costs more to repair the old house but it gives us no satisfaction'
p730
aS'thereafter we have a feeling that it would be better to construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period we will replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new design and structure a new body a new soul a new thinking a new direction a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country based on creative thinking public-private partnership optimum utilization of resources utilization of youth power of the nation to promote the aspirations of state governments seeking development to empower the state governments and to empower the federal structure'
p731
aS'very shortly we are about to move in a direction when this institute would be functioning in place of planning commission'
p732
aS'brothers and sisters today on 15th august we also have the birth anniversary of maharishi aurobindo'
p733
aS'maharishi aurobindo being a rebel moved on to achieve the status of a yoga guru'
p734
aS'with regard to the destiny of india he remarked i have a faith that the divine power and spiritual heritage of india will play an important role towards the welfare of the world'
p735
aS'such sentiments were echoed by maharishi arvind'
p736
aS'i strongly believe in the words of legends'
p737
aS'i have great faith in the statements made by ascetics sages saints and thats why today at the ramparts of lal quila i am reminded of the words of swami viveknanda'
p738
aS'he had said - i can see before my eyes mother india awakening once again'
p739
aS'my mother india would be seated as the world guru'
p740
aS'every indian would render service towards welfare of humanity'
p741
aS'this legacy of india would be useful for the welfare of the world'
p742
aS'these words were spoken by swami viveknanda ji in his own style'
p743
aS'friends the words of viveknanda ji can never be untrue'
p744
aS'the words of viveknanda ji his dream of seeing india ensconced as world guru his vision it is incumbent upon us to realize that dream'
p745
aS'this capable country blessed with natural bounty this country of youth can do much for the world in the coming days'
p746
aS'brothers and sisters our foreign policy is a much talked about issue'
p747
aS'i clearly believe that indias foreign policy can be multi-dimensional'
p748
aS'but there is an important issue to which i want to draw your attention that the way we fought for freedom we fought together we were not separate at that time'
p749
aS'we were together'
p750
aS'which was the government with us'
p751
aS'what were the weapons available to us'
p752
aS'there was a gandhi a sardar and lakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge empire'
p753
aS'didnt we win in the struggle of freedom against that empire'
p754
aS'did we not defeat the foreign powers'
p755
aS'did we not force them to leave india'
p756
aS'we were the ones they were our ancestors only who showed this might'
p757
aS'if the people of india could remove such a big empire without the power of the government without weapons and even without resources then friends it is the need of the hour to eradicate poverty can we not overcome poverty'
p758
aS'can we not defeat poverty'
p759
aS'my 125 crore dear countrymen let us resolve to eradicate poverty to win against it'
p760
aS'let us move with the dream of poverty eradication from india'
p761
aS'our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same problem'
p762
aS'why not get together with all the saarc nations to plan out the fight against poverty'
p763
aS'lets fight together and defeat poverty'
p764
aS'let us see at-least for once as to how wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of killing and getting killed'
p765
aS'this is the land where incidents from siddharths life happened'
p766
aS'one bird was shot with an arrow by one brother and the other took out that arrow to save it'
p767
aS'they went to mother- whose bird whose swan'
p768
aS'whether killers or saviours they asked of mother'
p769
aS'the mother replied saviours'
p770
aS'the saviour has more power than the killer and that makes him buddha in future'
p771
aS'and thats why i seek cooperation from neighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert and cooperate with them so that together with saarc countries we can create our importance and emerge as a power in the world'
p772
aS'it is imperative that we work together with a dream to win a fight against poverty shoulder to shoulder'
p773
aS'i went to bhutan nepal all the dignitaries from saarc countries took part in oath-taking ceremony this marked a good beginning'
p774
aS'this will definitely yield good results it is my belief and this thinking of india in the country and the world that we want to do well to the countrymen and be useful for the welfare of the world india wants such a hand to be extended'

p795
aS'gradually this inspiring chapter is losing its importance perhaps there would be many schools where 5th september is not remembered in this form'
p796
aS'this has become limited to giving awards to teacher and having ceremonies'
p797
aS'need of the hour is to underline the importance of a teacher in our social life'
p798
aS'till the time we dont accept this importance neither will we feel the honour for a teacher nor be successful in changing the new generation through the medium of teachers'
p799
aS'that is why there is a need to update this great tradition and reenergise it'
p800
aS'there is a need for debate on the reasons why many bright students do not want to become teachers'
p801
aS'all of us have to find the answer to this question'
p802
aS'in a global context it is believed that there is a great demand for teachers and good teachers are in short supply'
p803
aS'india is a young nation'
p804
aS'cant india dream of exporting teachers of high calibre'
p805
aS'cant we instil this desire in the heart of todays children that i will become a great teacher and will contribute in the progress of my country'
p806
aS'how to rekindle this feeling'
p807
aS'dr'
p808
aS'sarvapalli radhakrishnan has done a great service to this country'
p809
aS'he never used to celebrate his birthday as he insisted that the birthday of a teacher should be observed'
p810
aS'this concept of teachers day is now prevalent in many countries'
p811
aS'ask any great person in the world about the success in the life he or she will definitely tell two things'
p812
aS'first this is my mothers contribution and second my teachers contribution'
p813
aS'we get to hear this from about almost every great personalities'
p814
aS'but it holds importance only to the point till we follow it diligently'
p815
aS'there was a time when this feeling was there for a teacher'
p816
aS'if there was one most respected figure in the entire village it was the teacher'
p817
aS'his word was final'
p818
aS'gradually this situation has changed considerably'
p819
aS'however we can establish it once again'
p820
aS'as a child you might be having many questions'
p821
aS'many of you must be finding difficult to enjoy holidays and will be eagerly waiting for monday so that you can go and tell the teacher what all was done on sunday'
p822
aS'things which cant be told to mother brother and sister one feels so eager to tell ones teacher'
p823
aS'this is the level of closeness'
p824
aS'the same teacher changes hisher life'
p825
aS'teachers word brings the major change in the life of a student'
p826
aS'i know of many students who talk like their teache dress like their teacher he is their hero'
p827
aS'this is a stage which needs to be enlivened to strengthen our new genearation'
p828
aS'there is a saying in china that those who think only for a year they sow foodgrains those who thinks for a decade they plant fruits'
p829
aS'but those who thinks for generations they prepare humans'
p830
aS'it means to educate to imbibe culture and to prepare someone for life'
p831
aS'how can we make our education system come alive with a zeal for life building'
p832
aS'i have said on 15th august that i want no school should remain without toilet for girls by the end of this year'
p833
aS'a number of schools do not have toilets for girls'
p834
aS'some schools do not have toilets even for boys'
p835
aS'many may feel that this job is not worthy of a prime minister'
p836
aS'but when i went into details i found that this is a highly important job'
p837
aS'however for this i need help from every school of the country and all the teachers who are listening for creating an enabling environment for this'
p838
aS'i was there in japan couple of days ago'
p839
aS'an indian family met me the wife was japanese and the husband who was indian came to me and said that i heard your independence day speech'
p840
aS'you are insisting on cleanliness'
p841
aS'there is a rule here in japan that all of us teachers and the students together clean the school'
p842
aS'even the toilets are cleaned collectively'

p844
aS'why is it not so in india'
p845
aS'i said that i have to go back and ask mediapeople otherwise it will run for 24 hours'
p846
aS'once when i was in gujarat there was a programme on tv that was running that school children were cleaning the school'
p847
aS'what kind of a school was that what type of management was this what teachers exploitation of children'
p848
aS'anyway i made light of that event'
p849
aS'however how will we make this a national trait'
p850
aS'this can happen'
p851
aS'i call upon the senior people of the country'
p852
aS'you may be doctors lawyers ias officers or ips officers'
p853
aS'cant you identify a school nearby and volunteer to teach there for at least one period after deciding appropriate subject with the school'
p854
aS'if every educated indian volunteer for one period of teaching every week'
p855
aS'howsoever senior an officer why cant he or she can spend some time once in a week with children and teach them something'
p856
aS'please tell me if we agree that there are problems in the education system like lack of good teachers etc cant this be rectified'
p857
aS'why cant we convert nation-building into a peoples movement'
p858
aS'we should align everybodys strength'
p859
aS'we are not a country that should be left behind'
p860
aS'we can go ahead a great deal'
p861
aS'for this our emphasis should be on national character building'
p862
aS'there should be collective efforts and this can be done'
p863
aS'as a student you might be having many dreams'
p864
aS'i dont believe that situations in life can stop anyone'
p865
aS'if the determination is strong then i believe that youngsters and children of this country have the strength and talent to move forward'
p866
aS'importance of technology is increasing day by day'
p867
aS'i will request all the teachers that if something is needed to be learnt it should be learnt'
p868
aS'we should keep on learning irrespective of our age being 40 45 or 50'
p869
aS'we are living with children who are growing in the age of technology'
p870
aS'we should not keep them deprived from this'
p871
aS'that will be a social crime'
p872
aS'our efforts should be that our children should be well versed with modern science and technology'
p873
aS'the child should get ample opportunity to know the world in this form'
p874
aS'this should be our effort'
p875
aS'sometimes i ask this from children'
p876
aS'i want to ask you also a question will you reply'
p877
aS'how many children sweat profusely four times in a day'
p878
aS'how many'
p879
aS'there is no one'

aS'will you do that'
p883

aS'how many of you have hobby of reading books outside your curriculum'
p888
aS'it seems there is a good number of such children'
p889
aS'how many of you like to read autobiographies'
p890
aS'it seems there are very few such children'
p891
aS'i ask children to read biography of the person whom they like most'
p892
aS'by reading biography we come closer to the history'
p893
aS'we know the contemporary history by reading about the life of a person'
p894
aS'it is not necessary that we should read a particular type of biography only'
p895
aS'if someone wants to advance in sports he should read biography of the person from that field'
p896
aS'if someone has done well in cinema and you get the chance to read his biography you must read'
p897
aS'if someone has done well in the field of business his biography should be read'
p898
aS'it someone has worked as scientist his autobiography should be read'
p899
aS'by reading biography we get the chance to come closer to the history and to understand what truth is'
p900
aS'we should strive for that'
p901
aS'otherwise everything is done by google guru and you have the habit to go to google if you have a question'
p902
aS'one gets the information but not the knowledge'
p903
aS'i have been told some students have questions i would like to chat with them'

aS'then i ask these people did you like the fact that it was so clean'
p1261
aS'then i ask did you see anyone littering or spitting'
p1262

p1264
aS'if we manage that i am sure we will do wonders'
p1265
aS'one more work is there that of building toilets'
p1266

p1297
aS'i believe that the countries of the world that appear clean are so because their citizens dont indulge in littering nor do they allow it to happen'
p1298
aS'with this firms belief i will propagate the message of swachh bharat mission in villages and towns'
p1299
aS'i will encourage 100 other persons to take this pledge which i am taking today'
p1300
aS'i will endeavour to make them devote their 100 hours for cleanliness'
p1301

p1308
aS'i will try my best if possible to take out time twice a month or even once to speak with you'
p1309
aS'in future i have also decided that whenever i will speak to you it would be on sundays and time would be morning 11'
p1310
aS'in that way it would be convenient for you too and i will feel contented with the fact that i am successful in sharing my thoughts with you'
p1311
aS'we are celebrating the festival of vijay dashami today which symbolises the triumph of good over evil'
p1312
aS'but one gentleman named ganesh venkatadari a native of mumbai sent me a mail and has written to me that we must take a vow to eliminate ten bad habits from within ourselves on this occasion of vijay dashami'
p1313
aS'i express my gratitude to him for this recommendation'
p1314
aS'we all as individuals must be thinking to put an end to all our bad habits and win over them although with respect to our nation i believe we all should come together and take a vow in eliminating all the dirt from our country'
p1315
aS'on this occasion of vijay dashami we must take a vow to eliminate dirt and filth and we can do so on this occasion'
p1316
aS'yesterday on 2nd october on the eve of mahatma gandhis birth anniversary more than 1'
p1317
aS'25 crore countrymen have started the swachh bharat movement'
p1318
aS'i had shared one thought yesterday which is that i will nominate nine people and they need to upload their videos of cleaning the nation on social media websites and nominating nine more people to do the same'
p1319
aS'i want you all to join me clean the nation and nominate nine more people to clean the nation and those nine people must do the same'
p1320
aS'eventually the entire nation will have this atmosphere'
p1321
aS'i strongly believe that you all will join hands with me to carry this movement forward'
p1322
aS'whenever we think of mahatma gandhi naturally we are reminded of khaadi'
p1323
aS'you may be wearing variety of clothes with different fabrics and company brands in your family'
p1324
aS'but is it not possible to include khaadi too'
p1325
aS'i am not telling you to use only khaadi products'
p1326
aS'i am just insisting to use at least one khaadi product like handkerchief or a bath towel a bed sheet a pillow cover a curtain or anything of that kind'
p1327
aS'if you have an inclination for all kinds of fabrics and clothes in your family you can also buy khaadi products on a regular basis'
p1328
aS'i am saying this as when you buy khaadi products it helps poor people to light lamps on diwali'
p1329
aS'also you can avail a special discount on khaadi products from 2nd october for a month'
p1330
aS'it is a very small thing but has very big impact which binds you with the poor'
p1331
aS'how you see this as a success'
p1332
aS'when i speak of 1'
p1333
aS'25 crore countrymen and infer the outcome we might assume that government will take care of everything and as individuals we stand nowhere'
p1334
aS'we have seen that if we intend to progress then we need to identify our potential understand our strengths and i can swear that we form the incomparable souls of this world'
p1335
aS'you all know that our own scientists have been successful in reaching mars bearing least expenses'
p1336
aS'we do not lack in our strengths but have forgotten our strong points'
p1337
aS'we have forgotten ourselves'
p1338
aS'we have become hopeless'
p1339
aS'my dear brothers and sisters i can not let this happen'
p1340
aS'i always remember one of the sayings by swami vivekananda ji as he always used to emphasize on one thought and possibly he might have shared this thought with many others'
p1341
aS'vivekananda ii used to say once a lioness was carrying her two cubs on the way and came upon a flock of sheep from a distance'
p1342
aS'she got a desire to prey upon them and started running towards the flock'
p1343
aS'seeing her running one of the cub too joined her'
p1344
aS'the other cub was left behind and the lioness moved on post preying upon the flock'
p1345
aS'one of the cub went with the lioness but the other cub was left behind and was brought up by a mother sheep'
p1346
aS'he grew among the sheep started speaking their language and adapted their ways of life'
p1347
aS'he used to sit laugh and enjoy with them'
p1348
aS'the cub who went with the lioness was a grown-up now'
p1349
aS'once he happened to meet his brother and was shocked to see him'
p1350
aS'he thought in his mind he is a lion and is playing with sheep talking like sheep'
p1351
aS'what is wrong with him'
p1352
aS'he felt that his ego was at stake and went to talk to his brother'
p1353
aS'he said what are you doing brother'
p1354
aS'you are a lion'
p1355
aS'he gets a reply from his brother no i am a sheep'
p1356
aS'i grew up with them'
p1357
aS'they have brought me up'
p1358
aS'listen to my voice and the way i talk'
p1359
aS'he said come i will show you who you really are'
p1360
aS'he took his brother to a well and told him to look in the water his own reflection and asked him if both of them had similar faces'
p1361
aS'i am a lion you too are a lion'
p1362
aS'his brothers self-esteem got awakened he attained self-realization through this and even a lion brought up among sheep started roaring like a lion'
p1363
aS'his inner entity was awakened'
p1364
aS'swami vivekananda ji used to say the same'
p1365
aS'my countrymen 125 crore indians have indefinite strengths and capabilities'
p1366
aS'we need to understand ourselves'
p1367
aS'we need to identify our inner strengths and like swami ji always used to say we need to carry our self-respect identify ourselves and move forward in life and be successful which in turn make our nation a winning and successful country'
p1368
aS'i believe all our countrymen with a population of 125 crores are efficient strong and can stand against any odds with confidence'
p1369
aS'these days i have been getting many letters through social media websites like facebook from my friends'
p1370
aS'one of them mr gautam pal has addressed an issue regarding the specially-abled children'
p1371
aS'he has suggested forming separate municipality municipal corporation or councils for them'
p1372
aS'we need to plan something for them for enhancing their moral support'
p1373
aS'i liked his suggestion and i have experienced this during my day as chief minister of gujarat'
p1374
aS'a special olympics was held in athens in 2011'
p1375
aS'after the olympics i had called all the participants and winners of specially-abled category from gujarat to my home'
p1376
aS'i spent two hours with them and it was the most emotional and inspiring incident of my life'
p1377
aS'as i believe a specially-abled child is not only the responsibility of the parents in a family it is the responsibility of the entire society'
p1378
aS'god has chosen this family to support a specially-abled child but a child is a responsibility of the entire nation'
p1379
aS'after this incident i got so emotionally attached with them i started organizing separate olympics for them in gujarat'
p1380
aS'thousands of children with their parents used to come and attend i too used to attend the olympics'
p1381
aS'there was an atmosphere of trust and this is the reason i liked the suggestion given by mr gautam pal and i felt like sharing this thought with you'
p1382
aS'it reminds me of another story'
p1383
aS'once a traveller was sitting at the corner of a road and was asking everyone the way to a specific place'
p1384
aS'he continued asking the route from many people'
p1385
aS'a man sitting beside him was observing him'
p1386
aS'the traveller stood up and started asking passers-by again'
p1387
aS'he stood up and said the way to your destination is here'
p1388
aS'the traveller then said brother you were sitting next to me for so long saw me asking everyone the route'
p1389
aS'if you knew the route why didnt you tell me before'
p1390
aS'the man answered i was waiting to verify if you really intend to reach your destination or you are asking people just for your knowledge'
p1391
aS'but when you stood up i was assured that you truly wish to reach your destination and decided to confirm the address'
p1392
aS'my countrymen till the time we do not decide to walk stand on our own we will also not the get the guidance from others in our journey'
p1393
aS'we will not get the people to hold our hand and help us in walking'
p1394
aS'we need to take the initiative in walking and i trust all my 125 crore indians who are capable of walking on their own and will keep moving'
p1395
aS'for the past few days i have been getting very interesting suggestions from people'
p1396
aS'i am aware when to adapt to these suggestions'
p1397
aS'but i want everyone to actively participate in these suggestions as we all belong to our nation the nation does not only belong to any government'
p1398
aS'we are the citizens of our nation and we all need to unite without any exceptions'
p1399
aS'some of you have suggested simplifying the registration process for small scale industries'
p1400
aS'i will definitely put this under governments notice'
p1401
aS'some of you have written to me to incorporate skills development courses in the school curriculum from 5th standard'
p1402
aS'this will help the students to learn various skills and crafts'
p1403
aS'i loved this effective suggestion given by them'
p1404
aS'they have also suggested that even the adults should learn skills development courses along with their studies'
p1405
aS'one of the suggestions given was to keep a dustbin at every 100 meters and a cleaning system should be established'
p1406
aS'some of you have written to me to abolish the use of plastic bags'
p1407
aS'i am receiving numerous suggestions from people'
p1408
aS'i have always been telling you to write to me and narrate a true incident which is positive and inspiring to me and our countrymen along with the evidence'
p1409
aS'if you do this i can promise this to you that i will share all those heartfelt thoughts or suggestions with all our countrymen through mann ki baat'
p1410
aS'i have only one intention in speaking with you all come let us serve our mother india'
p1411
aS'let us all take our nation to the new heights'
p1412
aS'let us all take a step forward'
p1413
aS'if you take one step our nation takes 125 crore steps to move forward and for this purpose on this auspicious occasion of vijay dashami we all need to defeat all of our inner evils and decide to start doing something good for the nation'
p1414
aS'today is the fortunate beginning for me'
p1415
aS'i will be sharing my heartfelt thoughts with one and all'
p1416
aS'today i have shared all the thoughts coming directly from my heart'
p1417
aS'i will meet you all next at 11 am on sundays but i trust our journey shall never end and will continue receiving love and suggestions from you'
p1418
aS'after listening to my thoughts please do not hesitate in sharing your thoughts or advice to me i will appreciate that your suggestions keep coming'
p1419
aS'i am glad to talk with you through this simple medium of radio which serves each and every corner of the nation'
p1420
aS'i can reach the poorest homes as mine my nations strength lies within the hut of poor within the villages my nations strength lies with the mothers sisters and youths my nations strength lies with the farmers'
p1421
aS'nation will only progress if you believe in it'
p1422
aS'i am expressing my trust towards the nation'
p1423
aS'i believe in your strength hence i believe in our nations future'
p1424
aS'i would once again like to thank one and all for taking out time and listening to me'
p1425
aS'thank you all'
p1426
aS'all the governments that have come to power in india since independence have been working for rural development in their own ways'
p1427
aS'these efforts should continue relentlessly while adapting with time'
p1428
aS'plans should be made according to changing times and the speed of change should gain pace in accordance with the pace of the world'
p1429
aS'this is an ever-continuing process'
p1430
aS'however it is important to introduce some new elements each time to speed up and enliven this process'
p1431
aS'every state of india has at least 5 to 10 villages that it can be proud of'
p1432
aS'there is a different feeling when we enter such villages'
p1433
aS'if government planning creates these villages then there should have been more of such villages'
p1434
aS'since there are only a few it means there is something extra apart from government plans'
p1435
aS'this something extra is the soul of saansad adarsh gram yojana'
p1436
aS'plans exist for all villages but some villages progressed as there were some people in those villages with a different thought process'
p1437
aS'some leaders who led differently to bring about these changes'
p1438
aS'it is not that there are no other better villages'
p1439
aS'there are'
p1440
aS'and they have been built by our people only'
p1441
aS'need of the hour is to bring some changes in the decision making process and the beginning has to be made somewhere'
p1442
aS'today is the birth anniversary of jayaprakash narayan ji a vibrant young force of freedom struggle'
p1443
aS'the way he led his life after independence keeping away from politics and dedicating himself to creative work alone is a source of inspiration for all of us'
p1444
aS'there was always a shadow of gandhiji and vinobaji on his thoughts'
p1445
aS'lohiaji was also an influence'
p1446
aS'he said that gram dharma is an important thing and till the time our villages dont think or move as a society gram dharma is not possible'
p1447
aS'and if gram dharma is possible then the village can choose its path to new heights'
p1448
aS'the village was always present in mahatma gandhis life'
p1449
aS'gandhi ji returned from abroad in 1915'
p1450
aS'within two years he implemented what he had learnt in champaran bihar where he fought for the rights of people'
p1451
aS'it was done with peoples participation'
p1452
aS'the seeds of freedom struggle were sowed by gandhi ji in villages only'
p1453
aS'today is also the birth anniversary of shri nanaji deshmukh - a close comrade of jai prakash narayan ji'
p1454
aS'nanaji dedicated himself to the development of jaiprabha nagar near chitrakoot which was named after jai prakash narayan and his wife prabha devi'
p1455
aS'based on the model of jaiprabha nagar he worked to make rural life self-sufficient in many villages of uttar pradesh'
p1456
aS'our former president abdul kalam ji visited these villages and mentioned them in many of his speeches'
p1457
aS'the point is today we have to take the adarsh gram yojana forward with our mps guidance mps leadership and mps efforts'
p1458
aS'for the time being we have thought of a total of three villages in this term'
p1459
aS'one model village should be achieved by 2016 and based on that experience two more model villages are to be achieved by 2019'
p1460
aS'later every year one village can be done by a mp'
p1461
aS'we are almost 800 mps and if we do three villages before 2019 then 2500 villages will be covered'
p1462
aS'if the states also make schemes for their mlas based on this scheme then six-seven thousand more villages can be added'
p1463
aS'if a village in a block improves then it doesnt stop there'
p1464
aS'it is adopted by nearby villages also'
p1465
aS'they also discuss what is being done and how it can be replicated'
p1466
aS'this can initiate a viral effect'
p1467
aS'that is why it is important how we lay its foundation'
p1468
aS'for a long time this debate has been going on in the country about whether development model should be top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top'
p1469
aS'let the discussion go on'
p1470
aS'academic discussions have their own importance'
p1471
aS'but the responsibility of doers is to do'
p1472
aS'we need to start somewhere'
p1473
aS'so let us sit at the bottom and look at one village in our constituency at least'
p1474
aS'many people dont understand the biggest benefit from this'
p1475
aS'today an mp is engaged in tackling problems of the public in his constituency'
p1476
aS'irrespective of the party the mp is accountable and has to perform'
p1477
aS'however most of his or her time and energy is spent in immediate problems'
p1478
aS'secondly hisher energy and time is spent in getting work done from the government and officers'
p1479
aS'i cant say whether i will be able to change this'
p1480
aS'what happens to mplads funds'
p1481
aS'constituency people demand this or that'
p1482
aS'then it is distributed given to government officers with an instruction that it should please most of the village'
p1483
aS'only small schemes are undertaken ultimately'
p1484
aS'this is the kind of work which with focused activities can make the mp feel that his her name will be associated with the village for years to come'
p1485
aS'the village always remember that earlier the village was like this and one mp came and changed all that'
p1486
aS'today there are many government schemes'
p1487
aS'an mp might be coming in touch with these schemes only in parts'
p1488
aS'what is the problem in uniting the streams of these different schemes'
p1489
aS'what are the shortcomings and what are the ways to improve'
p1490
aS'once an mp starts discussing this in the village many deficiencies of government system will be revealed'
p1491
aS'it is not a small risk that i have taken here'
p1492
aS'however on the basis of my knowledge and experience i can say that once an mp is associated with this many problems will come to the fore'
p1493
aS'this will lead to a change in system'
p1494
aS'then everybody will think that if we have changed one village then we can do the same elsewhere also'
p1495
aS'what happens now a days'
p1496
aS'a scheme comes to a village'
p1497
aS'a water tank is dug at one place tube-well at other place'
p1498
aS'if there is tube-well there is no water tank and vice-versa'
p1499
aS'expenditure is done but without outcome'
p1500
aS'that is why the mp is going to be involved in every activity of village life to bring the focus on the outcome'
p1501
aS'there is a flexibility in this programme to choose any village'
p1502
aS'if possible it should have a population of 3000-5000'
p1503
aS'this does not mean that smaller or bigger habitations are not be touched'
p1504
aS'this is flexible'
p1505
aS'but if approximately 3000 to 5000 population is there then a system can be worked out'
p1506
aS'in hilly and tribal areas where such big villages are not there the number should be between 1000 to 3000'
p1507
aS'only one condition has been imposed by me'
p1508
aS'and that is that the mps must not pick their own village or village of their in-laws'
p1509
aS'apart from this choose any village'
p1510
aS'even i have to select a village in varanasi'
p1511
aS'a guideline has been brought out today'
p1512
aS'i will also go to varanasi and talk to the people there and after consultation will select the village'
p1513
aS'one of the biggest problems for us has been that our development model has been supply-driven'
p1514
aS'a scheme has been prepared in lucknow gandhi nagar or delhi'
p1515
aS'the same is attempted to be injected'
p1516
aS'we want to shift this model from supply-driven to demand driven through aadrash gram'
p1517
aS'there should be an urge developed in the village itself'
p1518
aS'the villagers should themselves come out and tell us what they need'
p1519
aS'this scheme is not just to construct a bridge or a pond'
p1520
aS'can a change be brought about in our todays conditions or not'
p1521
aS'someone please tell me that if there is a school panchayat ghar temple or a place of worship in the village should not that be clean'
p1522
aS'do we need a budget to tell us this'
p1523
aS'i have been lucky not many people in political life may have been so lucky'
p1524
aS'i have travelled for 45 years'
p1525
aS'must have stayed overnight in more than 400 districts of india'
p1526
aS'there must have been at least 5000 villages outside gujarat that i visited'
p1527
aS'therefore i understand these things from experience'
p1528
aS'we should create a confidence in the villages and make them committed to this'
p1529
aS'please tell me in a village of 3000 to 5000 how many deliveries take place in a year'
p1530
aS'maximum 100'
p1531
aS'out of these 50-60 women will be economically sound'
p1532
aS'25-30 women will be such who will need the villages support for nutrition'
p1533
aS'if this happens the chances of malnutrition in the child and maternal mortality will be reduced drastically'
p1534
aS'if this was to be done by government of india then a cabinet note would have been prepared departments comments would have been taken tender would have been floated'
p1535
aS'and everyone knows what happens after the tender is floated'
p1536
aS'then six months later some breaking news would have come in newspapers'
p1537
aS'in this no tender budget cabinet or minister is needed'
p1538
aS'people of the village will collectively decide that if 25 women are expecting and they are poor then the village will take care of the extra nutritional food for three-four months'
p1539
aS'i say friends this is easy'
p1540
aS'all we need is to change our mind set'
p1541
aS'we need to unite peoples hearts'
p1542
aS'normally mps are engaged in political activities but after this when they will come to the village there will be no political activities'
p1543
aS'it will be like family'
p1544
aS'decisions will be taken sitting with the people of the villages'
p1545
aS'it will re-energise and unite the village'
p1546
aS'problems will be solved'
p1547
aS'currently there is a mid-day meal scheme run by the government'
p1548
aS'it is a good thing should be there'
p1549
aS'often there are 80-100 families in the village who celebrate occasions like birthdays death anniversaries of family elders etc'
p1550
aS'they should be contacted and be told that when such celebratory occasions come they should come go to the school with family'
p1551
aS'they should bring some sweets to the school and sit with the students for the mid-day meal and share with them'
p1552
aS'this will lead to a good movement of social harmony'
p1553
aS'at the same time this can also work as input to improve the quality of the mid-day meal'
p1554
aS'this doesnt require any big scheme we can take this forward cant we'
p1555
aS'government is planning to establish gobar gas plants in villages'
p1556
aS'as you know some one or two persons avail it due to their capacity to get government money'
p1557
aS'but cow dung is not available'
p1558
aS'then in one or two years the plant becomes a monument'
p1559
aS'how many monuments will you keep building'
p1560
aS'now imagine that there is a gobar bank of the village'
p1561
aS'the entire cow dung in the village can be deposited in such a bank and a common gas plant is built with this'
p1562
aS'gas is supplied to the entire village'
p1563
aS'our mothers and sisters suffer a lot due to smoke from the chulhas'
p1564
aS'i am seeing an opportunity which doesnt involve expenditure'
p1565
aS'those who would deposit the gobar will get the same amount during the agriculture season as fertilizer'
p1566
aS'this will also bring cleanliness in the village along with fertilizer and gas'
p1567
aS'improvement in health parameters due to clean village will be an extra benefit'
p1568
aS'i say that we should take interest in creating such an atmosphere in the village'
p1569
aS'sometimes i think are we able to create an atmosphere where people can be proud of village'
p1570
aS'unless we create such an atmosphere change will not come'
p1571
aS'this is very important'
p1572
aS'every village has its birthday why should it not be celebrated like a festival when everybody will come together they will think about what can be done for the village'
p1573
aS'i think government schemes were always the foundation of adarsh gram yojana'
p1574
aS'there is no change in that'
p1575
aS'but this is an experiment to fill the gaps'
p1576
aS'if i think that it is the ultimate solution i will be disbelieving in the thinking power of humanity'
p1577
aS'no thinking is complete every thinking moves towards completeness'
p1578
aS'therefore i believe nothing is ultimate'
p1579
aS'whatever has happened is good'
p1580
aS'whatever is happening today is step forward'
p1581
aS'it will not work if we consider it a full stop'
p1582
aS'the point is that as per requirement the government should have flexibility'
p1583
aS'it should not work by diktat but it should facilitate'
p1584
aS'i say this with full faith that any mp will develop his or her village as a place of pilgrimage after 2016'
p1585
aS'heshe will tell hisher relatives that i have built a village lets go and see that'
p1586
aS'this is the satisfaction level that leads to solutions in the life of a person'
p1587
aS'jai prakash narayan ji had said an important thing which i believe is inspiring even in these times'
p1588
aS'he said that democracy and politics can not be separated'
p1589
aS'politics is democracys second nature'
p1590
aS'this is important'
p1591
aS'we are fed up of dirty politics'
p1592
aS'dirty politics gives a bad name to the entire political field'
p1593
aS'this or that party is not the issue'
p1594
aS'an atmosphere of trust has suffered'
p1595
aS'jai prakash narayan ji said something very good'
p1596
aS'he said that freedom from politics is not the way'
p1597
aS'we should see how fast liberal and good politics takes the place of dirty politics'
p1598
aS'i believe that sansad aadarsh gram yojna is opening a new door of creative politics'
p1599
aS'will i get votes in the village'
p1600
aS'are the communities in the village my supporters'
p1601
aS'am i on good terms with the local leaders in the village'
p1602
aS'we need to rise above all this and leave it all outside the village boundaries when we do this work'
p1603
aS'here the village is a community a cohesive society'
p1604
aS'can i be a facilitator or a catalytic agent to fulfil their dreams'
p1605
aS'can i work as a friend with a feeling of oneness'
p1606
aS'when in 2016 this will be discussed in the parliament mps will speak in the parliament on the basis of the experience'
p1607
aS'howsoever insensitive the government may be it will have to acknowledge the experience of the parliamentarian'
p1608
aS'howsoever strong might be the majority of the government it will have to change its policies'
p1609
aS'weight of the parliamentarian is going to increase'
p1610
aS'no government will be able to deny this because the mp will say that i went to the village i am working these are the problems in my village the policies of your government are wrong your schemes are incorrect and your officers dont understand'
p1611
aS'the power of these words will become the reason for change in the governments policies'
p1612
aS'this country is going to choose bottom-to-top approach'
p1613
aS'in the academic word bottom-to-top top-to-bottom approaches are discussed'
p1614
aS'but we want to make a beginning somewhere'
p1615
aS'for this i say demand-driven and not supply-driven'
p1616
aS'can we choose a society-driven development approach rather than a government-driven one'
p1617
aS'can we increase peoples participants along with government facilitation'
p1618
aS'we were just watching a video about a village in andhra'
p1619
aS'they have set up 28 committees in such a small village'
p1620
aS'all are functional there are not for show'
p1621
aS'and they have done it'
p1622
aS'if we take this inspiration if today parliamentarians and tomorrow mlas will take forward 7-8 thousands villages every year it will create a viral effect that will change the entire model of development of rural clusters'
p1623
aS'we should understand that the aspirations of a rural person are no less than an urban person'
p1624
aS'he is also watching the world and wants a change in his quality of life'
p1625
aS'he also wants good education for his children'
p1626
aS'if long distance education is available he wants it'
p1627
aS'lets talk about drip irrigation'
p1628
aS'who can deny that there is a water crisis everywhere'
p1629
aS'wont i place drip irrigation in every field of my chosen village'
p1630
aS'ill bring all the schemes of the government will help them in getting loans from banks'
p1631
aS'can i increase their production through drip irrigation'
p1632
aS'economy of the village will change'
p1633
aS'there will be cattle rearing and increased milk production improved situation of cattle'
p1634
aS'i will bring officers explain things to them and bring change'
p1635
aS'friends i believe that rural life can be changed'
p1636
aS'those mps who have been elected from urban areas and dont have any village i request them to choose a nearby village'
p1637
aS'my friends from rajya sabha should select a village of their choice from the states from which they are coming'
p1638
aS'nominated mps can choose any village from all over india'
p1639
aS'we will all collectively try to open the door of creative politics and will work away from political untouchability'
p1640
aS'jai prakash ji mahatama gandhi ram manohar lohia ji pandit deen dayal ji are such icons of last century whose shadow is there on the political life of today'
p1641
aS'all may not have impacted all but everyone must have been influenced a little by someone'
p1642
aS'we should take inspiration from them and move this work ahead'
p1643
aS'this is my expectation from you'
p1644
aS'i said on 15th august that on 11th october on the birth anniversary of jai prakash ji we will present the guidelines'
p1645
aS'some of my friends informed me of their selection of village that evening itself'
p1646
aS'and they were not bjp mps alone'
p1647
aS'even mps from other parties for example even congress mps wrote to me'
p1648
aS'that day itself i felt that this concept has value'
p1649
aS'that is why people are adopting it beyond party politics'
p1650
aS'still there are many like me who have to select the village'
p1651
aS'it is pending in my area also because i wanted to decide after the guidelines are prepared and in consultation with the people and officers of varanasi'
p1652
aS'i will surely do this in the next 15-20 days'
p1653
aS'we should convey this confidence that there will be more villages in the future'
p1654
aS'a model is emerging'
p1655
aS'if we manage to show this model to villagers change will be automatic'
p1656
aS'we will bring about rural development by our efforts and not by diktat'
p1657
aS'the letter has been written and the job is done - this is not like that'
p1658
aS'this will not be accomplished by asking questions in the parliament'
p1659
aS'we need to work collectively'
p1660
aS'i believe that we are experimenting with a new way of serving mother india in a big way'
p1661
aS'i complement all the parliamentarians from the deepest core of my heart that all party members have accepted this welcomed this'
p1662
aS'this is not a final scheme there will be many changes many reforms many practical situations will emerge'
p1663
aS'this is not a money-related scheme'
p1664
aS'this scheme is people-driven and will be accomplished through peoples participation and parliamentarians guidance'
p1665
aS'we should take this forward'
p1666
aS'with this hope i thank you all'
p1667

p1703

p1704
aS'it is these festivals which bring happiness in our daily lives from time to time'

aS'be it poor or rich people from village or from urban areas festivals hold a different significance in everyones lives'
p1706
aS'this is my first meeting after diwali so i convey my very warm wishes to you all'
p1707
aS'last time we had some general conversation'
p1708
aS'but then i came to some new realizations after that conversation'
p1709
aS'sometimes we think leave it'
p1710
ag449
ag449
aS'nothing is going to change people are indifferent they will not do anything our country is like this'
p1711
aS'from my last conversation in mann ki baat to this one i would urge you all to change this mindset'
p1712
aS'neither is our country is like this nor our people indifferent'
p1713
aS'sometimes i feel the nation is way ahead and the government is lacking behind'
p1714
aS'and from my personal experience i will say that the governments too needs to change their mindsets'
p1715
aS'and i say that because i can see tremendous sense of commitment in the indian youth'
p1716
aS'they are very eager to do their bit and are just seeking an opportunity where they can do their bit'
p1717
aS'and they are making efforts at their own end'
p1718
aS'last time i had asked them to buy at least one khadi outfit'
p1719
aS'i had not asked anyone to be khadidhari but the feedback i got from khadi stores was that in a weeks time the sales had jumped up by 125'
p1720
aS'in this way as compared to last year the sales this year is more than double in the week following 2nd oct'
p1721
aS'this means the people of our country is many times more than we think of'
p1722
aS'i salute all my fellow indians'
p1723
aS'cleanliness'
p1724
ag449
aS'can anyone imagine that cleanliness will become a such a huge public movement'
p1725
aS'the expectations are high and they should be so'
p1726
aS'i can see some good results cleanliness can now be witnessed in two parts'
p1727
aS'one is those huge garbage piles which keep lying in the city well the people in the government will work to remove those'
p1728
aS'it is a big challenge but you can not run away from your responsibilities'
p1729
aS'all state governments and all municipalities will now have to take concrete actions due to the rising public pressure'
p1730
aS'media is playing a very positive role in this'
p1731
aS'but there is the second aspect which gives me immense pleasure happiness and a sense of satisfaction that the general public has started feeling that leave what happened in the past now they will not dirty their surroundings'
p1732
aS'we will not add to the existing dirt'
p1733
aS'a gentleman mr bharat gupta has sent me a mail on mygov'
p1734
aS'in from satna madhya pradesh'
p1735
aS'he has related his personal experience during his tour of the railways'
p1736
aS'he said that people eat on trains and usually litter around'
p1737
aS'he continues to say that he has been touring from the past many years but it is this time around no one was littering rather they were looking for dustbins to throw their trash'
p1738
aS'when they could not see any arrangements they collected all their litter in a corner'
p1739
aS'he says that it was a very gratifying experience for me'
p1740
aS'i thank bharat ji for sharing this experience with me'
p1741
aS'what i am seeing is that this campaign has had a great influence on kids'
p1742
aS'many families mention that now whenever kids eat a chocolate they themselves pick the wrapper and disposes it'
p1743
aS'i was seeing a message on the social media'
p1744
aS'someone had posted a picture with the title my hero of the day'
p1745
aS'this picture was that of a little kid who picks up trash wherever he goes even when going to school'
p1746
aS'he is himself motivated to do this'
p1747
aS'just seepeople now feel it is their country and they will not make it dirty'
p1748
aS'we will not add to the existing dirt pile'
p1749
aS'and those do litter feel ashamed for someone is around to point it out to them'
p1750
aS'i consider all these to be good omens'
p1751
aS'another thing is that many people come to meet me who are from all the sections of the society'
p1752
aS'they can be government officers from film world sports world industrialists scientists'
p1753
aS'all of them whenever they interact with me in ten minutes discussion about four to five minutes the discussion is on social issues'
p1754
aS'someone talks about cleanliness while some others talk about education while someone talks about social reforms'
p1755
aS'some people discuss the ruining of family life'
p1756
aS'i initially thought if a businessman comes he will definitely talk of things of his personal interest'
p1757
aS'but i am seeing a major change'
p1758
aS'they talk less about their interest and more about taking on some or the other social responsibility'
p1759
aS'when i add up all these small incidents i see a larger picture and i realize that we are moving in the right direction'
p1760
aS'it is true that unhealthy environment leads to diseases and sickness but where does sickness strike first'
p1761
aS'it first strikes the poor household'
p1762
aS'when we work towards cleanliness we make a major effort in the direction of helping the poor'
p1763
aS'if the poor families are saved from diseases then they will be saved from a lot of financial problems'
p1764
aS'if a person is healthy then he will work hard earn for the family and help in running the family smoothly'
p1765
aS'and so this cleanliness drive is directly related to the health and welfare of my poor brethren'
p1766
aS'we may not be able to do something to help the poor but even keeping the environs clean helps the poor in a big way'
p1767
aS'let us view it from this perspective it will be very beneficial'
p1768
aS'i receive different kinds of letters'
p1769
aS'last time i had mentioned about our specially abled children'
p1770
aS'whom god has given some kind of deficiencies i had expressed my feelings regarding those people'
p1771
aS'i see that people who work in this field are sending me their success stories'
p1772
aS'but i came to know about two things from my people in the government'
p1773
aS'the people from the hrd ministry after hearing my talk felt the need to do something'
p1774
aS'and the officers came together to work out an action plan'
p1775
aS'this is an example of how changes are coming about in governance'
p1776
aS'one they have decided that those specially abled who want to pursue technical education a thousand of them who are good will be selected for special scholarships and a plan has been made'
p1777
aS'i congratulate the officials who could think in those lines'
p1778
aS'another important decision is that all the kendriya vidyalayas and all central universities will have a special infrastructure for the specially abled for example if they cant climb stairs then there will be provision for ramps to facilitate movement by wheel chair'
p1779
aS'they need different kinds of toilets'
p1780
aS'the hrd ministry has decided to allocate an additional lakh rupees to the kendriya vidyalays and central universities'
p1781
aS'this fund will be used by these institutions to create infrastructure for the specially abled'
p1782
aS'this is an auspicious beginningthese things will lead us to change'
p1783
aS'i had the chance to visit siachin a few days back'
p1784
aS'i spent diwali with the jawans who are ready to lay down their lives for the nation'
p1785
aS'when the nation was celebrating diwali i was at siachin'
p1786
aS'it is because of them that we were able to celebrate diwali so i wanted to be with them'
p1787
aS'i experienced the difficulties in which they spent their time there'
p1788
aS'i salute all my jawans'
p1789
aS'but i want to share another matter of great pride with you'
p1790
aS'our jawans work in the field of security'
p1791
aS'in calamities they risk their lives to save our life'
p1792
aS'they also fetch medals for us in sporting events'
p1793
aS'you will be glad to know that these jawans have won a gold medal in a very prestigious event in britain called cambrian patrol defeating contestants from 140 nations'
p1794
aS'i offer these jawans my heartiest congratulations'
p1795
aS'i also got an opportunity to meet the young and dynamic students boys and girls over tea who had won medals in sports'
p1796
aS'they give me renewed energy'
p1797
aS'i was seeing their zeal and enthusiasm'
p1798
aS'the facilities in our country are quite less as compared to other nations but instead of complaining they were just sharing their joy and excitement'
p1799
aS'for me this tea programme for these players was very inspiring and i felt really good'
p1800
aS'i would like to tell you something more and that too from my heart'
p1801
aS'i truly believe that people of my country trust my words and my intentions'
p1802
aS'but today one more time i want to reiterate my commitment'
p1803
aS'as far as black money is concerned my people please trust your prime servant for me this is the article of faith'
p1804
aS'this is my commitment that the hard-earned money of the poor people stashed abroad every penny of that should be brought back'
p1805
aS'the ways and means to be followed can be different'
p1806
aS'and this is very obvious in a democratic country but on the basis of as much i understand and as much i know i assure you that we are on the right track'
p1807
aS'today nobody neither me nor the government nor you nor even the previous government knew how much money is stashed abroad'
p1808
aS'everyone gives estimate calculated in hisher own way'
p1809
aS'i dont want to get lost in some such figures and estimates its my commitment that be it 2 rupees or 5 rupees or millions or even billions this is the hard-earned money of the poor people of my country and it has to come back'
p1810
aS'and i assure you that i will keep trying till the end'
p1811
aS'no efforts will be spared'
p1812
aS'i want your blessings to be always with me'
p1813
aS'i assure you that i will do whatever and whenever something is required to be done for you'
p1814
aS'i give my commitment to you'
p1815
aS'i have received a letter'
p1816
aS'it has been sent by sri abhishek pareekh'
p1817
aS'the same sentiments were expressed to me by many mothers and sisters when i was not even the prime minister'
p1818
aS'some doctor friends had also expressed their concern and i too have expressed my views on this issue a number of times in the past'
p1819
aS'mr parikh has drawn my attention towards the increase of drug addiction that is fast catching up with our young generation'
p1820
aS'he has asked me to discuss this topic in mann ki baat'
p1821
aS'i agree with his concern and i will definitely include this topic in my next edition of mann ki baat'
p1822
aS'i will discuss the topic of drugs drug addiction and drug mafia and how they are a threat to our countrys youth'
p1823
aS'if you have some experience any information in this regard if you have ever rescued any child from this drug addiction if you know of any ways and means to help if any government official has played a good role if you give me any such information i will convey such efforts to the public and together we will try to create an environment in each family that no child ever thinks of choosing this vice out of sheer frustration'
p1824
aS'i will definitely discuss this in detail in the next edition'
p1825
aS'i know i am choosing those topics which put the government in the dock'
p1826
aS'but how long will we keep these things hiding'
p1827
aS'how long will we brush these important concerns under the carpet'
p1828
aS'some day or the other we need to take a call follow our instincts and for grand intentions tough calls are equally important'
p1829
aS'i am mustering the courage to do so because your love inspires me to do so'
p1830
aS'and i will continue to do such things because of your love'
p1831
aS'some people told me modi ji you asked us to send you suggestions on facebook twitter or email'
p1832
aS'but a large section of the social class does not have access to these facilities so what can they do'
p1833
aS'your point is very valid'
p1834
aS'everyone does not have this facility'
p1835
aS'well then if you have something to say related to mann ki baat that you hear on the radio even in the villages then do write into me on the following addressmann ki baatakashvanisansad margnew delhi'
p1836
aS'even if you send some suggestions through letters they will definitely reach me'
p1837
aS'and i will take them seriously as active citizens are the biggest asset for development'
p1838
aS'you write one letter it indicates that you are very active'
p1839
aS'when you give your opinion it means that you are concerned with national issues and this is strength of the nation'
p1840
aS'i welcome you'
p1841
aS'for my mann ki baat your mann ki baat sould also reach me'

p1845
aS'so i am getting closer to you'
p1846
aS'the weather is changing'
p1847
aS'winters are slowly setting in'
p1848
aS'this is a good month for health'
p1849
aS'some find it a good season for eating'
p1850
aS'some find it good for wearing nice clothes'
p1851
aS'besides food and clothes it is a good season for health'
p1852
aS'dont let it go waste'
p1853
aS'make the most of it'
p1854
aS'thank you'
p1855
aS'minister from up government sri ahmad hussain ji the local representative from the area sri surendra singh ji our mlc sri kedar nath singh ji respected sister durga devi ji sri arvind ji and my dear brothers and sisters who have gathered here in large numbers'
p1856
aS'the government of india has envisioned a new programme - the saansad aadarsh graam project'
p1857
aS'i being a parliamentarian need to take responsibility of a village under this plan too'
p1858
aS'i have been reading different versions in the newspapers about my decision to adopt jayapur village for this plan'
p1859
aS'each one gives some version and this baffles me'
p1860
aS'i am surprised at how some fertile brains are working to spread stories about my decision to adopt this specific village'
p1861
aS'such reasons given are ones that even i am not aware of'
p1862
aS'why i chose this village has a very simple reason and the reason is that when bhartiya janta party chose me to contest elections from banaras that time a big tragedy occurred where 5 people lost their lives in a fire in jayapur'
p1863
aS'the first ever name that i became aware of after being selected for the banaras constituency was that of jayapur'
p1864
aS'that too i heard in a moment of crisis'
p1865
aS'though i was neither the mp nor we had a government here i called up the government officials i called up my party workers and asked them to reach here for help'
p1866
aS'so this is the reason jayapur occupied a place in my mind and my heart'
p1867
aS'so our relationship started in a moment of crisis and those relationships that spring from crisis often last a lifetime'
p1868
aS'so this is the reason for my association with jayapur'
p1869
aS'i consider this as a fortunate association'
p1870
aS'rest all the stories being spread are false and they have no basis'
p1871
aS'none that i am aware of'
p1872
aS'now some people are writing that the prime minster is adopting a village'
p1873
aS'well this scheme is such where it is the other way round i'
p1874
aS'e'
p1875
aS'the villages are adopting a parliamentarian'
p1876
aS'whatever position we may hold either that of minister chief minister or even a prime minister nothing can be compared to the learning that we can receive from the villagers'
p1877
aS'if i intend to become a good peoples representative if as a public representative i want to understand people and their problems learn something worthwhile then i can not do so by sitting with clerks and officers'
p1878
aS'i can gather this knowledge only by interactions with the learned and experienced people of the village'
p1879
aS'they might not have been to school or had college education but what they have is a vast store of knowledge and experience'
p1880
aS'they have such a vast body of experience that they know practical ways of resolving issues which can be a great learning experience for the public representative'
p1881
aS'this is why i have chosen jayapur and i request you to adopt me in return and teach me ways to resolve your issues'
p1882
aS'even after so many years of independence our villages remained where they were then'
p1883
aS'why so'
p1884
aS'it is now your turn to say that for the past 60 years you sat in your offices at lucknow and delhi and made endless policies and spent millions to no avail'
p1885
aS'now listen to us and do what we think is better for us'
p1886
aS'i am also witnessing that the villages are competing to be adopted for this scheme'
p1887
aS'they are expecting the parliamentarian to choose their village for adoption'
p1888
aS'the reason for this is a misconception among the villagers that if the parliamentarian adopts their village a lot of money is going to flow in'
p1889
aS'well this scheme has no money'
p1890
aS'this scheme does not involve money for if there is money and then there will definitely be a corrupt person to pocket that money'
p1891
aS'the reason for launching this scheme was that despite running several schemes and spending lots of money there was no change in lives of the villagers'
p1892
aS'the idea of this scheme is to find answers to these very questions'
p1893
aS'a few days back i invited the senior bureaucrats for tea during diwali'
p1894
aS'these are those top notch officials who practically run the country'
p1895
aS'all of them are so highly placed that a common citizen can not possibly approach them'
p1896
aS'i called them and gave them a job'
p1897
aS'i asked them to visit the place of their first posting'
p1898
aS'that very place where they must have been posted for around a year where they started their careers and received their initial training'
p1899
aS'i asked them to revisit those places with their children and families'
p1900
aS'tell them how you started as a fresher how you functioned out of your first office and try and remember those people who helped you'
p1901
aS'take your families to meet your acquaintances there'
p1902
aS'i asked them to spend at least three days in that very same location'
p1903
aS'and think how far they have reached in these 30-40 years whereas the village you started in remained where it was'
p1904
aS'go and see for yourself and show the same to your family also'
p1905
aS'i want to create sensitivity something that invokes some kind of proactive thought where they think that it is their responsibility to bring to the forefront all those who supported them when they were new'
p1906
aS'the public representatives need to think to bring development to all those who have been instrumental in bringing them onto the national political scene'
p1907
aS'hence it is my vision to go among these very people work along with them and see that the government policies designed for them are fully implemented'
p1908
aS'see if there is the desired change in the village'
p1909
aS'if there is a difficulty in launching these programmes then whatever policy level changes need to be made can be decided'
p1910
aS'if the mp is successful in achieving this then the entire machinery of the government will get accustomed to working for people'
p1911
aS'i want to create an environment where the residents of jayapur feel empowered about taking a decision for their well being'
p1912
aS'i have been seeing that jayapur is in limelight these days a lot'
p1913
aS'many government officials have visited the place'
p1914
aS'the village was cleaned roads repaired'
p1915
aS'on asking why these special efforts are being made it was the preparation for modi jis visit'
p1916
aS'the villagers held the view that if modi ji visits the village frequently it will become very clean'
p1917
aS'are you correct in thinking this way'
p1918
aS'now that the village has been cleaned i would appreciate that you take a call that now all of us work together to keep the village clean'
p1919
aS'isnt this the beginning of an ideal village'
p1920
aS'i want you to think about the oldest tree in the village'
p1921
aS'have you ever spared it a thought'
p1922
aS'has the village school master ever thought of taking his students to that tree and tell them about its age that it is some 150-200 years old that generations from grandparents to parents to these children have played under this tree'
p1923
aS'this will foster a bonding with that tree'
p1924
aS'today no village might know about its oldest tree'
p1925
aS'why is this so'
p1926
aS'are we no longer fond of them'
p1927
aS'do we think about the elders of the village how many are above 100 years of age how many are above 75 years or more'
p1928
aS'how many children of the village sit with these elders and talk about the old days about the childhood of their elders'
p1929
aS'how was their school how were their teachers what were the food habits at that time how did they cope with the changing seasons'
p1930
aS'have you ever tried this'
p1931
aS'sadly the closed and family like environment so common in a village scenario has suddenly started shrinking'
p1932
aS'can we work together to bring back this environment'
p1933
aS'let me ask you'
p1934
aS'do you know the day when your village was established'
p1935
aS'there must be a day when this village came into existence'
p1936
aS'if you do not know then go to the government offices and find out when this village found existence in government records'
p1937
aS'if no record exists then decide upon a day which would be celebrated as the day when this village was born like we celebrate our birthday'
p1938
aS'all those who have left the village in order to earn their living will also come back that day'
p1939
aS'all the senior people of the village who have attained 75 80 or 90 years should be honoured'
p1940
aS'tell me on such a day will you not clean the village'
p1941
aS'will there be change in the mindsets or not'
p1942
aS'if someone from the village has gone out and one day if he returns on finding the school fan missing he will donate one'
p1943
aS'how do we make our village an ideal one not with the help of the government but by awakening the collective strength of the society'
p1944
aS'we will decide that no child in the village would eat without first washing their hands'
p1945
aS'tell me do we need the government for this kind of a job'
p1946
aS'i was reading a report about a neighboring country where 40 out of 100 children die because of diseases related to not washing hands'
p1947
aS'means 40 children out of hundred died because they did not wash hands'
p1948
aS'how much do we love our children'
p1949
aS'if the kids fall sick everyone feels sad'
p1950
aS'so let us all decide that no child from this village will ever eat anything without first washing his hands'
p1951
aS'you will not expect a prime minister to be talking about these issues'
p1952
aS'there must be some mistake'
p1953
aS'well our leaders in the past were so accustomed of talking tall that it never changed the ground realities'
p1954
aS'i am not here to talk big'
p1955
aS'i have to achieve a larger goal by these small targets'
p1956
aS'i want to ask the people of this village some must have passed 10th some must have passed 12th grade some might be graduates people of different age groups like 50 or 60 years old- have you ever been to the school where your child goes to study'
p1957
aS'have you seen the school'
p1958
aS'do you check if the teacher comes or not'
p1959
aS'is the drinking water clean or dirty if there is a toilet or a library in the school if the computers in the school are in a working condition or not'
p1960
aS'have we ever taken an interest in these issues'
p1961
aS'what we have done is admitted our children in school dumped our child there at the mercy of the teacher and left him to his fate'
p1962
aS'this attitude doesnt work'
p1963
aS'we have to be more proactive'
p1964
aS'we can decide to make a committee of the members of one neighborhood who will go each day and supervise the functioning of the school'
p1965
aS'tell me then our school however small it might be will truly turn into a temple of learning or not'
p1966
aS'it is such an easy job'
p1967
aS'i often tell the poor families in the villages to celebrate the birth of the girl child'
p1968
aS'but do we really celebrate the birth of a girl'
p1969
aS'some families often end up feeling sad if a girl child is born'
p1970
aS'the daughter in law of the household has to face everybodys ire'
p1971
aS'will our jayapur village celebrate the birth of a girl child'
p1972
aS'the goddess of wealth enters our household so this should be celebrated or not should we not be equally proud of our daughters'
p1973
aS'see how few girls are being born in comparison to the number of boys'
p1974
aS'the reason of this is that the daughters are killed in the womb itself'
p1975
aS'if we kill the girl child in the womb itself so how will the social cycle function'
p1976
aS'if 1000 boys are born and only 800 girls are there 200 boys will remain unmarried'
p1977
aS'what then will happen to our villages our society'
p1978
aS'and is this the job of the government'
p1979
aS'isnt this our responsibility as a society to protect and honour our women'
p1980
aS'that is why i am here today in jayapur'
p1981
aS'we have decided whatever we were doing is past now we have to think of a new way forward'
p1982
aS'i even say this that if you have a farm or a small piece of land sow five plants when your daughter is born to celebrate the occasion'
p1983
aS'the girl will grow up and so will the trees'
p1984
aS'when she is old enough to get married sell those trees and you will get the money to marry her off'
p1985
aS'we have to work together to develop new social structure'
p1986
aS'when the village celebrates its inception day there will be no room for casteism'
p1987
aS'all will live in unity casteism will not survive and once free of this social ill no one can stop you from being a force so strong beyond everyones imagination'
p1988
aS'hence this entire aadarsh gram yojana involves implementing government schemes properly on time and effectively'
p1989
aS'we have to implement it in a fashion that optimum results are obtained'
p1990
aS'the mp will provide necessary guidance and the work will gather momentum'
p1991
aS'once the government officers realize how the work is to be done in the village others too will follow soon'
p1992
aS'i have an intense desire to do many things for this village and the district of banaras which are now under my responsibility'
p1993
aS'but i do not intend to work in the usual format of the governmental set up utilizing the funds of the government treasury'
p1994
aS'i want to use the peoples power by encouraging peoples participation'
p1995
aS'a while back our village pradhan durga devi ji was giving her speech'
p1996
aS'i asked her about her qualification'
p1997
aS'she informed that she had studied till the eighth standard'
p1998
aS'now see how high was her confidence level because of her education'
p1999
aS'i felt proud i was truly impressed by the manner in which she expressed her views'
p2000
aS'dont we want our daughters to be educated'
p2001
aS'if our pradhan is educated so shall be all the daughters of this village'
p2002
aS'why is it so that even for taking polio drops someone from the government office has to come to call us'
p2003
aS'shouldnt the youth of the village take the responsibility to see that all children receive polio drops that no child should be inflicted by polio that there is no one who is handicapped'
p2004
aS'the government can bring you the polio drops but it is your responsibility to see that the children receive it'
p2005
aS'so we will take this responsibility wont we'
p2006
aS'i have spent time with you interacted with party workers and officials to understand your problems'
p2007
aS'i am confident that people in the administration which is primarily being run by the state government will see to it that the tasks are undertaken and duly taken to their culmination'
p2008
aS'what the government needs to do and what as villagers we need to do we will decide now'
p2009
aS'and i repeat the mp will not adopt the village rather the village has to adopt the mp'
p2010
aS'we have to work in a new direction and create an ideal village'
p2011
aS'i am grateful to the people of jayapur'
p2012
aS'naturally if i have made inquiries about the works being done the organizational functioning then i will try to find new ways too'
p2013
aS'but i do not wish to discuss this on the stage here'
p2014
aS'i will raise these issues at the necessary forums'
p2015
aS'at the same time i expect you people to sit together and decide what works you can undertake and to work on your own collective strengths'
p2016
aS'i have heard that there is a water crisis in this village'
p2017
aS'the government will do what it needs to do'
p2018
aS'but let us decide that we will not allow even a single drop of rainwater to go waste'
p2019
aS'there will no longer be water crisis'
p2020
aS'but all of us have to work together for this'
p2021
aS'whatever we have been doing is past'
p2022
aS'now we have to think of a new way forward'
p2023
aS'we have to march ahead with our social strength'
p2024
aS'we will no longer wait for the government to do something for us'
p2025
aS'we will work together as a force and involve our neighbouring villages too'
p2026
aS'i have seen this happening in some villages'
p2027
aS'the people have done it and so will jayapur do it'
p2028
aS'i express my gratitude for the love and respect showered by you and i want to assure you that we will work together as a team to create a new jayapur a better jayapur'
p2029
aS'with this belief in my heart i express my sincere gratitude to you all'
p2030
aS'thank you'
p2031
aS'today i have started the programme of cleaning the ghats'
p2032
aS'the social organizations of this place have assured me that the ghat will be cleaned within a month'
p2033
aS'after many years i understand that this gift of cleanliness would be a unique one'
p2034
aS'today i have started and carried forward this task of cleaning the ghats in my constituency of varanasi'
p2035
aS'i will nominate 9 people'
p2036
aS'as per our programme after cleaning the ghats each person will nominate nine other persons'
p2037
aS'when i started the cleanliness drive in delhi i had nominated nine people'
p2038
aS'today again i will nominate nine people specially associated with uttar pradesh'
p2039
aS'one is the chief minister of up shri akhilesh ji yadav'
p2040
aS'the chancellor of the handicapped university in chitrakoot jagat guru swami rambhadracharya ji'
p2041
aS'one of the famous bhojpuri singer and also our mp from bjp who is also associated with this place shri manoj tiwari ji'
p2042
aS'the one to earn his place in the literary world by writing the biography of lord krishna respected manu sharma ji'
p2043
aS'cricketer and an inspiration for the youth shri mohammad kaif'
p2044
aS'padmashree awardee and renowned sanskrit scholar guru devi prasad dwivedi ji'
p2045
aS'a gift from up who has created a name for himself by his comedies sri raju srivastava ji'
p2046
aS'the present cricketing icon of the new generation sri suresh raina ji'
p2047
aS'renowned singer with a distinct identity for his music and a son of meerut a singer well acclaimed sri kailash kher ji'
p2048
aS'i have nominated these nine people'
p2049
aS'i request them to take this cleanliness drive forward and they also nominate nine people under them and take this cycle ahead'
p2050
aS'thank you very much to you all'
p2051
aS'my colleague and cabinet minister dr'
p2052
aS'harshvardhan ji all the respected members sharing the stage and gathering dedicated to ayurveda'
p2053
aS'it was being announced that a brainstorm-churning has happened here for three days and elixir of life has been found'
p2054
aS'so i have also come to take this elixir so that few drops would come in my fate and i dont know whether i would get it a full pitcher or not'
p2055
aS'this time the theme is something like health challenges and ayurveda'
p2056
aS'isnt it'
p2057
aS'you must have discussed on a variety of points but to me the biggest challenges are we the people attached to ayurveda'
p2058
aS'it is hard to find ayurveda-doctor who is 100 dedicated to it'
p2059
aS'even they realise that they cant make it through this path and that they have to take the path to allopathy'
p2060
aS'so they ask patients to start with allopathic medicines for first three days and ayuvedic treatment can be taken care of in successive stages'
p2061
aS'i feel this mentality is the extraordinary challenge against ayurveda'
p2062
aS'if these persons practising ayurveda would not be committed devoted and confident then how those patients would trust them'
p2063
aS'when i was a kid there was a joke in circulation that a traveller went to a city'
p2064
aS'he visited a restaurant and asked to see the owner'
p2065
aS'he was told that the owner has gone to take a meal in a restaurant across the road'
p2066
aS'now think who would like to eat in such restaurant'
p2067
aS'they cant win the trust of others who dont believe in themselves and their traditions'
p2068
aS'crisis is not of the ayurveda but its practitioners'
p2069
aS'i dont know how do you take this discussion in a pleasant or bitter way'
p2070
aS'but if it is bitter then i think that i am referring the matter exactly according to the norms of ayurveda because in ayurveda what tastes bitter at first turns sweet ultimately'
p2071
aS'i have been meeting many people and talking to them'
p2072
aS'last time when i was chief minister of gujarat i had called meeting of specialists of ayurveda'
p2073
aS'this was not my domain at that time and i was working within state of gujarat but there was a need of awareness about ayurveda'
p2074
aS'ayurveda is not a field to be limited to a certified doctor'
p2075
aS'our ancestors have made health a part of our life'
p2076
aS'today we have outsourced our health and lifestyle'
p2077
aS'those days health was not outsourced'
p2078
aS'it was part of lifestyle and due to that every person every family was aware about wellness of body'
p2079
aS'if any problem would pop up then what could be possible solutions people were conscious about that too'
p2080
aS'even today you must be feeling that experience'
p2081
aS'at times when you are travelling in a train or bus and suppose a baby is crying a lot you must have observed that 12-15 persons would come there and they would provide a variety of suggestive measures'
p2082
aS'one would say to give a dose of something another would suggest some different dosage and third would even take out some packet asking to give a dose of that'
p2083
aS'we dont even ask who that person was whether he was a doctor or not'
p2084
aS'but when he assures us we believe him that by giving that dose would bring relief to her as the baby is in pain and crying and he might have a solution to this'
p2085
aS'we see these very often in course of our journey in a train or bus that if a co-passenger falls sick then one or other passenger would come over and treat him even when he or she is not a designated doctor or specialist in ayurveda nor a graduate in ayurveda from jamnagar university'
p2086
aS'but because this has been a natural practise in india and a habit incubated under traditions we have some knowledge of it'
p2087
aS'gradually we outsourced the complete health sector'
p2088
aS'if any medical problem crops up we have to take advice and consultation and we have to go according to prescription'
p2089
aS'if that treatment is successful then it alright otherwise we go to other practitionerwe change the consultancy'
p2090
aS'the first and only necessity for the solution of this problem is that we should not compromise our core sector let me be a student of ayurveda a teacher of ayurveda or engaged in manufacturing of ayurveda medicine or a promoter of holistic healthcare'
p2091
aS'we should be 100 committed to what we do only then we will start seeing the results'
p2092
aS'some negative circumstances have been encountered due to which tired and desperate people are traversing back to the basics in the name of holistic health care'
p2093
aS'they are feeling that modern era medical science might give instant relief but it doesnt guarantee a healthy body as a whole'
p2094
aS'if at all we want the assurances of health we would have to choose holistic approach'
p2095
aS'be it naturopathy ayurveda strict diet-control method or homeopathy there is always a way in that direction and perhaps that is why ayurveda is known to us as panchamveda'
p2096
aS'it has been valued and nurtured as such'
p2097
aS'there is not a part from the root to the fruit of a tree in nature which doesnt find a valuable position in ayurveda'
p2098
aS'from the root to the fruit is a great deal and it means our ancestors must have had a microscopic study of attributes its nature its utility in practice'
p2099
aS'and after all those extraneous work they would have reached the miraculous position'
p2100
aS'how do we keep that great resource in modern times is the second challenge to us'
p2101
aS'it is not possible for us to wait for this world to learn sanskrit language and then accept the preparative'
p2102
aS'but the least we could do is to translate the exalted resource in the language this world understands'
p2103
aS'so the workforce engaged in this industry should be motivated to do the research in the area with a time limit under an institutional framework and present all the research works'
p2104
aS'third point is regarding research articles published in science magazines all over the world'
p2105
aS'cant we altogether launch a movement and try to put some pressure and also encourage people involved in this sector to publish a research article in every ayurvedic sessionmake them a part of curriculum'
p2106
aS'one should be made to write an essay or article in modern terminologies with a profound study on a subject for once at the interval of every two year if he or she is a professor and in case of a student in the final year of their education'
p2107
aS'and it should be published in international magazines or we should better say that 10 of all the space in the magazines of international medicine should be dedicated to ayurveda'
p2108
aS'we would have our research articles at par though differently'
p2109
aS'if we could find a place for our research articles in at international forum then world working on medical science would notice it'
p2110
aS'if we would dedicate 20 of our work and 20 of spaces would be dedicated to ayurvedic research articles then the world reading modern medical science would notice it eventually and may be this would change the perspective of modern medical scientists in a positive way'
p2111
aS'i feel this might crystallize into a new stimulant to give new directions to ayurveda'
p2112
aS'but for this there should be a proper follow-up and identification of medical science magazines available globally'
p2113
aS'we also need to find out if among all those magazines whether or not ayurveda has a place'
p2114
aS'and if ayurveda is to given some space right there then someone would have to discuss this and keep following it up with the concerned'
p2115
aS'in a sense we have to launch a movement that where there is a global acceptance how we carve a niche for us there'
p2116
aS'till a matter doesnt reach to us via america we dont usually accept the same and its become a human tendency and in particular a feature of our fellow countrymen after 1200 yearlong slavery it has penetrated deep into our veins'
p2117
aS'so if an article is published in an international magazine then rest assured that the ayurvedic doctor would adorn his drawing room wall with his photo frame'
p2118
aS'i dont know if people associated with ayurveda have studied these or not'
p2119
aS'when pundit nehru was the prime minister then these matters were dealt with differently in those social conditions'
p2120
aS'government then looked for an approach to promote ayurveda on grounds that why such a massive stream of ours is getting destroyed'
p2121
aS'then a hathi commission was constituted'
p2122
aS'there was a cabinet minister named jai sukhlal hathi and commission was assigned a task to come up with suggestive measures to rejuvenate and promote ayurveda'
p2123
aS'its perhaps a report of year 1960 and quite a marvellous one'
p2124
aS'in that report there is an interesting suggestion on the first page itself'
p2125
aS'in that its been said that there is a need to change the packaging because that packetall those herbs is to be taken a bag fullget the same boiled re-boil with two litres of water and the next time it is to be halvedthen keep it overnightboil again to reduce it to half'
p2126
aS'these practises were not swallowed by common people'
p2127
aS'he further writes that it needs to be packaged as such that common people find it easy to use'
p2128
aS'gradually there has been some change'
p2129
aS'today people opting ayurvedic medicine dont face such challenges of taking the herbs back home boiling them and then make use of it'
p2130
aS'now they find it readymade in medicinal forms in tablet forms and likewise'
p2131
aS'that mean these are available in all the forms at par with an allopathic medicine'
p2132
aS'we are in need of such developmental changes'
p2133
aS'so there should be joint efforts in a year to two consisting of researchers students and manufacturers in ayurvedic field and not for doctors to prescribe the medicine manufactured for some specific company'
p2134
aS'please understand the point i am referring to and inculcate it'
p2135
aS'it should be ensure how the production of medicine can be improved'
p2136
aS'likewise whether the herbs we have studied in vedic texts are available and this is a field of intense research'
p2137
aS'there would be many medicines written in vedic texts that would prescribe a root of a specific tree or plant to be used for medicinal purposes'
p2138
aS'today it would seem difficult to find those trees and plants if searched in accordance with the description illustrated in those texts'
p2139
aS'i have this experience because when i was the chief minister of gujarat i had ordered to construct a teerthankar-forest for all the 24 teerthankars as they got their enlightenment under some or other tree'
p2140
aS'so i thought constructing a teerthankar-forest and plant those 24 trees right there in that forest'
p2141
aS'when i started searching for the trees i was shocked'
p2142
aS'i went as far as indonesia to find those trees but couldnt find them all'
p2143
aS'it means one of the biggest challenges before us is the basic of ayurveda which is herbal plantation'
p2144
aS'how do we proceed in that direction and how do we plan a movement in that field'
p2145
aS'if you get an opportunity to visit bhavnagar then also visit palitana jain shrine'
p2146
aS'there we have built a pavak-van back then when i was in gujarat'
p2147
aS'its situated at the base right before the elevation of palitana'
p2148
aS'that garden landscape is built in shape of a human body'
p2149
aS'its extent is vast enough almost 200 meters in length'
p2150
aS'relevant plants and trees have been planted in accordance to the parts of human body which is treated by that particular type of herb'
p2151
aS'if its the heart then the trees related to the cure of heart diseases have been planted there'
p2152
aS'if its the problem and pains related to knee then herbal plants and trees related to the cure has been planted at the place of knee in the garden'
p2153
aS'if a person visits that garden he would easily identify the relevant herb and that the medicament from that very herb would help me in cure of a disease related to this very part of my body'
p2154
aS'the purpose to be fulfilled is an easy behaviour to describe an ancient knowledge in modern perspectives'
p2155
aS'later when students tour the places they also learn about the particulars of diseases and its curative medicinal plants'
p2156
aS'if we see the things around us we learn faster'
p2157
aS'according to our shastras also india is a country where crore of god-forms have been excogitated and here we have devotee for each type of god'
p2158
aS'if the devotee is a wrestler then the god is hanuman and if the devout are adorer of money then the goddess is lakshmi'
p2159
aS'if the devotee is interested in knowledge then the goddess is saraswati'
p2160
aS'so here the state of affairs is as many gods as the number of devotees'
p2161
aS'so lets keep one thing in mind the number of god being worshipped in our country each one of them has a tree associated'
p2162
aS'observe how marvellous the environment friendly society was and the imagination of such environment friendly society'
p2163
aS'there is no form of the god which is not associated with a tree or plant and a bird or animalwe dont have any god as such'
p2164
aS'these were the ways to broadcast the knowledge with ease'
p2165
aS'on these ways only ayurveda was a part of common people'
p2166
aS'we can change the things around if we have devotion like that'
p2167
aS'thats why people trust ayurveda however educated they are and if the body is to be purified internally ayurveda is the best way to go'
p2168
aS'this is a perception amongst almost everyone'
p2169
aS'they accept that if internal cleansing is to be done then take a shelter of ayurveda and it would be achieved quickly'
p2170
aS'but many a times ayurveda is mocked also'
p2171
aS'once a guest was invited in a family of ayurveda practitioner'
p2172
aS'the lady of the house asked her husband to bring some vegetables from the market place for the guest'
p2173
aS'the practitioner husband went to market to buy vegetables'
p2174
aS'he returned with leaves of neem tree'
p2175
aS'when the wife asked reasons he said that he had gone to market'
p2176
aS'when he saw potatoes he thought of illness related to the consumption of same'
p2177
aS'he saw brinjals again he realised some diseases related to them'
p2178
aS'then he realised he is not looking at vegetables but the diseases themselves all around'
p2179
aS'and at last he returned with neem leaves'
p2180
aS'so at times we have to search a practical application of knowledge'
p2181
aS'if there is no practical approach to the knowledge it gets ditched in the interstices of time'
p2182
aS'that is the reason that the focal area for us should be to develop an accepted and easy norm'
p2183
aS'i acknowledge that a great deal of time has passed around the world and since last 50 years allopathy has captured the medicinal world'
p2184
aS'but people frustrated with allopathy have turned towards holistic health care'
p2185
aS'all the institutions of the world are talking about food grain repertory and health funds and medical science is seeing itself in a new form'
p2186
aS'we have this inheritance'
p2187
aS'but it is important to see this inheritance in modern perspective'
p2188
aS'if a change is required then we ought to change it'
p2189
aS'and if we can achieve this then we would respond aptly to the challenges posed to us which could develop the trust factor in people'
p2190
aS'lifestyle has been associated with ayurveda'
p2191
aS'in many ways ayurveda is connected to a way of life'
p2192
aS'perhaps we never thought of this'
p2193
aS'today few people sitting around here are clapping also'
p2194
aS'at the back there are many students'
p2195
aS'their mind must be deliberating how will i make my career how these small packets of herbs would help me going around with my professional life'
p2196
aS'this must be dwelling in their minds'
p2197
aS'after they go back from this discussion then also this confusion wont fade away given that now we could not become a doctor but becoming a vaidyaraj- an ayurveda practitioner'
p2198
aS'but something needs be done to run a life'
p2199
aS'in spite of that i would suggest that there is no reason for them to be disheartened'
p2200
aS'i am saying this especially to this new generation'
p2201
aS'we have examples and we can learn from those examples'
p2202
aS'even in our country which is the genesis of yoga the india which imparted knowledge of yoga to the world we had assumed that yoga is no more of our use'
p2203
aS'this is a project for sages in caves of the himalayas who sit and meditate'
p2204
aS'and in a way common people kept themselves aloof from it'
p2205
aS'does anyone imagine that how yoga has become a point of central discussion all over the world keeping in mind the state of yoga 30 years back'
p2206
aS'what is the reason that big multinational companies have a space for a stress management institute in their company in the same way as keep ceos'
p2207
aS'why'
p2208
aS'the moments of crisis brought about by reasons of frustration and depression leads a person to search a way for an eternal peace and for them yoga comes as a relieveras a rescue'
p2209
aS'i have tried so many ways i tried even drugs but could find any satisfaction'
p2210
aS'now if i traverse back to this path i would find the specific'
p2211
aS'even though we had detached ourselves from the yoga the world now is connected to it then the ayurveda to which we are acting indifferent today may be tomorrow the world would get connected to it too'
p2212
aS'we have a live example here'
p2213
aS'we can sprout the faith in common man about ayurveda only after we have confidence of this stature'
p2214
aS'so if we try for this and i am confident it would certainly be helpful'
p2215
aS'even today the exported herbal medicines are prescribed all over the world as additional food supplements due to hindrance in the laws of herbal medicines'
p2216
aS'it is sent in the name of additional food supplements'
p2217
aS'it has not been accepted as a prescribed medicinal form'
p2218
aS'do you know the powers of these pharmaceutical companies'
p2219
aS'they would not let you enter so easily in the market'
p2220
aS'they would not provide certification of global acceptance norms for these medicines'
p2221
aS'the challenge is arduous but if common man starts to believe in it then nobody can stop you however huge the organization is'
p2222
aS'i am looking at yet another problem'
p2223
aS'blessed be ayurveda and it should do well'
p2224
aS'but what is is we have created a contrasting relationship between ayurveda and allopathy'
p2225
aS'such is our complete terminology and these terminologies need to be changed'
p2226
aS'even we argue that ayurveda is what cures a disease from its root allopathy provides only superficial relief and we follow the same'
p2227
aS'we say that allopathy is a path whereas ayurveda is a lifestyle'
p2228
aS'we should focus on changing the emphasis of ayurveda'
p2229
aS'it would not be beneficial for us if we take a contrarian view of allopathyy'
p2230
aS'our benefit is in the fact that as yoga has carved a niche for itself ayurveda too can do so'
p2231
aS'if a new disease comes in picture then allopathy would take care of it'
p2232
aS'but if new disease doesnt show up then only ayurveda can handle that'
p2233
aS'and this is a belief of all common man that this is the solution'
p2234
aS'you see how so ever famous a doctor or surgeon be in case of loose motion at the advent of sprouting of teeth to grandchildren they take the kids to a homeopath doctor'
p2235
aS'he takes the kids for medicines so that when teeth come they dont suffer with loose motion do you agree with me'
p2236
aS'for the wellbeing of their kids they leave their way of treatment'
p2237
aS'this faith is too big a thing'
p2238
aS'i am very well versed with an event'
p2239
aS'there was a doctor named vanikar where i lived in gujarat'
p2240
aS'now he is no more now'
p2241
aS'he was very famous perhaps first m'
p2242
aS's'
p2243
aS'in pathology from gujarat and had studied abroad'
p2244
aS'he used to run a pathology laboratory'
p2245
aS'once in his family relations a kid got severely ill'
p2246
aS'he was infant aged approximately 2-3 months old'
p2247
aS'time passed but there was no sign of improvement'
p2248
aS'he was taken to a vaidyaraj- an ayurveda practitioner'
p2249
aS'whole family was there and many people from pathology world were also present'
p2250
aS'when they got tired of their trials the kid was taken to vaidyaraj'
p2251
aS'i had known that practitioner'
p2252
aS'he examined the kid and asked his wife to bring some sweet halwa'
p2253
aS'then these men requested the vaidyaraj that they had their breakfast so did not want to eat halwa'
p2254
aS'vaidyaraj replied that he was not asking halwa for them but for the kid'
p2255
aS'but the question was that the infant was of 3 months how can he eat halwa'
p2256
aS'but whatever the herbs to be mixed must have been known to the wife so she brought a spoonful halwa and vaidyaraj himself fed the halwa to baby from his fingers'
p2257
aS'almost after half an hour of effort little by little some amount of it was fed'
p2258
aS'within three days the infant started showing improvement'
p2259
aS'these doctors would tell me that we being a big name in the field of allopathyy but we couldnt treat own own grandson'
p2260
aS'this vaidyaraj amazed me by a spoonful of medicinal halwa'
p2261
aS'the moral of this story is there is certainly some power in this knowledge'
p2262
aS'the problem is of our faith'
p2263
aS'once we start believing this strength will multiply four-fold and this world would accept it as a way of life and because of it from health point of view for a healthy society and secondly the biggest advantage is that it is one of the cheapest medicines it is not at all costly'
p2264
aS'nowadays i am engaged in giving speeches at elections and it hurts my throat'
p2265
aS'i receive hundreds of calls suggesting me to take some turmeric'
p2266
aS'now those people dont know what effects does turmeric has'
p2267
aS'but when they know that there is sore throat they know turmeric powder can be taken and i can continue delivering speeches'
p2268
aS'such a simple and easy mechanism had developed in our society we need to revitalise it'
p2269
aS'i understand that in these 2-3 days of discussion many of such points must have caught your attention'
p2270
aS'on that basis formulate a plan'
p2271
aS'i would certainly cooperate in such ambitious projects as the government of india and my support would always be there with you'
p2272
aS'i wish you all a healthy life because doctors need to be healthy to treat patients'
p2273
aS'secondly i request you all to take up ayurveda with sense of devotion only not only on grounds of a profession'
p2274
aS'it is for the wellbeing of a society at large and for a great leap of developmental changes'
p2275
aS'march forward with this faith in you'
p2276
aS'i am blessed to have shared the space with you'
p2277

p2278

p2302
aS'many of you have spoken about the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement'
p2303
aS'it can be a springboard for economic integration and prosperity in the region'
p2304
aS'however we should aim for a balanced agreement which is beneficial to all and is truly comprehensive in nature by equally ambitious agenda with similar timelines for goods and services'
p2305
aS'to deepen our connectivity i am considering establishing with your cooperation a special facility or special purpose vehicle to facilitate project financing and quick implementation'
p2306
aS'however in this age more than physical connectivity we need information highways or i-ways'

aS'that was the vision and aspiration that brought us together as saarc 30 years ago'
p2971
aS'we have travelled a long distance together since then'
p2972
aS'we have an agreement an institution or a framework of cooperation in every field'
p2973
aS'we also have many successes'
p2974
aS'yet when we speak of saarc we usually hear two reactions cynicism and scepticism'
p2975
aS'this sadly is in a region throbbing with the optimism of our youth'
p2976
aS'today less than 5 of the regions global trade takes place between us'
p2977
aS'even at this modest level less than 10 of the regions internal trade takes place under saarc free trade area'
p2978
aS'indian companies are investing billions abroad but less than 1 flow into our region'

p2992
aS'it may not seem a great amount in these times but we are grateful for the opportunity to have made a difference to the lives of a few brothers and sisters in our region'
p2993
aS'each of us has taken our initiatives'
p2994
aS'however as saarc we have failed to move with the speed that our people expect and want'
p2995
aS'some argue that it is because of the regions development gap'
p2996
aS'but that should actually spur us to do more'
p2997
aS'or is it because we are stuck behind the walls of our differences and hesitant to move out of the shadows of the past'
p2998
aS'this wont resolve our differences but will certainly deprive us of opportunities'
p2999
aS'today goods travel from one punjab to the other punjab through delhi mumbai dubai and karachi making the journey eleven times longer and the cost four times more'

aS'i know india has to lead and we will do our part hope each of you will too'
p3005
aS'infrastructure is our regions greatest weakness and its most pressing need'
p3006
aS'when i thought of coming to kathmandu by road it made many officials in india nervous'
p3007
aS'because of the condition of roads at the border'
p3008
aS'infrastructure is my greatest priority in india'
p3009
aS'and i also want to set up a special purpose facility in india to finance infrastructure projects in our region that enhances our connectivity and trade'
p3010
aS'we speak of ease of doing business in india'

p3016
aS'excellencies india has a huge trade surplus with saarc countries'
p3017
aS'i believe that this neither right nor sustainable'
p3018
aS'we will address your concerns and give you a level playing field in india'
p3019
aS'but i encourage you to attract indian investments to produce for the indian market and create jobs for your youth'
p3020
aS'i also look to a future when your companies can easily raise funds in india for investments at home and when we have cross-border industrial corridors so that we can take advantage of the natural synergies and connected lives in our border states'
p3021
aS'i also believe that if we can light up each others towns and villages we can build a brighter tomorrow for our region'
p3022
aS'or face a future when someone looks down at us from space and says that this is worlds darkest corner'

p3040
aS'the dream of a south asian university has become a reality in new delhi'
p3041
aS'but to be truly south asian it must also have partnerships with at least one university in each saarc country'
p3042
aS'excellencies indias gift of a satellite for the saarc region will benefit us all in areas like education telemedicine disaster response resource management weather forecasting and communication'
p3043
aS'we will also host a conference in india for all south asian partners next year to strengthen our collective ability to apply space technology in economic development and governance'
p3044
aS'and we plan to launch our satellite by the saarc day in 2016'
p3045
aS'as neighbours we should also be together in good and bad times'
p3046
aS'indias capability and expertise in disaster management will always be available to south asia'
p3047
aS'equally as we reach out to our indians caught in conflicts and disasters around the world we will also be there for all our south asian citizens'
p3048
aS'excellencies a prosperous saarc needs the strong foundation of a secure south asia'
p3049
aS'if we are sensitive to each others security and the lives of our people we will deepen friendships spur cooperation and advance stability in our region'
p3050
aS'today as we remember the horror of the terror attack in mumbai in 2008 we feel the endless pain of lost lives'

aS'the bonds will flow'
p3057
aS'through saarc or outside it'
p3058
aS'among us all or some of us'
p3059
aS'we can all choose our paths to our destinations'
p3060
aS'but when we join our hands and walk in step the path becomes easier the journey quicker and the destination closer'
p3061
aS'i say this as much to my government and people as i say to you'
p3062
aS'we are meeting in the lap of himalaya which has nurtured us through the ages'
p3063
aS'today it is calling us to act'
p3064
aS'let us work to change cynicism into optimism'
p3065
aS'let us turn south asia of flowering hope into a rich field of peace and prosperity'
p3066
aS'my dear brothers and sisters of guwahati who have gathered here in large numberstoday is an important event in the history of railways'
p3067
aS'one more of the indian states are going to be connected through rail network'
p3068
aS'today a new route from mendipathar in meghalaya to guwahati in assam gets connected by rail'
p3069
aS'also there is yet another occasion for the railways as the foundation for a new rail route from bhairabi to sairang in mizoram will be laid'
p3070
aS'so both these projects where one rail route is being opened up and foundation for another is being laid presents a unique occasion'
p3071
aS'there are those of us who believe in vaastu though i must confess that i do not know much about it'
p3072
aS'but if i were to believe what the experts say then the north east corner of the house should be well kept'
p3073
aS'it should be clean and its sanctity should be maintained at all times'
p3074
aS'if this is done the house will forever prosper'
p3075
aS'well i can not verify these claims but what i do know is that if we are able to take care of the north east india the ishan corner of our homeland then the entire india will prosper'
p3076
aS'so if we want india to prosper the progress of the north east will need to be fast tracked'
p3077
aS'the first step in this direction will be the development of infrastructure'
p3078
aS'those who are futuristic and have a great vision always start with the development of infrastructure'
p3079
aS'once infrastructure is developed then the people themselves take development forward'
p3080
aS'many of you must have heard about south korea'
p3081
aS'it is a small country with a population of about 5-6 crores'
p3082
aS'it is along the sea coast'
p3083
aS'it was a very poor country'
p3084
aS'we talk about the poverty in india but think of a country poorer than india'
p3085
aS'but the rulers there thought of building a highway at par with international standards right in the middle of the country'
p3086
aS'this became a hugely controversial decision'
p3087
aS'people were angry that they had no food the children had no access to education they had no homes to live yet their ruler was thinking of spending hundreds of crores of on construction of a road'
p3088
aS'but their ruler was a man of grit and determination'
p3089
aS'he went ahead with his plans and built the road despite the criticism'
p3090
aS'and that one road changed the face of the entire nation'
p3091
aS'a few years back we too hosted the commonwealth games'
p3092
aS'we are a large country but what did we do'
p3093
aS'whatever happened in delhi the negative publicity and the disgrace that followed is known to one and all'
p3094
aS'that same small country of south korea was able to hold olympics in their country about 12-15 years back and host a worldwide audience'
p3095
aS'that nation prospered and poverty was eradicated'
p3096
aS'and how did they achieve that by just one road that opened the doors of prosperity for them'
p3097
aS'the american president kennedy said it is not wealth that creates roads but it is the roads that lead to the creation of wealth'
p3098
aS'in the plans for development infrastructure occupies a significant place'
p3099
aS'if the north east has to develop and play an important role in the development of india then infrastructure development should be a priority'
p3100
aS'it is my firm belief that these 8 north eastern states our ashta lakshmi eight goddesses of wealth have the potential of bringing in prosperity for the entire nation'
p3101
aS'if these eight states are connected to the nations infrastructure which includes roads rail and all other types of connectivity if we are successful in doing so which i am sure we will then there will be no looking back'
p3102
aS'there is a new higher middle class which takes family vacations once or twice each year'
p3103
aS'they are always scouting for new destinations'
p3104
aS'with better connectivity north east will become the heaven which every tourist desires'
p3105
aS'the beautiful landscapes the dense jungles and above all the warmth of the people here will make it the most sought after destination and i am sure that people from all over india will be thronging the place'
p3106
aS'and with this thought of developing the north east our new government that has been recently formed in its first budget itself allocated a sum of rs'
p3107
aS'28000 crores for the development of rail network in the region'
p3108
aS'i have a firm belief that once this network is laid my people will themselves take this region to new unprecedented heights of progress and development'
p3109
aS'in the changing world scenario it is believed that this century belongs to asia'
p3110
aS'and if this is a century of asia then have we made any preparations'
p3111
aS'there is an emphasis on look east policy'
p3112
aS'we believe that if this century belongs to asia then we are definitely going to make the most of it'
p3113
aS'and how do we intend to achieve it'
p3114
aS'not just by following look east but by following look east act east policy'
p3115
aS'and we are now moving form just look east to act east policy'
p3116
aS'it is our effort that north east gets connected by road and rail to myanmar and other east asian countries'
p3117
aS'if this is achieved this region will become the centre of trade and commerce'
p3118
aS'this region will hold the potential for redefining progress'
p3119
aS'and then the youth of north east will not have to leave their homeland endowed with natural wealth and go elsewhere to big cities in search of livelihood'
p3120
aS'times are changing and so we have to move forward with new concept of infrastructural development'
p3121
aS'the infrastructure too needs to be with ethos of next generation'
p3122
aS'in the past building rail road ports and airports was perceived by the people a lot was done'
p3123
aS'but now the world is changing'
p3124
aS'now highways are required as are i-ways'
p3125
aS'information ways i-ways'
p3126
aS'there is no place for a digital divide'
p3127
aS'north east should be an integral part of the digital india dream'
p3128
aS'it should have both i-ways network and connectivity'
p3129
aS'the facilities should be such that whatever one is able to achieve sitting in delhi same should be available to a person living in the difficult terrains of the north east'
p3130
aS'the world is changing'
p3131
aS'why shouldnt there be gas grid'
p3132
aS'why shouldnt there be access to 24 hours of fresh water supply'
p3133
aS'why shouldnt there be electricity supply round the clock'
p3134
aS'why shouldnt there be an optical fibre network'
p3135
aS'we have to develop infrastructure keeping the new and changing times in mind'
p3136
aS'this concept of next generation infrastructure development for a modern india should be conducted at a fast pace and should be actualized as soon as possible'
p3137
aS'the children of north east are educated in english'
p3138
aS'if there is proper optical fibre coverage and smooth connectivity then the youth of north east can do the same job work from home in their own village as is being done in hyderabad and bangalore'
p3139
aS'they do not need to go to delhi and bombay for call centre jobs'
p3140
aS'this can happen in north east itself'
p3141
aS'this world here can change hence i am taking a special interest in the development of the north east'
p3142
aS'a few days back i had visited myanmar'
p3143
aS'i had discussions with the heads of state regarding improved connectivity improved trade and greater utilization of the local human resource'
p3144
aS'dear brothers and sisters this rail connectivity is not only about passengers commuting from one place to another'
p3145
aS'it is a medium that connects us gives us pace and speed and also provides us strength'
p3146
aS'the indian railways have the potential to become the backbone of all economic activities'
p3147
aS'but instead of considering it as the energetic force of economic development we have made it completely insignificant'
p3148
aS'nobody from the parliament or the nation ever pays attention to the discussions of the railway budget'
p3149
aS'the moment railway minister starts speaking the statements that are greeted with applause are the ones related to increase in number of coaches or extension of some route or upgradation of some station'
p3150
aS'we have divided railways in such small parts'
p3151
aS'we should not be satisfied if a coach is added and applaud it or feel happy if a new route is opened'
p3152
aS'we will not be satisfied with these petty gains'
p3153
aS'we have to both expand railways and also modernize it'
p3154
aS'we are aiming at both horizontal and vertical expansion of the railways'
p3155
aS'by horizontal expansion i mean expanding its reach to every nook and corner of the country'
p3156
aS'by vertical expansion i mean the upgradation of services which involves technology upgradation speed enhancement to save time and enhancement of facilities'
p3157
aS'it will be our endeavour to see that railways truly become an engine facilitating the economic growth of the nation in true sense'
p3158
aS'i have complete faith that under the dynamic leadership of our new rail minister mr suresh prabhu railway will witness many fold progress in comparison to the progress made in the past 100 years'
p3159
aS'for the first time in the countrys history we have made a decision that of 100 foreign direct investment'
p3160
aS'we are looking at 100 foreign investment in the railways'
p3161
aS'people will come invest money create moderns trains create modern rail lines modern signaling system will be implemented modern ticketing system will be put in place the entire railway system will be modernised'
p3162
aS'in a country of 125 million everyone has been a passenger some or the other time'
p3163
aS'some people travel once a year and some people travel many times in the same day but the underlying fact is that everyone travels'
p3164
aS'so you can imagine the large commercial market that exists'
p3165
aS'we can also strive towards making eco friendly and environment friendly railways'
p3166
aS'thus we can play an important role in the fight against global warming arising out of mass transportation'
p3167
aS'there are many facets which we want to involve in the creation of new systems using the railways'
p3168
aS'the entire functioning of the railways involves expertise dedicated technology and continuous technology upgradation and for this human resources are required'
p3169
aS'currently the railways advertise for vacancies and the people apply for jobs'
p3170
aS'those who qualify for the interviews are subsequently trained for the services'
p3171
aS'we have thought of a new version which i am sure the new generation will definitely like'
p3172
aS'i have suggested establishing railway university in four corners of the country'
p3173
aS'it will have all the courses and also courses dedicated to the functioning of railways'
p3174
aS'thus on passing out the youth will immediately find an employment opportunity with the railways'
p3175
aS'human resource development along with technology upgradation improvement in speed and management improvement in facilities and delivery of services - this is our agenda'
p3176
aS'our railway stations which exist right in the heart of big cities extend for miles'
p3177
aS'land today is a major premium'
p3178
aS'but our railway stations continue to be the same as they were a hundred years back'
p3179
aS'same chairs and benches to sit same services to the passengers'
p3180
aS'but cant this all be changed'
p3181
aS'we have asked for the railway stations to be privatised'
p3182
aS'the trains keep running below and above them five star seven star hotels motels or malls can be erected'
p3183
aS'the sky above the train is open so utilize it for income generation and enhance the services delivered at the railway stations- this is what i have explained to them'
p3184
aS'railways have taken a call for the modernisation of some railway platforms'
p3185
aS'i hold the view that railway platform should be better than the airports'
p3186
aS'because railway platform is used by the poorest of poor the common man as well as a labourer hence the services at the railway platform have to change'
p3187
aS'you will see that within no time i will create 10 -12 model stations'
p3188
aS'once this is attained then the entire country will follow and our work will gain momentum'
p3189
aS'brothers and sisters we have to bring about a dramatic change in the railways'
p3190
aS'our endeavour should be to be the best in the world and for that whatever new technology is required we will bring it in'
p3191
aS'by connecting the north east this ashta lakshmi of india by rail we intend to make this region the most prosperous in india'
p3192
aS'we are working in that direction'
p3193
aS'i congratulate the railway officials and give them my best wishes'
p3194
aS'i congratulate the rail ministry and the new rail minister who will take this forward at a great speed'
p3195
aS'i congratulate the people of meghalaya and mizoram'
p3196
aS'i thank the governor and chief minister from all my heart'
p3197
aS'let us all work to take our nation to new heights and our idea of progress should entail development for all no region should be left behind'
p3198
aS'let us move forward with the notion that development touches one and all is inclusive and all encompassing is fulfilling for everyone and extends everywhere'
p3199
aS'in taking this development forward i thank everybody for their contribution'
p3200
aS'i express my gratitude to shri tarun ji'
p3201
aS'thank you'
p3202
aS'my colleague in the council of ministers shri rajnath singh ji all the honourable chief ministers of northeast shri kiran rijiju ji and all the officers and leaders of the police force'
p3203
aS'i heartily congratulate all those who have been honoured today'
p3204
aS'since the times of chanakya we have studied what is vital for nations security more than having advantage of good weaponry it depends on who has those weapons'
p3205
aS'but even more important than having weaponry and trained manpower handling those weaponry is having the best intelligence network as the success of any nations security depends on it'
p3206
aS'the system that has the best form of intelligence will never require either the weapon holder or weaponry and there definitely wont be any need of use of weapons'
p3207
aS'if there is any unit that holds utmost importance in terms of nations security it is the intelligence system'
p3208
aS'i have been privileged enough to honour the officers serving in this arena'
p3209
aS'i would like to once again congratulate them for their excellent service'
p3210
aS'everyone is surprised that the tradition of holding this conference in new delhi since so many years has been discontinued and the ceremony has been shifted from delhi to guwahati'
p3211
aS'but you must have noticed that when you come to delhi for a meeting you come there with a lot of work'
p3212
aS'you feel that since we have come all the way to delhi you might as well get with a few other things done like visit the ministry meet the secretaries'
p3213
aS'but now you need to concentrate a little on the issues faced by the state'
p3214
aS'now the meeting is out of delhi and hence from the time you have come here you must have been well acquainted with each other'
p3215
aS'there is no other activity here so the entire focus will be on the ongoing activity'
p3216
aS'and the one to benefit the most would be the people of northeast the police force here would be very happy and encouraged and this would also help you understand how big result a minor change can bring about'
p3217
aS'it is possible that later in life you also take this initiative'
p3218
aS'this is an auspicious beginning'
p3219
aS'in the future too we want such events to take place outside delhi in different states'
p3220
aS'i am sure delhi will also get a chance it is not that delhi will never host such meets anymore'
p3221
aS'but when the programme is held in delhi there is no role played by the delhi police'
p3222
aS'the indian government and vigyan bhavan are ready with your accommodation where you stay in your quarters and then leave'
p3223
aS'this is a change and every system of change needs to have a life'
p3224
aS'robotic systems do not work'
p3225
aS'systems should be alive and full of life'
p3226
aS'systems should encourage and augment the liveliness and this change will lead you in that direction'
p3227
aS'i am sure you will also adopt similar experiments in your state'
p3228
aS'you have been here since yesterday and there have been talks - some of serious nature and there have been some light conversations'
p3229
aS'even i am going to be with you till today afternoon'
p3230
aS'i want to spend maximum time listening to you'
p3231
aS'but there are a few things that i want to express today'
p3232
aS'after our countrys independence the fact that 33 thousand policemen have sacrificed their lives while protecting the country and safeguarding the comforts of its citizens is by no means a minor feat'
p3233
aS'but does the entire police force know that 33 thousand policemen have sacrificed their lives to protect the country'
p3234
aS'how would then the common citizens of india know about this fact'
p3235
aS'i feel it is of prime importance that this sacrifice does not go waste'
p3236
aS'how can their respect get enhanced in the society'
p3237
aS'he also must have been someones son'
p3238
aS'and he has died in the line of duty and i do not know why we have not shown enough concern towards them'
p3239
aS'i would want a small taskforce to be formed from amongst you consisting of some senior and experienced people'
p3240
aS'we should be able to find out ways to incorporate the positives from the heritage of this sacrifice in a manner such that it is embedded as our inspiration forever'
p3241
aS'a protocol also has to be set up to honour them during their last rites'
p3242
aS'every state has its own police academy where the new recruits are trained'
p3243
aS'i want to know if their syllabus can include a thorough knowledge comprised in a comprehensive book based on the life of all those who have sacrificed their lives from that region'
p3244
aS'every state should have its own book - an official government book'
p3245
aS'who has sacrificed their life at what occasion how did they lose their life in the line of duty what courage did they show and how many lives they did they save all should be mentioned in the book'
p3246
aS'the new generation of police the new constables who are under training will learn these things'
p3247
aS'he will have to read this book too and answer an exam on the same'
p3248
aS'through this he will realise of the martyrdom of those before him who sacrificed their lives'
p3249
aS'this will then be passed on through the generations'
p3250
aS'should we bring out a new edition of the book every year'
p3251
aS'we can decide now that every state publishes an e-book that mentions the martyrdom of all these 33 thousand martyrs with their photos which can be sourced from their families'
p3252
aS'it should be in the regional and national language'
p3253
aS'this will be a small effort but one with huge repercussions in form of the inspiration'
p3254
aS'i have also noticed that the police department holds a lot of programmes for police welfare'
p3255
aS'cine stars are a part of these programmes and performances and plays are also a part of it'
p3256
aS'it is done in a grand way in mumbai'
p3257
aS'during this time a souvenir is also issued'
p3258
aS'advertisement is asked for and funds are collected'
p3259
aS'i have not gone into the details nor do i wish to'
p3260
aS'but can we decide to include a list of those who have sacrificed their lives in that particular year in the souvenir speaking of their deeds'
p3261
aS'we shouldnt let their lives go waste in this manner'
p3262
aS'he may not be physically alive but for the police force and the society he should never die'
p3263
aS'it is our responsibility'
p3264
aS'i dont want to discuss if something similar has happened in the past but something like this should happen now as i believe it will make a huge difference'
p3265
aS'the other thing is police welfare'
p3266
aS'i am well aware that the police force leads a life full of stress'
p3267
aS'he puts his life on the line of fire for his duty'
p3268
aS'if there is no well-being and happiness in his family how will they go on duty'
p3269
aS'no matter how sacrificial and selfless the police officer is familys discomfort also causes him discomfort'
p3270
aS'it is the role of the government and all of us to establish a system for the welfare of their families'
p3271
aS'everything from them and their familys health check up to their childrens education should be taken care of'
p3272
aS'how are the residential facilities of those in the lower ranks'
p3273
aS'someone should pay some heed to this'
p3274
aS'and its not as if this is not happening'
p3275
aS'a good thing now is that our home minister was a successful chief minister of one of the biggest states of our country'
p3276
aS'and hence he knows the nuances of this topic'
p3277
aS'his guidance will be of a lot of help to us in the coming days'
p3278
aS'it has also been my privilege that since i was a chief minister for quite a long time and held the control of the home department i am also aware of the way it functions'
p3279
aS'i am aware of what goes on the ground'
p3280
aS'and hence it might be a possibility that we are treating this on priority'
p3281
aS'we want to approach the task of police welfare in a scientific manner and that is the bare minimum we can do'
p3282
aS'and if we do this then there will be a huge change'
p3283
aS'sometimes the movies depict a policeman in a certain grey light and this goes into the minds of common man'
p3284
aS'i have seen a very few movies that talk about the sacrifice of these policemen and that is the reason such an image of policemen has embedded in the minds of a common man'
p3285
aS'we should make special efforts'
p3286
aS'the indian government should make a pr agency of sorts and meet the film producers and make them aware of their deeds'
p3287
aS'if the opinion-makers of the society wont protect the integrity of the ones who protect our country then the rot in the system will also not go away'
p3288
aS'if there is a kid in the family who keeps committing a mistake we dont reprimand him for every mistake of his and instead try to point out his achievements then he on his own starts focusing on the good and developing on it'
p3289
aS'there will be limitations who doesnt have them'
p3290
aS'but there is a way to overcome these limitations with the help of the society'
p3291
aS'i want the thought process of the country towards the policemen to change keeping the onground realities in mind'
p3292
aS'any negative story about a policeman has a long shelf life in the media but many positive things never even come to the fore'
p3293
aS'when i was in gujarat i had conducted an experiment and you too can try it if you find it to be applicable'
p3294
aS'i dont know what happened after i have left gujarat'
p3295
aS'i dont know if they are still following that or not'
p3296
aS'but i had made a request to every police station to build their own website where they would update their weeks best of the best social activities'
p3297
aS'whatever the weeks positive highlight was whether they worked towards a social cause or helped a needy and treated them with respect saved someone from heavy losses all this would be updated on the website'
p3298
aS'there are a lot of instances there is no dearth of such incidents that can be highlighted'
p3299
aS'please dont be depressed there are a lot of good things happening in the country due to you but if you dont bring them out in the open no one will know about it'
p3300
aS'we put up a positive story that is absolutely true on the website every week and see the kind of changes it brings in peoples perception towards the police'
p3301
aS'there is no need to be artificial there are enough positive things to be highlighted'
p3302
aS'every person you meet will have at least one positive story to tell about a policeman'
p3303
aS'but such facts are not collectively presented to the people'
p3304
aS'i want you to think on this positively and develop a plan of action to take it forward'
p3305
aS'we will discuss this in detail when we meet'
p3306
aS'i have a concept in my mind - that of smart police - a smart police force'
p3307
aS'how can we work with this vision'
p3308
aS'when i talk about smart police i mean s - strict but also s - sensitive police should be strict yet sensitive m modern and there should be mobility there should be no stagnancy a - alert and accountable r - reliable and responsive t - techno savvy and trained'
p3309
aS'we have to take these five points and march ahead'
p3310
aS'i truly believe we can fill the police force with a new life and a renewed sense of consciousness'
p3311
aS'once again i would like to thank and congratulate all those whom i have had the privilege of honouring today'
p3312
aS'in future too the mighty police force will be successful in serving the citizens protecting them and most importantly instilling in them a sense of faith'
p3313
aS'the rest we will discuss in detail when we meet'
p3314
aS'best wishes thank you'
p3315
aS'the chief minister was just speaking on a lot of topics - there are no roads no hospitals and nothing of film division of any sort'
p3316
aS'i felt satisfied to hear him discussing these problems as it made me feel that this chief minister trusts this government to change things'
p3317
aS'and since he has such faith in my government i feel the need to fulfill these wishes'
p3318
aS'the porbandar-silcher road that he mentioned - i had laid the foundation stone of the road in gujarat at porbandar in the capacity of chief minister of the state during the period of atal bihari vajpayee government'
p3319
aS'it is also possible that i come here for a similar inauguration in future'
p3320
aS'but all the subjects that the chief minister has mentioned are important'
p3321
aS'we too are keen on developing north east the land of ashta lakshmi and hence we have allotted a budget of about rs 60000 crores towards the development of its infrastructure'
p3322
aS'during the bilateral talks in myanmar on my recent visit there the maximum impetus was on the subject of how to establish connectivity with imphal'
p3323
aS'be it air connectivity road connectivity or i-ways it should benefit everyone and the government of myanmar has also taken important decisions to get associated with the infrastructure projects with the government of india so that this region can be made more accessible'
p3324
aS'you will surely notice the results in the coming days'
p3325
aS'today i have had the good fortune of being here for the sangai festival'
p3326
aS'our country has a lot of potential for tourism'
p3327
aS'no matter where in the world a tourist goes our one state of india is capable of showcasing more than all that one country can offer the tourist'
p3328
aS'a tourist can easily tour a state for a month and if he keeps visiting our country every year choosing to experience a new state a lifetime wouldnt be enough to see entire india'
p3329
aS'every state of our country has a different highlight such varied is the heritage of our country'
p3330
aS'north east and especially manipur have a lot of opportunities for the development of tourism'
p3331
aS'like the chief minister just pointed out i belong to gujarat'
p3332
aS'krishna is celebrated in dwarka there and i have been brought up in a similar environment worshipping lord krishna'
p3333
aS'when i saw you worshipping lord krishna singing his praises i felt right at home in manipur'
p3334
aS'the world tourism sector has an estimated potential worth 3 trillion dollars'
p3335
aS'if there is any one sector that is growing by leaps and bounds globally it is the tourism sector'
p3336
aS'some places have shown a growth of 40 per cent in this sector'
p3337
aS'india has a lot to offer to the world that can influence and inspire them'
p3338
aS'but this area is still largely untapped'
p3339
aS'it is our constant effort to attract the world through our rich heritage'
p3340
aS'the game of polo was born here'
p3341
aS'there was a polo programme arranged here yesterday in which according to the information i have 8 countries participated'
p3342
aS'this is your heritage'
p3343
aS'i want the world to know about the place that gave birth to polo and hence i will match steps with the state in its efforts to highlight their assets'
p3344
aS'i just met with delegates from the hrd ministry and asked them if there was a possibility of about 100 students from all the universities of the country visit north east as tourists'
p3345
aS'only if university students start visiting the tourism scene of the region will change drastically'
p3346
aS'they have already begun work towards making this a possibility and you should be able to see the results soon'
p3347
aS'and there is such diversity of heritage in manipur'
p3348
aS'there is song dance theatre costumes and what not'
p3349
aS'it is truly reflective in its rich cultural heritage'
p3350
aS'the reason of my joining in the sangai festival is the same'
p3351
aS'i want the world to see what manipur has to offer and when they see the pm visiting they might want to find out what the hoopla is all about'
p3352
aS'there are two theories - one that says if the infrastructure is developed tourism will develop and the other goes if tourism prospers infrastructure will have to develop'
p3353
aS'both theories carry equal weight'
p3354
aS'if tourism prospers the quality of infrastructure will improve which in turn will bring in more visitors'
p3355
aS'these changes take place gradually over a period of time'
p3356
aS'we just need to create a friendly environment'
p3357
aS'if there is good connectivity then there will be a droves of visitors here'
p3358
aS'i firmly believe that tourism is one such sector that gives maximum returns in the minimum investment'
p3359
aS'everyone - from a snack vendor an auto rickshaw driver a florist a vegetable vendor to a cab driver a guest house owner and even those offering the option of home stay and a tea vendor - everyone can benefit from the development of tourism'
p3360
aS'i will be particularly happy if the tea vendor earns well'
p3361
aS'what i mean to say is that even the poorest of poor would benefit from it'
p3362
aS'the government of india has recognised the power of manipur and hence we have decided to establish a sports university here'
p3363
aS'manipur has a huge role to play in indias achievements in sports'
p3364
aS'we want to harness this power to the optimum as this power is inherent in the dna of the people of manipur'
p3365
aS'additionally the people of manipur have a sportsman spirit and we want to set an example for the rest of the country'
p3366
aS'some people think that a sports university only helps in creating good players but that is not the case'
p3367
aS'a sport in itself is a large economy'
p3368
aS'right from making a playground to those who write scoreboards the one involved in collection of data those looking after the players food habits physiotherapy and sportsman costumes - everyone finds employment'
p3369
aS'the youth of manipur who might not have been able to become players but they can train themselves in this university to become an umpire a scorer or become a physiotherapist of a good sportsman or can become dietician of a good sportsman they can also become makers or architects of a playground'
p3370
aS'in a manner opportunities of overall development are associated with a sports university'
p3371
aS'many people might otherwise think that a sports university would mean a place where players would be trained'
p3372
aS'but that is not the case'
p3373
aS'it is a science an economy a complete creation with elements of technology arithmetic and many such elements'
p3374
aS'you can not imagine the amount of changes a university can bring about in manipur'
p3375
aS'when i visited australia recently i have asked them to collaborate with us on the manipur sports university'
p3376
aS'i want to connect the countries of the world with manipur and you will reap the benefits in the coming days'
p3377
aS'the youth of manipur wants job and there is a need for skill development that will eventually lead to jobs'
p3378
aS'i have also asked an it professional that i just met to focus on the possibility of establishing call centers here in cities like manipur nagaland meghalaya mizoram etc'
p3379
aS'instead of in cities like hyderabad and bangalore'
p3380
aS'the weather here would diminish the need of air conditioners thus bringing down the cost hugely'
p3381
aS'the youth here also speak fluent english so the language shouldnt be a barrier'
p3382
aS'i am trying to get this done'
p3383
aS'i will try and pull some companies here due to which there will be a lot of opportunities for the youth here and they wouldnt have to leave manipur in search of better jobs'
p3384
aS'i have also thought of the possibility of employing the youth of manipur in the police force of delhi'
p3385
aS'when the world sees the youth from the north east policing the streets of delhi keeping it safe they will realise the true potential of these states'
p3386
aS'i want to work towards this as well'
p3387
aS'when i was the chief minister of gujarat i had a plan that wasnt put into action'
p3388
aS'i had envisioned a strategy of sort where every state of the north east - 8 of them - will select and send 200 women each to be a part of the police force in gujarat in every two years'
p3389
aS'so a total of 1600 women would have joined the police forces in gujarat'
p3390
aS'imagine the kind of national integration that would be'
p3391
aS'at the same time i had also emphasised how gujaratis were the best tourists in the whole world'
p3392
aS'no matter where you go you will find a gujarati there'
p3393
aS'we like to roam around spending the wealth we have'
p3394
aS'so as per my plan if 1600 girls would stay in gujarat for 2 years they would at least mingle with 15-20 families each who would in return visit their state thus enhancing tourism'
p3395
aS'i have told the chief minister of gujarat to explore the possibility and if anyone from the north east wants to visit gujarat we would welcome them with open arms'
p3396
aS'imagine the benefits these states will reap by associating with a prosperous state like gujarat'
p3397
aS'therefore my brothers and sisters of manipur all the points that have been raised by the chief minister at the closing ceremony of the sangai festival today naturally having faith in me please be assured that i will do my best to keep that faith as i am a man who tries to live up to them'
p3398
aS'i will go back and discuss the issues with the people of the concerned departments and see what can be done about them'
p3399
aS'i will also try to fulfill all the promises i have made here today and put all the plans into action'
p3400
aS'i will also expect that the manner in which manipur has made us proud in the field of sports similarly it becomes the flag bearer in the arena of development'
p3401
aS'however i am deeply concerned by one issue here which i would like to address'
p3402
aS'the youth of manipur are victims of drug abuse and this deeply hurts me'
p3403
aS'my heart goes out to the parents of such youth'
p3404
aS'it is our responsibility to ensure that our future generation does not suffer due to this'
p3405
aS'it is a dangerous path and it is not about an individual but the whole family and eventually the society and the country suffers immensely due to this'
p3406
aS'hence we need to make a collective decision as a society to ensure that we will end this'
p3407
aS'in a land where lord krishna and his miracles are celebrated where we find the countrys best players we will not let manipur suffer from such a disease'
p3408
aS'the youth of manipur have the capability of changing the future of the country'
p3409
aS'drugs destroy everything and today as we have gathered here at the pious occasion of the sangai festival i request the youth of manipur to give up drugs'
p3410
aS'i know it is a difficult addiction to kick but once you decide you will be able to come out of it'
p3411
aS'once you save yourself you and your family will benefit from it and grow'
p3412
aS'with this request i thank the people of manipur for inviting me here and being a part of your celebrations'
p3413
aS'thank you'
p3414
aS'good morning'
p3415
aS'ladies and gentlemen it is a great honour for me to be here amongst the friendly nagas to celebrate the world famous hornbill festival'

p3419
aS'on this auspicious day i urge the nagas that after 50 years of statehood look back'
p3420
aS'introspect'
p3421
aS'and take stock of the ground you have covered so far and what remains to be achieved'
p3422
aS'i have seen the strength of your society today'
p3423
aS'a very rich cultural heritage'
p3424
aS'this must be promoted'
p3425
aS'your culture must not only be interpreted as your colourful dances and songs but the naga culture of sturdiness honesty simplicity reflected in all your deliberations and actions'
p3426
aS'the naga way of life means pride in your inherent strong character and your hard working attitude'
p3427
aS'i also know that you have a rich biodiversity'
p3428
aS'your region is located in one of the 25 hot bio-diversity areas of the world'
p3429
aS'this must be protected at all costs even as your embark on sustainable development of your resources'
p3430
aS'people will come to your state for investment or tourism and they will do so because of your amazing bio-diversity and salubrious climate'
p3431
aS'nagaland is blessed in having a young population well-versed in the english language and in tune with what is happening around the world'
p3432
aS'this is an advantage which must be tapped'
p3433
aS'you must capture the it outsourcing business of the world in this part of the country'
p3434
aS'i also greatly admire the equal position of naga women in the naga society'
p3435
aS'i recall how smartly our young naga women jawaans worked while deployed during the delhi commonwealth games'
p3436
aS'this participation brought great pride to our nation and was a shining example for our womenfolk across the country'
p3437
aS'the contribution of half of our population to the growth of our society is immeasurable'
p3438
aS'nagas are sports-loving people and have the potential to perform well in disciplines such as boxing tae kwon do football and archery'
p3439
aS'i feel that these activities must be promoted in a systematic way to realize the potential of the people of the region given the right direction'
p3440
aS'i know that it has been over a decade since prime minister vajpayee visited nagaland'
p3441
aS'i think nowadays if i want to come to nagaland from delhi or if anyone from here wants to go to delhi it hardly takes 10-15 hours'
p3442
aS'but prime ministers took more than 10 years to reach here'
p3443
aS'i assure the people of nagaland that you will not have to wait this long for the prime minister to visit again'
p3444
aS'i assure you'
p3445
aS'i will be happy to come often to meet the people of nagaland'
p3446
aS'i will come back to see to it that everything that i have mentioned becomes a reality'
p3447

p3448
aS'friends for the last 2-3 days i have been in this part of our country'
p3449
aS'i think it is the first time that an indian prime minister has stayed in the north-east for 3 days'
p3450
aS'in india the word sez is very popular'
p3451
aS'special economic zone'
p3452
aS'but after being here for the last three days i must say that it is not only sez it is nez'
p3453
aS'when i say nez i mean natural economic zone'
p3454
aS'the other parts of india will have to find man-made special economic zones'
p3455
aS'but here natural economic zones already exist'
p3456
aS'but unfortunately they are untapped'
p3457

p3522
aS'now that the saarc nations have agreed i will request bangladesh and i offer to provide electricity to bangladesh if it intends to purchase it'
p3523
aS'we are in that position'
p3524
aS'and i am making this declaration from a place which has shared bangladeshs joys and grief during the period of its freedom movement and creation'

aS'i want to congratulate and thank gem and jewellery export promotion council the ministry of commerce and industry and the world diamond mark for organising this event'
p3670
aS'india is the natural venue for this conference'
p3671
aS'for one it is generally believed that diamond is indias gift to the world'
p3672
aS'more than two thousand years ago diamond was deeply valued in india'
p3673
aS'it was even traded with china over the silk route'
p3674
aS'it was even traded with china over the silk route'
p3675
aS'till about the 18th century india was considered to be the only source of diamond'

aS'till of course the world began mining for diamond in africa'
p3677
aS'i am delighted that south africas minister for mineral resources is with us today'
p3678

p3679
aS'today india is the worlds largest centre for cutting and polishing diamond and its largest importer of uncut diamond'
p3680
aS'diamond has become a universal symbol of wealth and enduring love'
p3681
aS'but in india it is also a great source of jobs for our people'
p3682
aS'the gems and jewellery sector in india employs nearly 3'
p3683
aS'5 million people 1 million of them work in the diamond industry'
p3684
aS'gems and jewellery 35 india today exports cut and polished diamond worth 20 billion us dollars'
p3685
aS'surat has emerged as the biggest centre in the world for cutting and polishing diamonds'
p3686
aS'- - 30 - it hosts enterprises with some of the most advanced technologies and machinery in the world'
p3687
aS'although the bharat diamond bourse was established in 2010 it has become the worlds largest exchange in the world'
p3688
aS'few in india would be aware that out of ten polished diamond pieces sold globally nine have been processed in india'
p3689
aS'- the diamonds sparkle in the world because of the skills of indian workers'
p3690
aS'so we welcome the efforts of this conference and the world mark foundation to increase the global market for diamonds'
p3691
aS'however rough diamond in india comes from abroad'
p3692
aS'and it mostly comes indirectly through places like antwerp and dubai'
p3693
aS'of course antwerp trade is now run mainly by indians'
p3694
aS'while most of rough diamonds from russia come to india less than 20 comes directly to india'
p3695
aS'we have with us today the head of russian company alrosa which controls most of the production and trade in rough diamonds in russia'
p3696
aS'it has direct sales contract with 7 to 8 indian companies'
p3697
aS'i know that there are representatives of many bourses here'
p3698
aS'but i will be honest and say that i want major diamond mining companies to sell directly to the indian diamond industry'
p3699
aS'it will be good for them and for india'
p3700
aS'i have made three proposals to president putin'
p3701
aS'first i would like alrosa to have direct long term contracts with more indian companies'
p3702
aS'i am pleased to know that they are moving in that direction'
p3703
aS'second i want alrosa and others to trade directly on our bourse'
p3704
aS'we have decided to create a special notified zone in which major mining companies can import rough diamonds on a consignment basis and re-export unsold ones'
p3705
aS'this is going to benefit indian diamond industry and create more jobs for our youth'
p3706
aS'third i asked president putin to reform regulations so that russian jewellery makers can send their rough diamond to india and re-import polished diamond without paying duty'
p3707
aS'this will give a boost to our diamond industry'
p3708
aS'these measures will also boost india-russia economic ties'
p3709
aS'india and russia have outstanding cooperation in a broad range of areas'
p3710
aS'we want to focus on transforming our economic relations'
p3711
aS'we want to make this a key pillar of our relationship'
p3712
aS'our joint partnership - here is an indication of our new approach to expand our economic partnership'
p3713
aS'president putins enthusiasm for russian participation in our make in india programme will help expand manufacturing and create jobs for our people'
p3714
aS'there are many other sectors in india like the diamond industry which have huge potential for creating employment and generating exports'
p3715
aS'their modernisation and development is a great priority for my government'
p3716
aS'i am deeply encouraged by the level of international participation'
p3717
aS'in every sector of business you will find that india not only offers productive business opportunities but it is also easy to work in'
p3718
aS'you will find an environment that is welcoming and responsive'
p3719
aS'thank you all for coming'
p3720
aS'my dear fellow countrymen today i have this great opportunity of interacting with you again'
p3721
aS'you must be wondering why a prime minister should be interacting the way i am doing it'
p3722
aS'well first and foremost i am a less of your prime minister and more of a pradhan sewak serving the people'
p3723
aS'since childhood i have been hearing that by sharing our intensity of pain become less while the intensity of our joys grow manifold'
p3724
aS'well i think this is the guiding thought behind mann ki baat'
p3725
aS'it is an opportunity for me to sometimes share my concern and sometimes my joy'
p3726
aS'sharing my deepest concerns with you makes me feel light hearted and sharing my joy just doubles my happiness'
p3727
aS'last time i mentioned my concern about the youth of the country'
p3728
aS'it is not because you chose me as the prime minister but because i feel concerned as an individual'
p3729
aS'sons and daughters of many families are caught in the trap of drugs'
p3730
aS'it just does not destroy the person involved but his entire family the society and the nation at large'
p3731
aS'drug is such a grave menace which destroys the most powerful individuals'
p3732
aS'while serving as the chief minister of gujarat my officers with good records would often come to ask for leave'
p3733
aS'initially they would hesitate to spell out the reasons however on insisting they revealed that their child had fallen into the drug trap and they now need to spend time with their kids and rehabilitate them'
p3734
aS'i could see the bravest of my officers struggling to control their tears'
p3735
aS'i met suffering mothers too'
p3736
aS'in punjab i had the chance to meet some mothers who were very angry and yet concerned about their children who had fallen into the trap of drugs'
p3737
aS'we have to work together as a society to tackle this menace'
p3738
aS'i understand that the youth who fall into this drug trap are often blamed'
p3739
aS'we blame these youth as being careless and irresponsible'
p3740
aS'we perceive that the victims are bad but the fact is that the drugs are bad'
p3741
aS'the youth are not wrong it is this addiction which is wrong'
p3742
aS'let us not blame and wrong our kids'
p3743
aS'let us get rid of this habit of addiction and not victimize our kids'
p3744
aS'blaming the kids would push them further into addiction'
p3745
aS'this is in fact a psycho-socio-medical issue and let us treat it as such a problem'
p3746
aS'this menace needs to be handled carefully as its solution is not limited to medical intervention only'
p3747
aS'the individual concerned his family friends the society the government and the legal system all have to work in tandem to tackle this menace'
p3748
aS'each one of us have to contribute to get rid of this menace'
p3749
ag449
aS'a few days ago i had organized a dgp level conference in assam'
p3750
aS'i expressed my concern over this issue and my displeasure at the non-serious attitude of the people concerned'
p3751
aS'i have asked the police department to seriously discuss this issue and come out with relevant solutions'
p3752
aS'i have suggested the department to launch a toll free helpline'
p3753
aS'the families often feel ashamed to come out in open about the addiction problem of their children'
p3754
aS'they have no one to confide in'
p3755
aS'parents from any part any corner of the country can freely approach the police if their children have fallen a victim to addiction'
p3756
aS'the department has taken this suggestion seriously and working towards its fulfillment'
p3757
aS'the drug menace brings about the three ds'
p3758
aS'these three ds are not the ones related to entertainment but i am talking about the three ds related to the three vices'
p3759
aS'first d is darkness the second d is destruction and the third d is devastation'
p3760
aS'drugs lead a person to a blind path of destruction'
p3761
aS'there is nothing left in its trail but devastation'
p3762
aS'this is a topic of great concern and demands total attention'
p3763
aS'i had mentioned this topic in my last address in mann ki baat'
p3764
aS'we received more than 7000 letters on our akashvani address'
p3765
aS'some letters were received in the government offices'
p3766
aS'we received responses on government portal mygov'
p3767
aS'in online and through e-mails'
p3768
aS'lakhs of comments were received on twitter and facebook'
p3769
aS'hence a deep rooted concern in the societys psyche has found a voice'
p3770
aS'i am especially thankful to the media of our country for carrying this concern forward'
p3771
aS'many channels conducted hour long programs'
p3772
aS'these programs were not just meant to criticize the government'
p3773
aS'they were forums for open discussion a concern and an effort to come out with workable solutions'
p3774
aS'these initiatives created background for healthy discussions'
p3775
aS'the government was also sensitized to its responsibilities in this direction'
p3776
aS'the government can no longer remain neutral to these concerns'
p3777
aS'there is a question i want to ask these youth caught in the drug trap'
p3778
aS'i want to ask these youth that when for three or four hours they are in a state of intoxication they might be feeling free of all concerns free of all tensions and in a different world altogether'
p3779
aS'but have you ever lent a thought to the fact that when you buy drugs where does this money go to'
p3780
aS'have you ever thought about it'
p3781
aS'just make a guess'
p3782
aS'what if this drug money goes to the terrorists'
p3783
aS'what if this money is spent by the terrorists to procure weapons'
p3784
aS'and with this weapon the very same terrorist might be pumping bullets in the heart of my soldiers'
p3785
aS'the soldier of my country gets martyred'
p3786
aS'have you ever thought about our soldiers- a soldier who is so dear to his mother the treasured son of mother india the brave son of the soil is hit by a bullet probably funded by the money spent on purchasing drugs'
p3787
aS'i know and firmly believe that you too love your motherland and have tremendous respect for our soldiers'
p3788
aS'then how can you support a habit which funds drug mafia and the terrorists'
p3789
aS'some people feel that when a person is in despair faces failures and when he is directionless he is an easy prey to drugs'
p3790
aS'but i feel that people who lack ambition do not have any set goals and targets who have a deep vacuum in their lives are the ones where drugs will have an easy access'
p3791
aS'if you want to avoid drugs and save your children from this menace then foster ambition in them give them dreams to pursue and make them individuals with a desire to achieve something in life'
p3792
aS'then you will see that they will not be easily distracted'
p3793
aS'their aim then will be to achieve something in life'
p3794
aS'have you ever followed a sportsmans life'
p3795
aS'a sportsman is motivated forever'
p3796
aS'in the bleak winters everyone feels like sleeping in the warmth of a quilt but a sportsman will still rise at 4 or 5 and go for his workouts'
p3797
aS'why'
p3798
aS'because the goal is set'
p3799
aS'similarly if your child would be aimless there are chances of himher to fall prey to menace like drugs'
p3800
aS'i remember the words of vivekananda'
p3801
aS'these words are very apt for all the young people'
p3802
aS'just keep repeating this thought over and over again'
p3803
aS'take a thought make it your life'
p3804
aS'ponder on it and dream about it'
p3805
aS'make it an integral part of your dreams'
p3806
aS'make it a part of your mind brain veins and each and every part of your body and forget everything else'
p3807
aS'this thought of vivekananda is apt for every young person and that is why i say that each person should have an ambition in life'
p3808
aS'having an ambition does not allow your focus on unnecessary things'
p3809
aS'some take it under peer pressure because it looks cool some consider it as a style statement'
p3810
aS'so sometimes the youth inadvertently fall into this serious trap due to the wrong mental perception'
p3811
aS'addiction is neither cool nor a style statement'
p3812
aS'in reality it is a precursor to destruction'
p3813
aS'so whenever your friends boast about their drug habits do not applaud and enjoy such conversation'
p3814
aS'do not be a mute spectator to such absurdities'
p3815
aS'have the courage to stand against such conversations and say no'
p3816
aS'have the guts to despise such a conversation reject such a conversation and have the guts to tell the person that he is wrong'
p3817
aS'i would like to share some views with the parents too'
p3818
aS'these days none of us have time'
p3819
aS'all of us are running against time to earn our livelihood'
p3820
aS'we are racing against time to improve the quality of our lives'
p3821
aS'but in this blind race do we have the time to spare for our kids'
p3822
aS'do we ever work for our kids spiritual progress and discuss it with them rather we discuss only material progress'
p3823
aS'how are they doing in their studies what has been their progress in exam what to eat and what not to eat where to go and where not to go majorly these topics form the core of the entire interactions'
p3824
aS'do we share such a relationship that our children can bare their hearts to us'
p3825
aS'i request all of you to do this'
p3826
aS'if your children share a frank relationship then you can very well know what is going on in their life'
p3827
aS'children do not take to bad habits suddenly'
p3828
aS'it happens gradually and it also impacts the home'
p3829
aS'observe the changes that are happening in your home'
p3830
aS'if you observe closely then i believe that you may be successful in detecting the problem at the very beginning'
p3831
aS'be aware of your childs friend circle and dont keep your conversations focused just about progress'
p3832
aS'your concern should extend to their inner depths their thoughts their logic their books their friends and their mobiles - how and where are they spending their time'
p3833
aS'these need to be taken care of'
p3834
aS'i believe that no one else can do what a parent can for their kids'
p3835
aS'our ancestors have left us certain pearls of wisdom and that is why they are known as statesmen'
p3836
aS'a saying goes like this paanch varsh laaw lijiyedass laaw tadan deipaanch varsh laaw lijiyedass laaw tadan deisut hi solah varsh meinmitra sarij gani deithis means that till 5 years of age a child should grow in the loving and tender care of his parents by the time he is 10 the values of discipline should be inculcated in him'
p3837
aS'sometimes we see that an intelligent mother gets angry and does not speak with her child throughout the day'
p3838
aS'this is a big punishment for the child'
p3839
aS'the mother punishes herself but the child too gets punished in turn'
p3840
aS'the mother just has to say that i will not talk and the 10 year old will remain worried the whole day long'
p3841
aS'he changes his habit and by the time he is of 16 years then the relationship should turn like a friend towards him'
p3842
aS'there should be an open conversation with him'
p3843
aS'this is a brilliant advice which has been passed on by our ancestors'
p3844
aS'i would like to see this inculcated in our family life'
p3845
aS'another thing brought to our notice is the role of the pharmacists'
p3846
aS'some of the medicines lead to addiction'
p3847
aS'so such medicines should not be distributed without a doctors prescription'
p3848
aS'sometimes a simple thing like a cough syrup can trigger addiction'
p3849
aS'it becomes the starting point for addiction'
p3850
aS'there are quite a few things that i would not like to raise from this platform'
p3851
aS'but we will have to follow and accept this discipline'
p3852
aS'these days many children from villages go to city for higher education and start living in a hostel or a boarding school'
p3853
aS'i have heard that sometimes these avenues become the entry point of such addiction'
p3854
aS'for this the education system the society and the security force will have to act as a vigilante'
p3855
aS'each one will have to fulfill their roles and responsibilities'
p3856
aS'the government will fulfill the responsibilities on its end'
p3857
aS'we should constantly strive to fulfill our obligations'
p3858
aS'i would also like to mention about the letters we have received'
p3859
aS'some of them are interesting some are filled with grief and some are inspiring'
p3860
aS'i can not mention all but i would like to mention one'
p3861
aS'there was a certain mr dutt'
p3862
aS'he was deep into addiction'
p3863
aS'he was also jailed where he had several restrictions'
p3864
aS'then later his life changed'
p3865
aS'he studied in jail and then his life was transformed'
p3866
aS'his story is very famous'
p3867
aS'he was in yerawada jail'
p3868
aS'there might be many such inspiring stories'
p3869
aS'many people have been victorious in their fight against addiction'
p3870
aS'we too can come out of such habits and so we should definitely try'
p3871
aS'we should make efforts for de-addiction and rehabilitation'
p3872
aS'i would ask celebrities to be a part of this initiative - be it from the field of cinema sports or someone concerned with public life'
p3873
aS'be it the cultural or spiritual world we should use every possible platform to create awareness'
p3874
aS'there should be constant messages in public interest'
p3875
aS'they will certainly have an effect'
p3876
aS'those active on the social media i would request them to create a continuous online movement by joining drugsfreeindia hash-tag'
p3877
aS'this is more relevant because most of the addicted youth are a part of the social media'
p3878
aS'if we take this drugsfreeindia hash-tag movement forward then we will do a great service for public awareness and education'
p3879
aS'i want to take this concern forward'
p3880
aS'i would request all those who have successfully come out of this addiction to share their stories'
p3881
aS'i touched this topic because like i said in the beginning grief becomes less on sharing'
p3882
aS'this is a topic of national concern and i am not here to sermonize'
p3883
aS'and neither am i entitled to preach'
p3884
aS'i am just sharing my grief with you'
p3885
aS'those families who are suffering from this menace i want to share their pain as well'
p3886
aS'i want to create a responsible environment'
p3887
aS'there can be difference of opinions but let us make a beginning somewhere'
p3888
aS'like i mentioned before i want to share happiness'
p3889
aS'last week i had the opportunity to meet the blind cricket team'
p3890
aS'they had won the world cup'

p3892
aS'god has given us everything eyes hands legs i'
p3893
ag1875
aS'we are totally capable yet we lack this kind of determination and passion which i could see in the blind cricketers'
p3894
aS'what zeal and enthusiasm really it was contagious'
p3895
aS'i felt super charged after meeting them'
p3896
aS'such incidents bring great pleasure in life'
p3897
aS'in the past few days there was yet another important news'
p3898
aS'the cricket team from kashmir defeated mumbai on their home ground'
p3899
aS'i do not view it as a matter of someones victory and others loss'
p3900
aS'i view it differently'
p3901
aS'all the stadiums in kashmir have been inundated after the floods'
p3902
aS'kashmir is passing through a tough phase'
p3903
aS'the circumstances have been extremely grim with these boys not standing any chance to practice'
p3904
aS'but the team spirit shown by these boys their conviction and determination is awe inspiring'
p3905
aS'these boys have shown us that one can overcome the most trying and testing circumstances if one remains focused on our goals'
p3906
aS'this news gave me immense pleasure and i take this opportunity to congratulate all these players on their victory'
p3907
aS'two days back the united nations has decided to celebrate june 21st as international yoga day'
p3908

p3909
aS'our ancestors developed a beautiful tradition and today the entire world is associated with it'
p3910
aS'it does not merely benefit one personally but it has the potential to bring all the people together globally'
p3911
aS'the entire world came together on the issue of yoga in the un and a unanimous resolution was passed just two days back'
p3912
aS'177 countries became the co-sponsors'
p3913
aS'in the past when it was decided to celebrate the birthday mr nelson mandela 165 countries became co-sponsors'
p3914
aS'before that efforts were on for international toilet day and 122 nations became co-sponsors to that initiative too'
p3915
aS'for celebrating oct 2nd as non violence day 140 countries became co-sponsors before that'

p4232
aS'for instance i recently assured public sector banks they will have total autonomy in taking business decisions without any interference from government on loans and their operations'
p4233
aS'we need to use technology to deliver good governance'
p4234
aS'whether it is a simple one like biometric-based attendance which has improved office attendance and work culture'
p4235
aS'or a cutting edge one like space technology in mapping and planning'
p4236
aS'i intend to launch a massive national program for pds computerisation'
p4237
aS'the entire pds supply chain from the fci godown to the ration shop and consumer will be computerised'
p4238
aS'technology will drive welfare and efficient food delivery'
p4239
aS'a major institutional reform is the move away from merely planning to transforming india'
p4240
aS'the setting up of the national institution for transforming india niti aayog is a step in this direction'
p4241
aS'this will take the country forward on the path of cooperative federalism with a competitive zeal'
p4242
aS'the niti aayog is our mantra for creating trust and partnership between the centre and states'
p4243
aS'this list can be endless'
p4244
aS'i can go on for days but i do not think we have the time'
p4245
aS'however i have given you a sense of the immense activity we are engaged in'
p4246
aS'we have done a lot so far and more will be done in future'
p4247
aS'friends reforms are not an end in itself'
p4248
aS'reforms must have a concrete objective'
p4249
aS'the objective must be to improve the welfare of the people'
p4250
aS'approaches may be many'
p4251
aS'but the goal is one'
p4252
aS'reforms may not be apparent to one and all at first sight'
p4253
aS'but small acts can drive reforms'
p4254
aS'what appears minor can actually be vital and fundamental'
p4255
aS'further there is no contradiction between doing big tickets items and doing small things'
p4256
aS'one approach is to have new policies programmes large projects and path breaking changes'
p4257
aS'another approach is to focus on the small things that matter create a peoples movement and generate mass momentum which then drives development'
p4258
aS'we need to follow both paths'
p4259
aS'let me explain this a bit'
p4260
aS'generating 20000 mw of power attracts a lot of attention'
p4261
aS'that is important'
p4262
aS'at the same time 20000 mw of power can be saved through a peoples movement for energy efficiency'
p4263
aS'the end result is similar'
p4264
aS'the second is more difficult but is as important as the first'
p4265
aS'in the same way improving a thousand primary schools is as important as opening a new university'
p4266
aS'the new aiims we are setting up will improve public health in the same way as our promise of health assurance'
p4267
aS'to me health assurance is not a scheme'
p4268
aS'it is about ensuring that every rupee spent on health is well spent that every citizen has access to proper healthcare'
p4269
aS'similarly when we do swachh bharat it has multiple impacts'
p4270
aS'it is not just a fad or a slogan'
p4271
aS'it changes peoples mindsets'
p4272
aS'it changes our lifestyle'
p4273
aS'swachhata becomes a habit'
p4274
aS'waste management generates economic activity'
p4275
aS'it can create lakhs of swachhata entrepreneurs'
p4276
aS'the nation gets identified with cleanliness'
p4277
aS'and of course it has a huge impact on health'
p4278
aS'after all diarrhoea and other diseases can not be defeated without swachhata'
p4279
aS'the mantra of independence was satyagraha'
p4280
aS'and the warriors were - satyagrahis'
p4281
aS'the mantra of new age india must be - swachhagraha'
p4282
aS'and the warriors will be - swachhagrahis'
p4283
aS'take the case of tourism'
p4284
aS'it is an untapped economic activity'
p4285
aS'but tapping it requires a swachh bharat'
p4286
aS'it needs improvement in infrastructure and telecom connectivity'
p4287
aS'it requires better education and skill development'
p4288
aS'therefore a simple goal can generate reforms in multiple sectors'
p4289
aS'people must understand the clean ganga program as an economic activity also'
p4290
aS'the gangetic plains account for 40 of our population'
p4291
aS'they have over one hundred towns and thousands of villages'
p4292
aS'improving ganga will develop new infrastructure'
p4293
aS'it will promote tourism'
p4294
aS'it will create a modern economy helping millions of people'
p4295
aS'in addition it preserves the environment'
p4296
aS'railways is another example'
p4297
aS'there are thousands of railway stations in the country where not more than 1 or 2 trains stop in a day'
p4298
aS'these facilities created at a cost remain unused for most of the day'
p4299
aS'these stations can become growth points for the nearby villages'
p4300
aS'they can be used for skill development'
p4301
aS'small indeed is beautiful'
p4302
aS'in agriculture too our main goal is to raise productivity'
p4303
aS'this will require using technology increasing soil fertility producing more crop per drop and bringing the latest from lab to land'
p4304
aS'cost of cultivation will go down as efficiency rises'
p4305
aS'this will make agriculture viable'
p4306
aS'on the output side the entire value chain in agriculture will be addressed through better storage transport and food processing linkages'
p4307
aS'we will link farmers to global markets'
p4308
aS'we will give the world the taste of india'
p4309
aS'friends i have often called for minimum government maximum governance'
p4310
aS'this is not a slogan'
p4311
aS'this is an important principle to transform india'
p4312
aS'- government systems suffer from two weaknesses'
p4313
aS'they are complex'
p4314
aS'and they are slow'
p4315
aS'in life people go on a chaar dham yatra to get moksha'
p4316
aS'in government a file has to go to chattees dham and yet not get moksha'
p4317
aS'we need to change this'
p4318
aS'our systems need to bemade sharp effective fast and flexible'
p4319
aS'this requires simplification of processes and having trust in citizens'
p4320
aS'this needs a policy driven state'
p4321
aS'what is maximum governance minimum government'
p4322
aS'it means government has no business to be in business'
p4323
aS'there are many parts of the economy where the private sector will do better and deliver better'
p4324
aS'in 20 years of liberalisation we have not changed a command and control mindset'
p4325
aS'we think it is okay for government to meddle in the working of firms'
p4326
aS'this must change'
p4327
aS'but this is not a call for anarchy'
p4328
aS'first we need to focus government upon the things that are required of the state'
p4329
aS'second we need to achieve competence in government so that the state delivers on the things it sets out to do'
p4330
aS'why do we need the state'
p4331
aS'there are 5 main components the first is public goods such as defence police and judiciary'
p4332
aS'the second is externalities which hurt others such as pollution'
p4333
aS'for this we need a regulatory system'
p4334
aS'the third is market power where monopolies need controlsthe fourth is information gaps where you need someone to ensure that medicines are genuine and so on'
p4335
aS'last we need a well designed welfare and subsidy mechanism to ensure that the bottom of society is protected from deprivation'
p4336
aS'this specially includes education and healthcare'
p4337
aS'these are five places where we require government'
p4338
aS'in the five areas where we need government we require competent efficient and non-corrupt arms of government'
p4339
aS'we in government must constantly ask the question how much money am i spending and what outcomes am i getting in return'
p4340
aS'for this government agencies have to be improved to become competent'
p4341
aS'this requires rewriting some laws'
p4342
aS'laws are the dna of government'
p4343
aS'they must evolve with time'
p4344
aS'india is a 2 trillion dollar economy today'
p4345
aS'can we not dream of an india with a 20 trillion dollar economy'
p4346
aS'should we not create the environment for this to happen'
p4347
aS'we are preparing the ground for it'
p4348
aS'this is hard work'
p4349
aS'quick and easy reforms will not be enough for creating a fast growing economy'
p4350
aS'that is our challenge and that is what we aim to do'
p4351
aS'digital india and skill india are attempts in this direction'
p4352
aS'digital india will reform government systems eliminate waste increase access and empower citizens'
p4353
aS'it will drive the next wave of growth which will be knowledge-driven'
p4354
aS'broadband in every village with a wide range of online services will transform india in a manner we can not foresee'
p4355
aS'skill india will harness the demographic dividend which everyone talks of'
p4356
aS'friends improvement in governance is a continuous process'
p4357
aS'we are making changes wherever acts rules and procedures are not in tune with needs'
p4358
aS'we are cutting down on multiple clearances that choke investment'
p4359
aS'our complex tax system is crying for reform which we have initiated'
p4360
aS'i believe in speed'
p4361
aS'i will push through change at a fast pace'
p4362
aS'you will appreciate this in times to come'
p4363
aS'at the same time we need to take care of the poor deprived and left behind sections of society'
p4364
aS'i believe that subsidies are needed for them'
p4365
aS'what we need is a well targeted system of subsidy delivery'
p4366
aS'we need to cut subsidy leakages not subsidies themselves'
p4367
aS'wastage as i said earlier must be removed in subsidies'
p4368
aS'the target group should be clearly identified and the subsidies should be well delivered'
p4369
aS'the ultimate objective of subsidies should be to empower the poor to break the cycle of poverty and become foot-soldiers in our war on poverty'
p4370
aS'at this point i would also say that development has to result in jobs'
p4371
aS'reforms economic growth progress all are empty words if they do not translate into jobs'
p4372
aS'what we need is not just more production but mass production and production by masses'
p4373
aS'friends economic development can not take a nation forward on its own'
p4374
aS'development has many dimensions'
p4375
aS'while on one hand we need higher incomes we also need a society which is cohesive'
p4376
aS'which balances the stress and strain of a modern economy'
p4377
aS'history is witness to the rise and fall of nations'
p4378
aS'even now many countries have become rich in an economic sense but are poor in a social sense'
p4379
aS'their family systems value systems social networks and other elements which hold a society together have broken'
p4380
aS'we should not go down that path'
p4381
aS'we need a society and economy which complement each other'
p4382
aS'that is the only way for a nation to go forward'
p4383
aS'further development seems to have become the agenda only of government'
p4384
aS'it is seen as a scheme'
p4385
aS'that should not be the case'
p4386
aS'development should be everyones agenda'
p4387
aS'it should be a peoples movement'
p4388
aS'friends like the rest of the world we are concerned about two dangers - terrorism and climate change'
p4389
aS'together we will find a way to face these'
p4390
aS'today everyone is looking towards asia for inspiration and growth'
p4391
aS'and within asia india is important'
p4392
aS'not just for its size but for its democracy and its values'
p4393
aS'indias core philosophy is sarva mangala maangalyam and sarve bhavantu sukhinah'
p4394
aS'this is a call for global welfare global cooperation and balanced living'
p4395
aS'india can be a role model of growth and cohesiveness for the rest of the world'
p4396
aS'for this we need a workforce and economy which meet global needs and expectations'
p4397
aS'we need to quickly improve social indicators'
p4398
aS'india should no longer be bracketed with the least developed'
p4399
aS'we can do this'
p4400
aS'swami vivekananda had said arise awake do not stop until the goal has been attained'
p4401
aS'this should inspire us all to achieve the vision of a new age india'
p4402
aS'together we can'
p4403
aS'thank you'
p4404
aS'today shri barack obama president of the united states joins us in a special programme of mann ki baat'
p4405
aS'for the last few months i have been sharing my mann ki baat with you'
p4406
aS'but today people from various parts of the country have asked questions'
p4407
aS'but most of the questions are connected to politics foreign policy economic policy'
p4408
aS'however some questions touch the heart'
p4409
aS'and i believe if we touch those questions today we shall be able to reach out to the common man in different parts of the country'
p4410
aS'and therefore the questions asked in press conferences or discussed in meetings instead of those if we discuss what comes from the heart and repeat it hum it we get a new energy'
p4411
aS'and therefore in my opinion those questions are more important'
p4412
aS'some people wonder what does barack mean'
p4413
aS'i was searching for the meaning of barack'
p4414
aS'in swahili language which is spoken in parts of africa barack means one who is blessed'
p4415
aS'i believe along with a name his family gave him a big gift'
p4416
aS'african countries have lived by the ancient idea of ubuntu which alludes to the oneness in humanity'
p4417
aS'they say i am because we are'
p4418
aS'despite the gap in centuries and borders there is the same spirit of vasudhaiva kutumbakam which speak of in india'
p4419
aS'this is the great shared heritage of humanity'
p4420
aS'this unites us'
p4421
aS'when we discuss mahatma gandhi we remember henry thoreau from whom mahatma gandhi learnt disobedience'
p4422
aS'when we talk about martin luther king or obama we hear from their lips respect for mahatma gandhi'
p4423
aS'these are the things that unite the world'
p4424
aS'today barack obama is with us'
p4425
aS'i will first request him to share his thoughts'
p4426
aS'then i and barack will both answer the questions that have been addressed to us'
p4427
aS'it is true that when i first went to america i was not lucky enough to visit the white house'
p4428
aS'there is an iron fence far from the white house'
p4429
aS'we stood outside the fence and took a photograph'
p4430
aS'white house is visible in the background'
p4431
aS'now that i have become prime minister that photo too has become popular'
p4432
aS'but at that time i had never thought that sometime in my life i would get a chance to visit the white house'
p4433
aS'but when i visited the white house one thing touched my heart'
p4434
aS'i can never forget that'
p4435
aS'barack gave me a book a book that he had located after considerable effort'
p4436
aS'that book had become famous in 1894'
p4437
aS'swami vivekananda the inspiration of my life had gone to chicago to participate in the world religions conference'
p4438
aS'and this book was a compilation of the speeches delivered at the world religions conference'
p4439
aS'that touched my heart'
p4440
aS'and not just this'
p4441
aS'he turned the pages of the book and showed me what was written there'
p4442
aS'he had gone through the entire book'
p4443
aS'and he told me with pride i come from the chicago where swami vivekananda had come'
p4444
aS'these words touched my heart a lot'
p4445
aS'and i will treasure this throughout my life'
p4446
aS'so once standing far from the white house and taking a photo and then to visit the white house and to receive a book on someone whom i respect'
p4447
aS'you can imagine how it would have touched my heart'
p4448
aS'no'
p4449
aS'i never imagined it'
p4450
aS'because as barack said i come from a very ordinary family'
p4451
aS'but for a long time i have been telling everyone never dream of becoming something'
p4452
aS'if you wish to dream dream of doing something'
p4453
aS'when we do something we get satisfaction and also get inspiration to do something new'
p4454
aS'if we only dream of becoming something and can not fulfil the dream then we only get disappointed'
p4455
aS'and therefore i never dreamt of becoming something'
p4456
aS'even today i have no dream of becoming something'
p4457
aS'but i do dream of doing something'
p4458
aS'serving mother india serving 125 crore indians there can be no greater dream than this'
p4459
aS'that is what i have to do'
p4460
aS'when i was young i used to see kennedys pictures in indian newspapers'
p4461
aS'his personality was very impressive'
p4462
aS'but your question is who has inspired me'
p4463
aS'i liked reading as a child'
p4464
aS'and i got an opportunity to read the biography of benjamin franklin'
p4465
aS'he lived in the eighteenth century'
p4466
aS'and he was not an american president'
p4467
aS'but his biography is so inspiring how a person can intelligently try to change his life'
p4468
aS'if we feel excessively sleepy how can we reduce that'
p4469
aS'if we feel like eating too much how can we work towards eating less'
p4470
aS'if people get upset with you that can not meet them because of the pressure of work then how to solve this problem'
p4471
aS'he has addressed such issues in his biography'
p4472
aS'and i tell everyone we should read benjamin franklins biography'
p4473
aS'even today it inspires me'
p4474
aS'and benjamin franklin had a multi-dimensional personality'
p4475
aS'he was a politician he was a political scientist he was a social worker he was a diplomat'
p4476
aS'and he came from an ordinary family'
p4477
aS'he could not even complete his education'
p4478
aS'but till today his thoughts have an impact on american life'
p4479
aS'i find his life truly inspiring'
p4480
aS'and i tell you too if you read his biography you will find ways to transform your life too'
p4481
aS'and he has talked about simple things'
p4482
aS'so i feel you will be inspired as much as i have been'
p4483
aS'indeed barack has spoken words from the heart mann ki baat'
p4484
aS'whatever position we may hold we are human too'
p4485
aS'simple things can inspire us'
p4486
aS'i also wish to narrate an experience'
p4487
aS'for many years i was like an ascetic'
p4488
aS'i got food at other peoples homes'
p4489
aS'whoever invited me used to feed me as well'
p4490
aS'once a family invited me over for a meal repeatedly'
p4491
aS'i would not go because i felt they are too poor and if i go to eat at their place i will become a burden on them'
p4492
aS'but eventually i had to bow to their request and love'
p4493
aS'and i went to eat a meal at their home'
p4494
aS'it was a small hut where we sat down to eat'
p4495
aS'they offered me roti made of bajra millet and mik'
p4496
aS'their young child was looking at the milk'
p4497
aS'i felt the child has never even seen milk'
p4498
aS'so i gave that small bowl of milk to the child'
p4499
aS'and he drank it within seconds'
p4500
aS'his family members were angry with him'
p4501
aS'and i felt that perhaps that child has never had any milk apart from his mothers milk'
p4502
aS'and maybe they had bought milk so that i could have a good meal'
p4503
aS'this incident inspired me a lot'
p4504
aS'a poor person living in a hut could think so much about my well-being'
p4505
aS'so i should devote my life to their service'
p4506
aS'so these are the things that serve as inspiration'
p4507
aS'and barack has also spoken about what can touch the heart'

p4581
aS'the whole country is proud of their recognition'
p4582

aS'the life and deeds of saint chavara and saint euphresia are an inspiration not only to the christian community but to humanity as a whole'
p4584
aS'they are shining examples of dedication to god through selfless service for the betterment of mankind'
p4585
aS'saint chavara was a man of prayer and also a social reformer'
p4586
aS'in an era when access to education was limited he stressed that every church should have a school'
p4587
aS'he thus opened the doors of education to people from all sections of society'
p4588
aS'few outside kerala know that he started a sanskrit school and also a printing press'
p4589
aS'his contribution towards womens empowerment was also noteworthy'
p4590
aS'saint euphrasia was a mystic who dedicated her life to prayer and devotion to god'
p4591
aS'both these saints dedicated their life to god through service of fellow beings'
p4592
aS'the ancient indian saying welfare of the world is the way to moksha salvation explains their life'
p4593
aS'friends spiritualism is rooted in indias heritage'
p4594
aS'indian saints and greek sages had intellectual and spiritual exchanges thousands of years back'
p4595
aS'indias openness to new ideas is manifest in the rig veda let noble thoughts come to us from all sides'
p4596
aS'this philosophy has guided our intellectual discourse since time immemorial'
p4597
aS'mother india gave birth to many religious and spiritual streams'
p4598
aS'some of them have even travelled beyond indian borders'
p4599
aS'the tradition of welcoming respecting and honouring all faiths is as old as india itself'
p4600
aS'as swami vivekananda said we believe not only in universal toleration but we accept all religions as true'
p4601
aS'what swami vivekananda had said a century ago holds good and will for ever not only for this nation but also for this government or for that matter any government in india run by any political party'
p4602
aS'this principle of equal respect and treatment for all faiths has been a part of indias ethos for thousands of years'
p4603
aS'and that is how it became integral to the constitution of india'
p4604
aS'our constitution did not evolve in a vacuum'
p4605
aS'it has roots in the ancient cultural traditions of india'
p4606
aS'gurudev rabindranath tagore had inspired us to dream of a land where the mind is without fear and the head is held high'
p4607
aS'it is that heaven of freedom we are duty bound to create and preserve'
p4608
aS'we believe that there is truth in every religion'
p4609
aS'friends let me now come to the issue which is central and critical for peace and harmony in the contemporary world'
p4610
aS'the world is increasingly witnessing division and hostility on religious lines'
p4611
aS'this has become a matter of global concern'
p4612
aS'in this context the ancient indian plea of mutual respect for all faiths is now beginning to manifest in global discourse'
p4613
aS'this long felt need and urge for mutually respectful relations led to the interfaith conference on faith in human rights at the hague on tenth december 2008'
p4614
aS'this was coincidentally also the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights by the united nations'
p4615
aS'religious leaders representing every major world religion - christianity hinduism judaism bahai faith buddhism islam taoism and indigenous religions met discussed and pledged to uphold the universal declaration and of freedom of religion or belief'
p4616
aS'in their historic declaration this is how they defined what constitutes freedom of faith and how it is to be safeguarded'
p4617
aS'we consider the freedom to have to retain and to adopt a religion or belief is a personal choice of a citizen'
p4618
aS'the world is at cross roads which if not crossed properly can throw us back to the dark days of bigotry fanaticism and bloodshed'
p4619
aS'this harmonious convergence among religions could not be achieved even when the world entered the third millennium'
p4620
aS'and now it has been'
p4621
aS'this shows that the rest of the world too is evolving along the lines of ancient india'
p4622
aS'speaking for india and for my government i declare that my government stands by every word of the above declaration'
p4623
aS'my government will ensure that there is complete freedom of faith and that everyone has the undeniable right to retain or adopt the religion of his or her choice without coercion or undue influence'

aS'my government will not allow any religious group belonging to the majority or the minority to incite hatred against others overtly or covertly'

aS'with this commitment i appeal to all religious groups to act with restraint mutual respect and tolerance in the true spirit of this ancient nation which is manifest in our constitution and is in line with the hague declaration'

p4644
aS'there are defence ministers senior officials and hundreds of business leaders from around the world'
p4645
aS'a big welcome to each of you'
p4646
aS'this is the largest ever aero india'
p4647
aS'this reflects a new level of confidence within our country and global interest in india'
p4648
aS'to many of you india is a major business opportunity'
p4649
aS'we have the reputation as the largest importer of defence equipment in the world'
p4650
aS'that may be music to the ears of some of you here'
p4651
aS'but this is one area where we would not like to be number one'
p4652
aS'our security challenges are well known'
p4653
aS'our international responsibilities are evident'
p4654
aS'we do need to increase our defence preparedness'
p4655
aS'we do have to modernize our defence forces'
p4656
aS'we have to equip ourselves for the needs of the future where technology will play a major role'
p4657
aS'as a nation of one billion people we also have huge requirements for managing internal security'
p4658
aS'we are increasingly integrating technology and systems into it'
p4659
aS'these opportunities make aero india an important international event'
p4660
aS'for me this is not just a trade fair for defence equipment'
p4661
aS'this is a mega meeting of one of the largest global supply chains with the most advanced technology and complex equipmentand a platform to launch indias defence manufacturing sector'
p4662
aS'a nation with a strong defence industry will not only be more secure'
p4663
aS'it will also reap rich economic benefits'
p4664
aS'it can boost investment expand manufacturing support enterprise raise the technology level and increase economic growth in the country'
p4665
aS'in india the defence industry in the government sector alone employs nearly 200000 workers and thousands of engineers and scientists'
p4666
aS'they produce an output of nearly 7 billion dollars annually'
p4667
aS'it also supports a very large pool of small and medium enterprises'
p4668
aS'our defence industry in private sector is still small'
p4669
aS'but it already employs thousands of people'
p4670
aS'this is despite the fact that nearly 60 of our defence equipment continues to be imported'
p4671
aS'and we are spending tens of billions of dollars on acquisitions from abroad'
p4672
aS'there are studies that show that even a 20 to 25 reduction in imports could directly create an additional 100000 to 120000 highly skilled jobs in india'
p4673
aS'if we could raise the percentage of domestic procurement from 40 to 70 in the next five years we would double the output in our defence industry'
p4674
aS'imagine the impact in terms of jobs created directly and in the related manufacturing and services sector'
p4675
aS'think of the spin off benefits on other sectors in terms of advanced materials and technologies'
p4676
aS'that is why we are focusing on developing indias defence industry with a sense of mission'
p4677
aS'this is why it is at the heart of our make in india programme'
p4678
aS'we are reforming our defence procurement policies and procedures'
p4679
aS'there would be a clear preference for equipment manufactured in india'
p4680
aS'our procurement procedures will ensure simplicity accountability and speedy decision making'
p4681
aS'we have raised the permitted level of foreign direct investment to 49'
p4682
aS'this can go higher if the project brings state-of-the art technology'
p4683
aS'we have permitted investments up to 24 by foreign institutional investments'
p4684
aS'and there is no longer a need to have a single indian investor with at least a 51 stake'
p4685
aS'industrial licensing requirements have been eliminated for a number of items'
p4686
aS'where it is needed the process has been simplified'
p4687
aS'we are expanding the role of private sector even for major platforms'
p4688
aS'our goal is to provide a level playing field for all'
p4689
aS'we speak in terms of national capacity not public sector or private sector'
p4690
aS'offsets system is a crucial instrument to develop and upgrade our defence industry'
p4691
aS'we have introduced significant reforms in our offsets policy'
p4692
aS'i am acutely aware that it still needs a lot of improvements'
p4693
aS'we will pursue them in consultation with domestic industry and our foreign partners'
p4694
aS'i want our offsets policy not as a means to export low-end products but to acquire state-of-the art technology and skills in core areas of priority'
p4695
aS'governments support for research and development is essential for defence sector'
p4696
aS'and it should also be accompanied by a degree of assurance on purchase'
p4697
aS'we are introducing a scheme to provide up to 80 of funding from the government for development of a prototype in india'
p4698
aS'and we are also launching a technology development fund'
p4699
aS'for too long our research and development has been confined to government laboratories'
p4700
aS'we must involve our scientists soldiers academia industry and independent experts more closely in research and development'
p4701
aS'last month at the army day reception i had asked to meet our officers and soldiers who had made the best innovations in our defence equipment'
p4702
aS'i was impressed with what i saw'
p4703
aS'finally we have made our export policies clearer simpler and predictable'
p4704
aS'but we will also abide by the highest standards of export controls and international responsibility'
p4705
aS'we will expand our exports but we will ensure that our equipment and technology do not fall into the wrong hands'
p4706
aS'indias record in this area has been impeccable and it will remain so'
p4707
aS'i am pleased with the positive impact of our policies'
p4708
aS'indian private corporations have responded with enthusiasm'
p4709
aS'there is new excitement in our small and medium scale sector'
p4710
aS'many of the biggest global firms are forming strategic partnerships in india'
p4711
aS'some of them have already begun using india as part of their global supply chains or engineering services'
p4712
aS'in september 2014 dynamatic technologies and its collaborator boeing inaugurated a plant in india to manufacture critical parts for a boeing helicopter that is sold globally'
p4713
aS'i understand that it was a day after make in india was launched'
p4714
aS'i am pleased to learn that the first set of parts is ready for shipment today'
p4715
aS'but we still need to do more'
p4716
aS'we have to further reform our acquisition and approval processes'
p4717
aS'we must indicate a clear roadmap of our future needs'
p4718
aS'this must take into account not only new technology trends but also the nature of future challenges'
p4719
aS'we must pay attention to developing supply chains with emphasis on innovation'
p4720
aS'we must bridge the gap between prototype development and quality of production'
p4721
aS'we must develop a financing system suited to the special needs of this industry'
p4722
aS'it is a market where buyers are mainly governments the capital investments are large and the risks are high'
p4723
aS'we must ensure that our tax system does not discriminate against domestic manufacture in comparison to imports'
p4724
aS'more broadly our defence industry will succeed more if we can transform the manufacturing sector in india'
p4725
aS'we need great infrastructure sound business climate clear investment policies ease of doing business stable and predictable tax regime and easy access to inputs'
p4726
aS'we need a national industry that produces advanced materials the most sophisticated electronics and the best engineering products'
p4727
aS'over the last eight months we have worked hard to create that environment for you'
p4728
aS'above all we need a vast pool of highly skilled and qualified human resources for the defence industry'
p4729
aS'our aerospace industry alone would need about 200000 people in another ten years'
p4730
aS'we will set up special universities and skill development centres to cater to our defence industry just as we have done in atomic energy and space'
p4731
aS'i have especially invited the state governments to come here with package of facilities to attract investments in defence manufacturing'
p4732
aS'distinguished guests this is a new era for the defence industry in india'
p4733
aS'it will be no longer enough to buy equipment and simply assemble them here'
p4734
aS'we have been doing this in the past without absorbing any technology or developing our own capabilities'
p4735
aS'in some areas we are where we were three decades ago'
p4736
aS'frankly our public sector needs to do much better than they are doing now'
p4737
aS'we have to exploit their huge assets and a vast potential'
p4738
aS'at the same time we have to make them accountable'
p4739
aS'we want to develop an industry is dynamic'
p4740
aS'it should constantly stay at the cutting edge of the global industry'
p4741
aS'i am confident that india will emerge as a major global centre for defence industry'
p4742
aS'we have the basic building blocks for it in india and a large nation requirement'
p4743
aS'we will build an industry that will have room for everyone public sector private sector and foreign firms'
p4744
aS'from sellers foreign firms must turn into strategic partners'
p4745
aS'we need their technology skills systems integration and manufacturing strength'
p4746
aS'the nature of industry is such that imports will always be there'
p4747
aS'in turn they can use india as part of their global supply chain'
p4748
aS'defence budgets around the world are becoming tighter'
p4749
aS'indias frugal but sophisticated manufacturing and engineering services sectors can help reduce costs'
p4750
aS'india can also be a base for export to third countries especially because of indias growing defence partnerships in asia and beyond'
p4751
aS'a strong indian defence industry will not only make india more secure'
p4752
aS'it will also make india more prosperous'
p4753
aS'aero india can be a catalyst in realizing our goals'
p4754

aS'today probably the entire day you must have been preoccupied with the ongoing cricket match'
p4760
aS'on the one hand you have exams and on the other this world cup you might be asking your younger sister to tell you the score of the match from time to time'
p4761
aS'sometimes you must be elated about the fact that holi is around the corner and then suddenly you would be feeling disappointed that even holi festivities will go in for a toss'
p4762
aS'why'
p4763
aS'because the exams are approaching and i am sure you must be feeling this way'
p4764
aS'but friends i am there with you in your moment of crisis'
p4765
aS'this is an important occasion for you hence i am there to offer my support'
p4766
aS'i am not here to lecture you i intend to have some light conversations with you'
p4767
aS'you have been studying hard and you are tired'
p4768
aS'mother scolds you and so does your father and teachers'
p4769
aS'god only knows what all you have to hear day in and out'
p4770
aS'keep the phone switch off the tv entire day you are glued to the computer- everyday you must be hearing the same things'
p4771
aS'be it the class x or the class xii the whole year long you might be getting to hear the same things'
p4772
aS'and you might be sincerely wishing that sooner the exams finish better it will be isnt it'
p4773
aS'i understand your mental condition and hence i am here to share mann ki baat with you'
p4774
aS'but this topic is a little difficult'
p4775
aS'as far as todays topic is concerned the parents might be wishing that i touch those issues that they can not discuss with their children'
p4776
aS'teachers must be wishing that i say the right things to the kids and the students might be wishing that i say things which might ease the pressure at home'
p4777
aS'i do not know who will benefit from my conversation but i will have the satisfaction to know that i was there with my young friends in the most important occasion of their life that i was sharing my inner feelings with them'
p4778
aS'this is my idea behind the conversations'
p4779
aS'i do not have the right to guide you on how to write a paper or how to pass the exams well'
p4780
aS'i can not guide you on the tricks to obtain better marks because i consider myself an average student on such issues'
p4781
aS'i have myself never scored well in any exams in my life'
p4782
aS'i was a very average student and on top of that i had a very bad handwriting'
p4783
aS'so i think that most of the time i passed the exams as the teachers could not comprehend my handwriting'
p4784
aS'well so much for the light talks'
p4785
aS'but today i want to definitely tell you something important'
p4786
aS'how you approach exams goes a long way in deciding the results of your exams'
p4787
aS'there are many people i have seen who view this as the most important challenge of their lives and they believe that a failure here means failure for life'
p4788
aS'but friends this is not so and so dont take undue stress'
p4789
aS'yes you must be determined to get good results'
p4790
aS'the determination should be strong and the motivation high'
p4791
aS'but the exams should not be a burden'
p4792
aS'this is not the exam which is going to test your performance in life'
p4793
aS'so do not bother much about it'
p4794
aS'sometimes dont you think we tend to make exams a huge burden and the reason behind this is that if we have friends and relatives who have children studying in the same class as your child if your child and your relatives child are also in class tenth then there is constant comparison'
p4795
aS'there is a feeling that our child should fare better than everyone elses child even your friends child'
p4796
aS'and it is this constant comparison that creates a pressure on your child'
p4797
aS'you feel that your child earns a name amongst the family and friends'
p4798
aS'but is it really his name or your own prestige that you are worried about'
p4799
aS'dont you feel that you are the one responsible for making your child a part of an undue competition'
p4800
aS'cant we associate him to larger vision and greater meaning of life'
p4801
aS'how does he cope with the competition to be same as your neighbors friend circle'
p4802
aS'and is this really what you want'
p4803
aS'just give s thought on it'
p4804
aS'just think in trying to compete with others how you have belittle your own childs life'
p4805
aS'is it fair'
p4806
aS'when you talk to children talk about big dreams talk of greater heights that can be achieved and you will see a change happening'
p4807
aS'friends there is something that always bothers us'
p4808
aS'we always measure our success in comparison to others'
p4809
aS'our entire energy is spent in useless competition'
p4810
aS'there are many points in life where competition is necessary but for self development competition with others might not be a good motivator but competing with oneself each day should be the primary motivation'
p4811
aS'so start competing with yourself compete with yourself to do better to do faster to do more and to reach new heights'
p4812
aS'concentrate on compete with yourself to make today better than the past'
p4813
aS'and you will find that this spirit of competition will give you such a lot of joy and satisfaction that you yourself cant imagine'
p4814
aS'we remember the athlete sergei bubka very fondly'
p4815
aS'this athlete broke his own records over 35 times'
p4816
aS'he would test himself only'
p4817
aS'every time he would set himself a new challenge and scale new heights'
p4818
aS'you also follow the same and then see that nothing can stop you from achieving success'
p4819
aS'dear friends even students are of different types'
p4820
aS'some people irrespective of the exams they may face they are always happy about it while some just collapse under the burden of exams'
p4821
aS'and some keep hiding behind the books in some corner of the house'
p4822
aS'but despite the type exams are still exams and it is necessary to pass in them and i also wish that you pass well'
p4823
aS'but sometimes you must have noticed that we are seeking some causes externally'
p4824
aS'we seek reasons outside when we are confused about ourselves'
p4825
aS'we do not have faith in ourselves as if we are giving some exam for the first time'
p4826
aS'if someone is watching tv and the pitch is loud we get irritated'
p4827
aS'if the mother calls for food we are irritated but at the same time if our friend calls up we end up chatting for an hour'
p4828
aS'dont you think that you have some confusion about yourself'
p4829
aS'friends it is important for you to identify yourself'
p4830
aS'just keep doing simple things you do need to go far'
p4831
aS'if you have a sister or your friend has a sister and who is appearing in x or xii standard exam just observe them'
p4832
aS'you will see whether it is x or xii the girls will definitely help the mothers in the household chores'
p4833
aS'have you ever thought that how do they manage to do work and yet score well in exams'
p4834
aS'nowadays the girls are far ahead of boys in examination results'
p4835
aS'just observe this around you'
p4836
aS'this will make you realize that issues that bother you are not external'
p4837
aS'sometimes the reasons are internal'
p4838
aS'if you are in self doubt then confidence can not help'
p4839
aS'and that is why i say that as confidence dips blind faith starts to envelope us and we then start seeking excuses outside'
p4840
aS'some students are such that we call them aarambhishura'
p4841
aS'everyday a new thought everyday a new desire everyday a new resolution and then this resolution dies an early death and we are left where we started'
p4842
aS'i clearly believe that these ever changing desires are called whims by the people'
p4843
aS'friend family and relatives make fun of you and hence i would suggest that you have fixed desires'
p4844
aS'these desires in turn will become resolutions'
p4845
aS'and resolutions can never be futile'
p4846
aS'resolutions are accompanied by goals'
p4847
aS'and when goals and action come together resolutions are achieved'
p4848
aS'that is why i say desire stability resolution'
p4849
aS'resolution action achievements'
p4850
aS'i have complete faith that in your life too achievements will be at your feet if only you dedicate yourself'
p4851
aS'dedicate yourself to your commitment and keep it positive'
p4852
aS'dont be bothered about defeating others'
p4853
aS'think of taking yourself further from where you already are'
p4854
aS'and so test yourself everyday against your own limits so that however big a challenge in life comes we will not have any problem'
p4855
aS'and why should someone else take our exam'
p4856
aS'make it a habit to take your exam yourself'
p4857
aS'each day we will test ourselves'
p4858
aS'we will see if we have progressed from where we were yesterday'
p4859
aS'have i reached further than yesterday have i achieved more than what i achieved yesterday'
p4860
aS'each day every moment keep testing yourself'
p4861
aS'then such tests will bother you no more in life'
p4862
aS'every exam will be an opportunity to test and regulate oneself and someone who can regulate himself knows to face challenges boldly'
p4863
aS'and so who sets himself challenges of life finds these classroom exams very small'
p4864
aS'sometimes we far exceed our own expectations'
p4865
aS'just try and remember the good works that you have done'
p4866
aS'you will be surprised at your own achievement'
p4867
aS'last year you were sick and yet you got good marks'
p4868
aS'last year your uncle got married one full week got wasted but still you managed to score very well'
p4869
aS'earlier you would sleep for six hours and then last year you decided you will sleep for only five hours and you did it'
p4870
aS'what advice can modi give you'
p4871
aS'you become your own advisor and as lord buddha said uppa deepo bhavahah'
p4872
aS'it is my belief that one should recognize ones inner light recognize ones potential'
p4873
aS'those who set themselves a new limit each time are the ones who scale greater heights'
p4874
aS'secondly sometimes we are busy thinking about the distant future'
p4875
aS'some people live in the past'
p4876
aS'dont do so during your exams'
p4877
aS'during examinations it is better to be in the present'
p4878
aS'does a batsman anytime try and recall when he was out for a duck'
p4879
aS'or does he think whether we will win this entire series or not'
p4880
aS'once he enters a match does he think that i will come out only after hitting a century'
p4881
aS'not really'
p4882
aS'in my opinion a good batsman is focused on the ball he is facing'
p4883
aS'he does not think of the next ball or of the match or of entire series'
p4884
aS'you also fix your mind in the present'
p4885
aS'to win there is only one formula'
p4886
aS'live in the present connect with the present'
p4887
aS'victory will be yours'
p4888
aS'my dear friends do you think exams are meant to exhibit your capacity'
p4889
aS'if this is what you think then you are wrong'
p4890
aS'who do you have to show your capacity'
p4891
aS'who do you need to demonstrate it to'
p4892
aS'you should think that these exams are not to demonstrate your capacity but to realize your own potential'
p4893
aS'if you make this basic mantra your calling your confidence will get a new boost'
p4894
aS'once you realize your potential and understand yourself then you yourself will keep fostering your strengths this strength will translate into a new potential and so dont take exams as a medium of exhibition take it as an opportunity'
p4895
aS'this is an opportunity to know oneself to explore oneself and to be living with oneself'
p4896
aS'so live on my friends'
p4897
aS'friends i have seen that there are many students who become nervous during exams'
p4898
aS'some go to the extent that look today was my exam and mama did not even wish me'
p4899
aS'uncle did not wish me and elder brother did not wish me'
p4900
aS'and probably this issue is debated for an hour or two in the family- who did not wish who called up to wish did he send flowers or not'
p4901
aS'friends rise above all this do not get involved in all this'
p4902
aS'think about all this when exams are over'
p4903
aS'if you have faith in yourself then such things will not arise'
p4904
aS'i have seen that many students become nervous'
p4905
aS'i know that some people have the tendency to become nervous'
p4906
aS'some families have such an environment'
p4907
aS'i believe that the reason for nervousness is the lack of faith in oneself'
p4908
aS'how do you get this faith in yourself- if you gain mastery in your subject you have worked hard and have done multiple revisions'
p4909
aS'if you have the confidence that you have mastery in some subject you will see that out of the 5-7 subjects there are only 2-3 topics for which you are never worried'
p4910
aS'nervousness is about some one or two topics'
p4911
aS'if you have mastered the subject you will not be nervous'
p4912
aS'all the hard work that you have done in the past year all those books that you have studied through the night they will not go waste'
p4913
aS'it will be there somewhere in your mind'
p4914
aS'as soon as you sit on your examination desk it will come back to you'
p4915
aS'you should trust your knowledge your information'
p4916
aS'have the faith that all the hard work you have done will certainly bear fruit and secondly be confident about your strengths'
p4917
aS'you should have the faith that however difficult the exam is you will crack it successfully'
p4918
aS'however lengthy the exam is i will successfully complete it'
p4919
aS'you should be confident about the timing be it a two hour or a three hour paper that you will finish it before time'
p4920
aS'i still remember maybe you have been told too our teachers instructed us to do easy questions first and tackle the difficult ones later'
p4921
aS'i believe someone must have told you the same and i believe that you will follow it'
p4922
aS'friends i have received many suggestions and experiences on mygov'
p4923
aS'in'
p4924
aS'i will pass them on to the education ministry but i would like to mention a few things here'
p4925
aS'arnav mohta writes from mumbai maharashtra that some people make these exams an issue of life and death'
p4926
aS'as if entire world will finish if one fails these exams'
p4927
aS'vinita tiwari writes from varanasi that the news of children committing suicide on the declaration of these results saddens her'
p4928
aS'you too must be hearing such news but i have got good response from it from another gentleman'
p4929
aS'mr r kamath has send in some good words'
p4930
aS'he has asked the students not to become worriers but warriors'
p4931
aS'really we should not sink in worries but should be a warrior in the battlefield'
p4932
aS'i believe that we should not drown in our worries we should march ahead with the belief that victory will be ours'
p4933
aS'life is very long'
p4934
aS'there are ups and downs but one should not perish with them'
p4935
aS'sometimes unwanted results are an indication to move forward'
p4936
aS'they give us the opportunity to find new strength'
p4937
aS'i have also witnessed another thing'
p4938
aS'students as soon as they are out of the examination hall they start estimating how they fared'
p4939
aS'friends and family too ask the same question'
p4940
aS'how was todays paper'
p4941
aS'whatever is finished is over please forget about it'
p4942
aS'i would also request the parents not to ask such questions'
p4943
aS'as soon as he gets out say oh the glow on your face says that you have done well'
p4944
aS'ok good'
p4945
aS'let us go and prepare for tomorrow'
p4946
aS'create this mood and friends i also tell you what will be the impact if you calculate and come to know that two questions are wrong and you would lose 6 marks then tell me will it not impact your performance the other day'
p4947
aS'so why waste time on this'
p4948
aS'why waste your energy on this'
p4949
aS'after all the exams are over whatever calculations you want to make you are free to do them'
p4950
aS'how many marks will be scored that should not be your concern at the time of exams'
p4951
aS'after the paper finishes concentrate on the next days paper forget the days paper and you will see your burden lessening by 20-25'
p4952
aS'quite a few thoughts are rising in my mind'
p4953
aS'i do not know if they will be useful now that the exams are near'
p4954
aS'but i would like to tell my educator and academician friends that cant we celebrate a week long exam festival twice in a year in each term'
p4955
aS'it should have a sarcastic poetry session or a cartoon competition a debate competition'
p4956
aS'there should be someone to lecture on the psychological aspects of exams so that this tension around the exams gets eliminated'
p4957
aS'if exams become a celebration then the students would not need to spend time like the way they are doing today in hearing this out'
p4958
aS'the students will themselves become confident'
p4959
aS'also i believe that while teaching the syllabus a separate lecture should be conducted on topics pertaining to exams'
p4960
aS'this environment of tension is not conducive'
p4961
aS'friends i know that whatever i am telling you you must have heard a lot more than that'
p4962
aS'your parents must have lectured you so must have the teachers'
p4963
aS'i do not want to confuse you by talking more on this subject'
p4964
aS'i want to believe that all the sons and daughters of this land who are going to give exams remain happy and joyful and give exams with a free mind'
p4965
aS'i am talking to make you happy'
p4966
aS'you will get good results'
p4967
aS'you will be successful make exams a celebration give exams in a joyful mood enjoy achievement each day and change the entire atmosphere'
p4968
aS'parents teachers and school all should get together and experience what it is like to challenge the challenges how wonderful it feels to convert each moment into an opportunity'
p4969
aS'and remember you can not please everyone in the world'
p4970
aS'i had a penchant for writing poetry i had written a poem in gujarati i dont remember it fully but i had written in it- if successful then you are worth being envious of if failed then you are nowhere'
p4971
aS'this is the way of the world'
p4972
aS'be successful not to defeat others but to overcome your challenges be successful for your own pleasure'
p4973
aS'be successful for bringing pleasure to the lives of those others living in this world'
p4974
aS'i have this faith that you will succeed with happiness in your heart'
p4975
aS'you will have great success'
p4976
aS'and then whether we could celebrate holi or not whether we could attend uncles marriage or not whether i could attend friends birthday party or not could see the cricket world cup or not- all these things will become immaterial as for now your dimensions of happiness will be very different'
p4977
aS'my best wishes to you'
p4978
aS'nations future is as bright as your own future'
p4979
aS'indias future will be defined by indias youth it will be defined by you'
p4980
aS'be it the sons or daughters both have to work in tandem to take the country forward'
p4981
aS'come make the exam festival into a celebration'
p4982
aS'my best wishes to you'
p4983
ag449
ag449
aS'honourable chairman sir we had a detailed discussion on the motion of thanks to the honourable presidents address'
p4984
aS'i am also here to reply to the honourable presidents address and with a request for this house to pass this motion of thanks to horourable presidents address with a consensus'
p4985
aS'all the honourable members have communicated their ideas in detail during the discussion'
p4986
aS'i am grateful to all'
p4987
aS'this is a fact that this house is a council of states'
p4988
aS'there are lots of members amongst us who have represented a particular state and during their time of representing that state public mood was somewhat different than what it is today in the prevailing situation'
p4989
aS'now the political situations have changed'
p4990
aS'people have changed their decision'
p4991
aS'and in that sense from the perspective of council of states the representation of the sentiments of the people of those states representation of the sentiments of the government of those states which the people have elected is a must and this is natural as well'
p4992
aS'what is more important is the state which we represent rather than the party we are representing and it is our responsibility to represent the state in the position in which it is today'
p4993
aS'and in that sense this house will definitely honor the public opinion'
p4994
aS'the people have given mandate with a great expectation to run the government and although scope for criticism and arguments is always there it is our collective responsibility to cooperate with each other for the betterment of our country and i believe that we will not go back in carrying forward this collective responsibility'
p4995
aS'secondly threats have neither worked nor will work in democracy'
p4996
aS'i used to receive many letters for 14 years threatening to put me in jail but here i am standing in front of you today'
p4997
aS'i am well aware of those games but i do not want to speak on those'
p4998
aS'it is going to be embedded in the pages of history'
p4999
aS'and therefore everybody knows about the character of the people who use threat as a tool'
p5000
aS'in the same democracy during the emergency we are aware of kind of oppression was done'
p5001
aS'is there any bigger threat than that but the country refused to bow down to those threats'
p5002
aS'therefore please do not put words which were never said in someones mouth'
p5003
aS'the country should run according to the existing laws and within the ambit of existing laws'
p5004
aS'and lot of members in this house have same objection that we are just promoting the old schemes with new names'
p5005
aS'i said that in the other assembly and i am repeating it here that this debate that schemes are new or old will drift us further apart'
p5006
aS'the issue is that problems are long-standing'
p5007
aS'the real worry is about the problems and finding solutions to the problems'
p5008
aS'and we dont believe that we are the only experts to resolve these issues'
p5009
aS'we do not have the thinking that since we are sitting in this position so god is bestowed us with complete knowledge'
p5010
aS'we too have several drawbacks'
p5011
aS'but by coming together we can solve the problems'
p5012
aS'and this is the strength of democracy'
p5013
aS'nobody can claim to be complete'
p5014
aS'but if we come together there is quite a possibility of being complete'
p5015
aS'but if god is not willing still there can be some shortcomings in overcoming the problems and hence our thought is that we alone can not achieve everything'
p5016
aS'therefore may be this assembly has never heard before and probably it is my true statement that never ever any member of this house would have heard while having control on treasury bank they have praised and acknowledged the contribution of others for their role in the development of this country'
p5017
aS'how can they acknowledge role of others in the development of nation when they are not willing to give anyone credit in freedom movement'
p5018
aS'but it was me who announced from red fort that this country has move forward due to the contribution extended by all previous governments prime ministers and state governments'
p5019
aS'you can refer to my old speech delivered in this house only wherein i had affirmed these words with great responsibility and pride'
p5020
aS'we dont believe that the country came into existence on 15 august 1947'
p5021
aS'this country is legacy of thousands of years'
p5022
aS'this country has been in existence owing to it sages saints teachers workers and farmers and not by governments'
p5023
aS'governments will keep changing'
p5024
aS'people like us will come run the system and the leave'
p5025
aS'and therefore i request you to please do not force us to live as per your approach or as per the thought process which is within you which you have lived with'
p5026
aS'please do not force us to live with the perspective you have lived with which we have never followed and please do not try to test us with the same approach as you used to do'
p5027
aS'you said that i am just limited to explaining the schemes'
p5028
aS'i can go further even up to till the years of 84-86 but i will not waste that much time'
p5029
aS'at the time of nda government there was a scheme named multipurpose national identity project'
p5030
aS'you brought aadhar uidai it was the same scheme with a new name'
p5031
aS'during atal iis time there was sampoorna grameen rojgaar yojna you brought mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act'
p5032
aS'during atal jis time there was freedom of information act you brought right to information act'
p5033
aS'during atal jis time there was antodaya ann yojna you brought national food security act'
p5034
aS'during atal jis time there was sarv shiksha abhiyaan post 86th constitutional amendment you brought right of children to free and compulsory education act'
p5035
aS'during atal jis time there was swarnim jayanti gram swaraj yojna you brought national rural livelihoods mission'
p5036
aS'during atal jis time there was total sanitation campaign you brought nirmal bharat abhiyan'
p5037
aS'during atal jis time there was insurance regulatory and development authority you brought pension fund regulatory and development authority act'
p5038
aS'honorable chairman sir there were some political talks here as well'
p5039
aS'i heard talks like who is he who are they or how many'
p5040
aS'i would like to draw the attention of this house toward this issue'
p5041
aS'in political life taking decisions on mere perception always has chances of errors and you know where you have reached by doing so'
p5042
aS'and therefore it is very important to understand the ground realities in political life'
p5043
aS'we can not move on the basis of perception only'
p5044
aS'i just heard venkaiah ji saying that majority of farmers and dalits etc'
p5045
aS'are with us'
p5046
aS'today on one hand bjp represents ladakh on the other hand it represents kanyakumari'
p5047
aS'if it represents kutch on one side the other side it represents arunachal pradesh'
p5048
aS'and therefore you can see bjp representing the regions across kutch to kanyakumari'
p5049
aS'earlier they used to think that we are limited to hindi belt only but today you can see that we have successfully formed government in southern india also'
p5050
aS'we also know that we have been accused of being party of upper classes only but after seeing me you must have to change your thinking'
p5051
aS'there are few states with highest tribal population like maharashtra madhya pradesh chhattisgarh jharkhand rajasthan and gujarat'
p5052
aS'and the tribal society of these states have voted for bhartiya janata party'
p5053
aS'you also know that goa where decisive voters are from christian society bjp is ruling there with full majority'
p5054
aS'nagaland where maximum voters belong to christian society is having bjp government'
p5055
aS'jammu kashmir where decisive voters are muslims is having bjp government'
p5056
aS'punjab with majority of sikh community as decision makers also has our government from so many years'
p5057
aS'so these are the regions being ruled by bjp and therefore ground reality must be considered that now bjp has emerged as a party which is widely acceptable across different regions'
p5058
aS'and therefore the perception based on which you are bringing your point forward is the thing of the past'
p5059
aS'we are well aware of the era when the ancestors of our sitaram ji used to tell people that that vehicle which is running on your blood and not running on petrol'
p5060
aS'we have heard such dialogues long ago'
p5061
aS'so do we need to pay attention to these kinds of dialogues in todays world'
p5062
aS'time has changed and therefore i wanted to ask this'
p5063
aS'i am thankful to sharad ji that he has delivered what i have been thinking'
p5064
aS'and please spare some time to read my book namely samajik samrasta'
p5065
aS'i have explained your emotions in detail and you will be quite happy to read it'
p5066
aS'i am not saying that you will also enjoy the same happiness'
p5067
aS'i totally acknowledge what sharad ji said'
p5068
aS'is the sanitation campaign is a program for corporate sector or for rich people only'
p5069
aS'the poor society of india living in huts is craving for quality of life'
p5070
aS'cant we provide them hygienic atmosphere'
p5071
aS'and therefore i think of them when i run such campaigns'
p5072
aS'i talk about honour of our mothers and sisters'
p5073
aS'due to jan dhan yojana poor people are able to open their bank accounts'
p5074
aS'is this a corporate program'
p5075
aS'this program is not associated with rich people or corporate world'
p5076
aS'the issue of toilets in schools which schools are covered under this programme'
p5077
aS'the schools where poor children are studying for example a drivers son goes to this type of school'
p5078
aS'there are no toilets'
p5079
aS'i am working hard to resolve this issue'
p5080
aS'is this a program for rich people or corporate world'
p5081
aS'i talk about soil health card'
p5082
aS'who are covered under it'
p5083
aS'poor farmers having small piece of land'
p5084
aS'i talk about per dropmore crop'
p5085
aS'why'
p5086
aS'since he is a small farmer and is having small piece of land'
p5087
aS'how can he produce more crops'
p5088
aS'i am working hard in this direction'
p5089
aS'is this a program for corporate world'
p5090
aS'will rich people make money from it'
p5091
aS'we auction coal blocks to earn money'
p5092
aS'the eastern belt of india is full of natural resources'
p5093
aS'be it bihar jharkhand west bengal assam poorvanchal - these states are full of natural resources take orissa despite having so much natural resources is not able to come out of poverty'
p5094
aS'shouldnt we try to improve take them out of poverty'
p5095
aS'is the western part is the only part entitled for development'
p5096
aS'i am pained that country can not move further until balanced development is done in all regions'
p5097
aS'so the money generated from coal auction will be used in the upliftment of the states who are in possession of coal'
p5098
aS'this will give the poor a chance to fight against poverty and will help the states to develop'
p5099
aS'is this happening for the rich'
p5100
aS'is this taking place for the corporate world'
p5101
aS'clean ganga 40 percent of the countrys population is directly or indirectly financially connected with the river ganga'
p5102
aS'for some cleaning ganga would be a matter of devotion'
p5103
aS'for some it would be an environmental issue but cleaning ganga is also a massive economic programme on the whole'
p5104
aS'it has the strength to awaken the country financially'
p5105
aS'this can help the poor to bring a change in their lives financially'
p5106
aS'this government is only determined to serve the dejected poor class of the society'
p5107
aS'skill india anand ji was sharing the facts i dont intend to share the same and various committees were formed various missions were set many came and many left i dont want to talk about this but all the successful countries too are focussing and working towards the goal of skill development'
p5108
aS'it is our responsibility that we use our demographic dividend in the most appropriate manner'
p5109
aS'if we have the demographic dividend we have the hands but we also need skills along with the hands'
p5110
aS'having mere hands will not serve the purpose we need hands with proper skills'
p5111
aS'i believe if the youths of our country have skills it can act as a strengthening catalyst for reaching new heights in the country'
p5112
aS'therefore we are focussing on the poor children who have left their studies after 5th or 3rd grade should be provided with skill development programme'
p5113
aS'housing for all who are these people who do not have houses to live in'
p5114
aS'are they corporates'
p5115
aS'these people are none other than the poor citizens of our country'
p5116
aS'we are trying to provide them houses by building 3 crore houses in the villages and 2 crore houses in the cities by the year 2022 when we will celebrate the pure indian independence'
p5117
aS'we will always move forward to make to dream come true'
p5118
aS'there is no requirement of any political agenda for making this dream true we will also ask the congress rulers to support us in this venture and provide houses to the poor'
p5119
aS'this venture is not a part of government programme but this is a programme for the poor citizens of our country'
p5120
aS'therefore we are focussing on this problem'
p5121
aS'i am sure you all will support us in moving forward with the goal of upliftment of the poor'
p5122
aS'we all can see that intelligent people do different analysis but in our entire budget 42 percent devolution is for the states that comprise indian economy we need to think about them'
p5123
aS'when we speak of the development of nation it is high time to combine the states and nations riches and its time to see the policies in a perspective'
p5124
aS'you are the representatives of the state'
p5125
aS'this is the council of states where huge devolution has been provided'
p5126
aS'once the money is utilised in the infrastructure and development of the state it will lead to economy generation'
p5127
aS'i would like to request all the respected representatives of the states to utilise any huge amount of money in the right direction of development of the state which will help the state to develop on the whole and bring an end to all the problems'
p5128
aS'we have come up with a new mudra micro units development and refinancing agency scheme in our current budget'
p5129
aS'we want to know that who runs the economy in our country in reality'
p5130
aS'we have not researched on this issue'
p5131
aS'the common men of this country are the one who provide jobs perform jobs as well as run our countrys economy'
p5132
aS'we have the auto-drivers auto rickshaw repairer auto rickshaw owner scooter repairer cycle repairer boot polisher fruits seller bread seller and many more'
p5133
aS'these are all common men of our country who provide 5'
p5134
aS'5 crore jobs to the poor and 11-12 crore jobs on the whole'
p5135
aS'this is not a small amount'
p5136
aS'they have the capability to provide jobs to people'
p5137
aS'but it is highly disappointing to see that there is no organization from where these sectors can take funds if required'
p5138
aS'they borrow money from the money lenders on 120 interest and spend half of their lives in paying the interest'
p5139
aS'for the first time our government has formulated mudra scheme wherein these sectors will be benefited with funds with institutional arrangements and they will be able to develop themselves financially'
p5140
aS'i believe other factors related to financial development will also be affected by this new scheme and will lead the nation to new heights'
p5141
aS'who are these people'
p5142
aS'about 54 percent of the population are conducting small scale business in the rural sectors'
p5143
aS'46 percent of the population are running their business in the cities'
p5144
aS'more than 60 percent of those who are involved in these businesses are scheduled caste or schedules tribe or obc'
p5145
aS'this implies that if we try to focus on this backward sector of the society i believe that they can move ahead in their development at a very high pace'
p5146
aS'we are trying to provide jobs to these backward sector of the society'
p5147
aS'till now the institutional finance which have been provided to them'
p5148
ag449
aS'respected chairman sir this assembly comprises of all the senior citizens'
p5149
aS'these citizens are much more experienced hard-working and have contributed a lot towards the development of our nation'
p5150
aS'i am quite new in this assembly thereby requesting you to assist me in this situation'
p5151
aS'respected chairman sir out of 125 crore of population 29 crore citizens have life insurance policy'
p5152
aS'only 10 crore citizens have accidental death cover insurance'
p5153
aS'only 6 crore citizens have the organized pension scheme cover'
p5154
aS'other than this under the bpl category a widow or any other senior citizen has the pension scheme ranging from 300 inr to 1500 inr'
p5155
aS'this is a very common scheme in our wide nation'
p5156
aS'we are trying ways to find a solution to a very big problem in our country'
p5157
aS'and i believe we are trying to reach all the sections of our society with the help of prime minister safety insurance scheme prime minister life of light scheme and atal pension scheme'
p5158
aS'we are planning to simplify these schemes'
p5159
aS'with one rupee every month and for citizens under the age group of 18 to 70 years we can generate accidental death cover insurance of 2 lakh rupees'
p5160
aS'i believe considering the present scenario of our nation we are worried about poor citizens of our country'
p5161
aS'under prime minister life of light scheme we can generate 330 rupees which is one rupee per day and citizens under the age group of 18 to 50 years can use the benefits of this insurance without any medical tests'
p5162
aS'not only this rs'
p5163
aS'2 lakh risk coverage will be provided to the family in case of death under normal circumstances as well'
p5164
aS'atal pension scheme under this pension scheme after 60 years any citizen who requires a pension of one two three five thousand or any other amount this pension plan will work as per the pension amount required'
p5165
aS'if a 20 year old opts for this scheme and requires a pension amount of rs'
p5166
aS'5000 after 60 years then he is required to contribute rs'
p5167
aS'248 per year till the age of 60 and he can get the pension of rs'
p5168
aS'5000 per month throughout his life'
p5169
aS'in case of death his wife will be benefited with the pension amount'
p5170
aS'in case of death of both mother and father their children will be refunded the deposited amount of rs'
p5171
aS'8'
p5172
aS'5 lakh'
p5173
aS'our nations requirement of social security and its awareness will be fulfilled through this scheme'
p5174
aS'we have tried out best to uplift our society with the safety and satisfaction among the senior citizens in their last stages of life'
p5175
aS'our countrys farmers believe i slog day and night will get old and then will be eventually separated by our children'
p5176
aS'if i had pension'
p5177
ag449
ag449
aS'so with the help of this scheme even the farmers will be benefited housewives'
p5178
aS'so if children leave them in their old age or if they dont have children they can still continue to avail the benefits of this pension scheme'
p5179
aS'we have also come up with a new sovereign gold bond scheme'
p5180
aS'even after independence our golds hallmark is run through some or the other foreign hallmark'
p5181
aS'this is very disappointing that our country doesnt have its owngold hallmark'
p5182
aS'so with this sovereign gold bond we will have our own gold coins biscuits ashok chakra emblem and we can reach everywhere around the world'
p5183
aS'there are a few things which are directly connected to our dignity and self-respect which will act as a powerful weapon for our country'
p5184
aS'when we speak of sovereign gold bank and for example we speak of 20 thousand tonnes of gold this might lead anand sharma to stand up and narrate the quantity of gold mentioned by me'
p5185
aS'to this i would say this is just a way to speak'
p5186
aS'we are unable to use the available gold in our country gold monetization it is merely present as a dead money in our country'
p5187
aS'it will be a great driving force to uplift the nations economy with its circulation'
p5188
aS'so we are eliminating the policy of half kilo gold from our country'
p5189
aS'citizens can keep any amount of gold borrow money and go ahead in their lives'
p5190
aS'i believe with this venture a huge amount of gold in the form of dead money will provide an enormous boost to our nation'
p5191
aS'in the same manner we want to proceed with the sovereign gold bond'
p5192
aS'it is not mandatory to buy gold in the form of metal but you can also buy gold in the form of paper'
p5193
aS'eventually you will be refunded the amount according the present gold rate once you return the paper gold'
p5194
aS'this will also support in the import-export balance in our nation'
p5195
aS'i believe our country will be immensely benefited with this scheme'
p5196
aS'i believe a country requires good ideas and customs for positive development'
p5197
aS'we can not expect a positive outcome with just good ideas or just good customs'
p5198
aS'we need a combination of both ideas and customs which will lead the country to the path of upliftment'
p5199
aS'therefore we are striving to adopt and develop a work culture which will help us in achieving our goals'
p5200
aS'shri'
p5201
aS'ghulam nabi ji and shri anand ji have raised the issues of transfers of officers which is very disappointing'
p5202
aS'i am observing that people are so distressed just like a gram seed dries off in water'
p5203
aS'they are in great pain as they have been transferred'
p5204
aS'i would like to say that we should look into our own reflection in mirrors before giving such sermons'
p5205
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004'
p5206
aS'you had dismissed the cabinet secretary as soon as the government was formed'
p5207
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004'
p5208
aS'you had appointed foreign secretary without considering the convention of seniority'
p5209
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004'
p5210
aS'you had dismissed the home secretary straightaway'
p5211
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004'
p5212
aS'you had even dismissed the efficient defence secretary in one moment'
p5213
aS'not only this you had insulted the governors kept them in darkness and dismissed them'
p5214
aS'we havent done anything like this'
p5215
aS'i may address to ghulam nabi ji an ex- health minister wherein a secretary from your department had received a nobel prize from un for polio'
p5216
aS'you had dismissed him while he was receiving the award from un'
p5217
aS'so we need to decide what all can be revealed here in the assembly'
p5218
aS'even though i am new here i have a huge treasure of information with me'
p5219
aS'and therefore we have decided and we are keenly determined to move in the direction of good governance'
p5220
aS'one more fact has come up into consideration that we have received some from our supporters some from those who think positive of us and some from those who have special love for us'
p5221
aS'and i have received a lot of love from many of who have bestowed special love'
p5222
aS'we can see nothing on the ground'
p5223
aS'i really admire modi jis statements his way of thinking but i am unable to see any result on the grounds'
p5224
aS'i would like to say to my supporters that you have been in government for ages and are intoxicated with power'
p5225
aS'i pray to god to save all of us from that intoxication of power'
p5226
aS'as when we are addicted to power the addiction becomes quite high so when the head is quite high above the ground we are unable to look down and see the ground level'
p5227
aS'i believe the more you look down the more you connect with people so i would like the people here who have asked about ground to understand how the work is done'
p5228
aS'railways and highways both are run by the government'
p5229
aS'however there has always been a clash between the two as the railways would never allow more than 350 projects of highways and the latter would never give permissions to railways for more projects'
p5230
aS'some need to build a railway line across the road line and some need to build an over bridge across the railway line'
p5231
aS'there were 350 projects we came and we noticed and asked both the departments to sit across the table and clear all the misunderstandings and got a mou signed between the two and today i am happy to announce that we have introduced an online portal for the same'
p5232
aS'online clearances are now being provided'
p5233
aS'the projects which were stuck in these departments for the past 350 years stand all clear now'
p5234
aS'now if any new project is undertaken it has been decided to clear the same within 60 days'
p5235
aS'at present we have just 22 projects in hand which are under process'
p5236
aS'this is a pure example of good governance and this is how a work is done'
p5237
aS'let me give you the details of the work done on the grounds'
p5238
aS'i will speak of the upa first wherein 7'
p5239
aS'4 km per day of highway were awarded but only 5'
p5240
aS'2 km per day used to be achieved'
p5241
aS'anand ji let me give you the accounts of work done within 9 months now'
p5242
aS'we award the work of 18 km per day and we have received the reports that we achieve 10'
p5243
aS'1 km per day'
p5244
aS'its double and this is how a work is done and government can run on the ground level'
p5245
aS'railway 2013-14-new line- upa- 390 km'
p5246
aS'new line- 9 months- nda 2410 km'
p5247
aS'2013-14 - gauge conversion - 585 km'
p5248
aS'our 9 months - 700 km'
p5249
aS'upa - doubling - 675 km'
p5250
aS'our - 810 km'
p5251
aS'i am trying to convey that we are connected to the grounds of our country and i am sure you will be able to see the results on the ground through our work'
p5252
aS'adarsh gram scheme i would like to convey my special gratitude and appreciate the work of few respected members of the parliament'
p5253
aS'about 600 members have joined hands and supported in this work with all their hearts'
p5254
aS'i have been informed i love to speak about people in this way especially if i have to speak of our respected motilal ji veera he has done a tremendous work in a village called mohali chhatisgarh'
p5255
aS'he took initiatives to open jan dhan accounts for all the ration card holders connected the people with aadhaar cards built committees for safeguarding government distribution so that the poor can be benefited through pds system'
p5256
aS'respected motilal ji has worked on these important grounds'
p5257
aS'so if the members of the parliament take such initiatives and interests it can help the villages to transform with a new developed shape'
p5258
aS'i have all the information about the members'
p5259
aS'i would like to mention the name of our member kamakhya prasad from jorhat who has come up with perfect safety schemes for icds and mid-day meals so that the children can get proper meals'
p5260
aS'our own aviation minister shri ashok ji who has adopted a village in andhra pradesh took a pledge and surrendered himself to eliminate the prevailing alcohol intake in the village'
p5261
aS'the village members were used to drinking alcohol and have the licence for alcohol shops'
p5262
aS'if we have the support of all the members we have move forward in the path of good governance and achieve our goals'
p5263
aS'you must be aware of the labour practices wherein our labourers who had slogged day and night and should be allotted the amount of rs'
p5264
aS'27000 crores which is not a small amount but they are unable to receive the amount'
p5265
aS'why'
p5266
aS'as some labourers are paid just rs'
p5267
aS'50 rs'
p5268
aS'100 or rs'
p5269
aS'200 and they can not stick to just one place for work'
p5270
aS'if he relocates to some other workplace he has to bear extra fare for reaching the old workplace for receiving the payment of rs'
p5271
aS'50 or rs 100'
p5272
aS'there are no accounts of the labourers who died for any reason'
p5273
aS'there is no proper account of their payments and our government treasury has rs'
p5274
aS'27000 crores which belongs to the labourers'
p5275
aS'we have tried to formulate the uan universal account number policy'
p5276
aS'with the help of this uan policy labourers will be receiving their payments in their accounts irrespective of their location'
p5277
aS'with this the labourers will be able to receive their pending amount of payment from the treasury of rs'
p5278
aS'27000 crore which is lying with the government'
p5279
aS'this money belongs to the poor and is it their rightful money'
p5280
aS'the government doesnt want to use this money for any other cause we want to pay the money back to the labourers'
p5281
aS'i believe this is a result of good governance and will have a positive impact in the development of our nation'
p5282
aS'if we speak of prime minister peoples money i dont want to take much of your time for discussing the same'
p5283
aS'we have been discussing mnrega repeatedly'
p5284
aS'what i spoke in the last assembly i would not be repeating the same here as that has been registered appropriately and has been addressed'
p5285
aS'now i would like to talk about aadhaar cards and mnrega'
p5286
aS'i dont want to criticize and make comparison between them'
p5287
aS'but i have the strength and culture to say that all our governments have contributed to the development of our nation'
p5288
aS'our country must have faced various obstacles in reaching what we are today nonetheless huge contributions have been done'
p5289
aS'let us speak of the working of aadhaar cards in 45 months under upa which is almost 3'
p5290
aS'5 years 7 crore aadhaar settlements took place'
p5291
aS'in 9 months under nda 17 crore settlements took place'
p5292
aS'so we can see the difference between 45 months and 9 months'
p5293
aS'you have to compare between 45 months and 9 months'
p5294
aS'in 45 months of upa government 5000 aadhar cards were linked with mnrega'
p5295
aS'and at the time nda government 8 lac aadhar cards have been linked with this scheme'
p5296
aS'now compare 5000 in 45 months versus 8 lakhs in just 9 months'
p5297
aS'at the time of upa 1'
p5298
aS'7 crore aadhar cards were linked with job cards'
p5299
aS'we have added 5 crore people in 9 months'
p5300
aS'compare 1'
p5301
aS'7 crores versus 5 crores'
p5302
aS'and therefore i said that both policy and practices needs to be developed'
p5303
aS'we talk about mnrega and job guarantee for 100 days for poor people'
p5304
aS'during 2013-14 average days of employment under this scheme were 42'
p5305
aS'5 days only which is well short of 50'
p5306
aS'and how many persons got jobs for 100 days during 2013-14'
p5307
aS'only 6'
p5308
aS'35'
p5309
aS'and when this issue was brought to the notice of honorable supreme court it was admitted by upa government that they have no audit report for the expenses incurred amounting to rs'
p5310
aS'1 lakh crore in the last five years in mnrega'
p5311
aS'this affidavit has been filed by you in supreme court'
p5312
aS'we talk a lot about plans discussions related to it credit rules and strict laws'
p5313
aS'nation wants us to do the best for the benefit of poor people and try to improve the life style of a common man'
p5314
aS'and you will see that in 9 months that the government is working in the same direction'
p5315
aS'respected mayawati ji has discussed about bundelkhand'
p5316
aS'bundelkhand is divided into two states madhya pradesh uttar pradesh'
p5317
aS'an amount of rs'
p5318
aS'3760 crore was disbursed for six districts of madhya pradesh'
p5319
aS'at the same time an amount of rs'
p5320
aS'3506 crore was disbursed for seven districts of uttar pradesh'
p5321
aS'madhya pradesh spent 96 amount out of it and you can see the results'

p5325
aS'around 561 milk cooperative societies have been initiated'
p5326
aS'drinking water consumption has improved from 40 litres per person to 55 litres'
p5327
aS'since you belong to uttar pradesh i would not like to share the progress report for the bundelkhand connected to uttar pradesh'
p5328
aS'maybe your concern is quite genuine but i have shared the facts about other part connected to madhya pradesh'
p5329
aS'we had a discussion on bengal also'
p5330
aS'there are some people who are trying to run this country with imported ideology'
p5331
aS'they ruled the bengal for 30 years'
p5332
aS'but derek i wont blame you for the current situation'
p5333
aS'you can do what you want but the cr should remain ok'
p5334
aS'in the past 30 years the image of west bengal which once was known as capital of industrial activity in india and kolkata which was once known as industrial capital has been completely destroyed'
p5335
aS'west bengal was one of the industrial development leaders for agricultural growth'
p5336
aS'in last 30 years agricultural growth is reduced to minus figures'
p5337
aS'west bengals share in industrial development is reduced to 4 from 10'
p5338
aS'during 1976-77 7'
p5339
aS'6 percent of total factories were running in bengal which was reduced to 4 in 2008-09'
p5340
aS'during 1966-76 industrial growth was 17'
p5341
aS'3 which was reduced to 7'
p5342
aS'8 during 2001-07'
p5343
aS'during 2007 national sample survey it was observed that bengal is the most affected state suffering from starvation'
p5344
aS'only 60 schools have functional toilets for girl compared to national average of 75'
p5345
aS'yesterday sitaram ji was discussing about closure of nokia factory in chennai'
p5346
aS'the nation wants us to create jobs and we have to try our best in this direction'
p5347
aS'to complete this task we have to promote make in india campaign'
p5348
aS'speed of infrastructure will decide job opportunities and to increase the job opportunities we should focus on infrastructure'
p5349
aS'yesterday shri sitarajm ji had shown concern for closure of nokia factory in chennai and for 25000 employees who lost their job'
p5350
aS'i would like to state that this factory was not closed down due to our governments policy'
p5351
aS'it has been closed due to certain steps taken by the previous government'
p5352
aS'i acknowledge your concern'
p5353
aS'yes 25000 employees have lost their job'
p5354
aS'but i would like to assure you that we have taken necessary steps'
p5355
aS'and we hope that nokia will resume shortly and jobs will be created'
p5356
aS'so we are already working in this direction'
p5357
aS'the president in his address has talked about digital india'
p5358
aS'honorable chairman sir it is true that once there was a global theory of haves and have nots'
p5359
aS'i believe that in the coming days digital divide could be one of the reasons for poverty and backwardness'
p5360
aS'therefore nation must not face the situation of digital divide'
p5361
aS'and to stop the digital divide we need to associate even the poorest of the poor with digital technology'
p5362
aS'india is having more than 90 crore mobile users and is likely to touch the 100 crore mark very soon'
p5363
aS'we wish to introduce mobile governance'
p5364
aS'how can the poorest of the poor become a part of this system'
p5365
aS'and when we talk of digital india we should aim to take the bpos from centers like hyderabad mumbai bangalore chennai and ahmedabad to the north east where the youth is well versed with the english language and can speak it fluently'
p5366
aS'we are trying our best to proceed in that direction to arrange for a regular means of income for the youth'
p5367
aS'everyone has also expressed their concerns over the issue of black money'
p5368
aS'this is the topic where nobody ever has expressed their thoughts before'
p5369
aS'only we kept talking about it'
p5370
aS'and we had a lot of figures at that time'
p5371
aS'i believe that when supreme court had ordered to form sit back in 2011 our dream of extracting all the money stashed away in foreign banks would have been possible'
p5372
aS'however sit was not formed as the time as there were vested interests'
p5373
aS'if sit was formed at the time and all the procedures had started it wouldnt have been as difficult and time consuming to bring back the money'
p5374
aS'and i believe that even now all money stashed abroad must be brought back to the country'
p5375
aS'we are doing whatever legally required to address this issue'
p5376
aS'also whether it is about the g-20 summit or about the dialogue with switzerland or talking to america about mou we are on signing a mou to exchange information with the world'
p5377
aS'one after other new countries are joining this movement because without proper information we wont be able to fight this battle'
p5378
aS'on the other hand indian citizens will have to declare information about any property or wealth that they have stashed away on foreign shores as per the new laws'
p5379
aS'as a result of this things will come into light and it is in this manner that we plan for bringing back the black money'
p5380
aS'we will complete this procedure and we must do this'
p5381
aS'all the respected members present here have expressed their concerns over land acquisition'
p5382
aS'this is a gathering of seniors and i assure all of you that under this scheme i have ensured from day 1 that if there is anything against the farmers of the country we are ready to correct it'
p5383
aS'but what has been promulgated has its flaws because we were a participant in that'
p5384
aS'we wont deny that we had not done this'
p5385
aS'if we had done something good then dont give credit to us but there has been a wrongdoing then we too are responsible for it'
p5386
aS'but now we should come out of it - for the betterment and development of the country'
p5387
aS'and i dont want to make into an ego issue or play politics here'
p5388
aS'we will need land for irrigation in order to ensure that the farmers have enough water for their crops and thus theprime ministers krishi sinchai yojana will be a success'
p5389
aS'we will need land to make roads in villages and also to make houses for the poor under the rural housing scheme'
p5390
aS'and there is no provision in our current laws'
p5391
aS'hence i request you not to spread rumors that there is a deduction in compensation'
p5392
aS'no one has ever tweaked the rules of compensation before'
p5393
aS'as decided the compensation will remain the same and there wont be any decrease in that'
p5394
aS'but the law was made in 2013'
p5395
aS'what happened'
p5396
aS'it was implemented in january 2014'
p5397
aS'the rule was implemented in haryana in the month of july despite the fact that congress was the ruling party there'
p5398
aS'they refused to give the compensation as decided by the rules made under the law'
p5399
aS'not just that we made these laws in maharashtra where congress was the ruling party'
p5400
aS'this means that states are finding it difficult to function as per these laws'
p5401
ag449
ag449
aS'i am not talking about congress or bjp here'
p5402
ag449
ag449
aS'but they are definitely facing problems and finding it difficult'
p5403
aS'and all the states have expressed their despair and as this is the council of states it is our duty to protect all states'
p5404
aS'and it is our first responsibility of this council to act upon the concern that the states have expressed and ensure that law does not prove to be a burden on the states and rework it according to the hopes and aspirations of the respective states'
p5405
aS'the law will stay we have to remove the flaws'
p5406
aS'if there is any flaw in that then we will have to remove it as well'
p5407
aS'and i invite you all to come and help us in our quest of evolution tour to develop the country'
p5408
aS'and no matter how intelligent we are we should consider the fact that the laws that have helped the country develop and also served the farmers of the country from 1894 to 2014 a total of 120 years would not have lost its efficiency overnight'
p5409
aS'we have to think about the farmers of our country and strive to protect them but we have to do it together and this is my insistence'
p5410
aS'theres another misconception that is being spread perhaps not intentionally but due to wrong information'
p5411
aS'i request you to not do this'
p5412
aS'the government has no intention to deduct anything from the 67 promised coverage for the poor'
p5413
aS'some are spreading rumors about the decrease of coverage from 67 to 40 i believe that this will not happen and i request you to refrain from spreading such rumors and trouble us'
p5414
aS'this devolution that has happened'
p5415
ag449
ag449
aS'the work assigned to them was the restructuring of food corporation of india'
p5416
aS'see there are 50 different types of reports that comes to the government'
p5417
aS'you also must have submitted reports but it is not on the basis of reports the government only conveys its decision'
p5418
aS'i only inform you about the governments decision'
p5419
aS'and i believe you are the connected with governments decisions'
p5420
aS'another thing is that due to this 42 devolution the following changes will be seen'
p5421
ag449
ag449
aS'derek ji west bengal will get rs'
p5422
aS'22000 crore extra andhra pradesh will get rs'
p5423
aS'15000 crore extra orissa will get rs'
p5424
aS'8000 crore extra'
p5425
aS'likewise i can tell all the extra money that every state will be getting but for now i have brought the list of only 3 states'
p5426
aS'the budget features a comprehensive list comprising of telangana as well'
p5427
aS'everyone is getting 42 percent'
p5428
aS'now the biggest thing about the rise of royalty on minerals that has been increased by 1'
p5429
aS'5 per cent which is going to benefit mostly the eastern regions of the country'
p5430
aS'not only that the money raised by the coal auctions will also be given to the states'
p5431
aS'till date 19 coal mines have been auctioned and more than rs 1 lakh crore has been generated from the same'
p5432
aS'this money will also be given to these states'
p5433
aS'according to the calculation of the total amount received the bulk 62 will be with the states and only 38 will be with the center'
p5434
aS'this is a proper procedure that is being implemented and hence some people advice that it needs to be verified'
p5435
aS'not only that foreign policies were also discussed'
p5436
aS'in the current scenario it is safe to assume that as opposed to earlier the world is divided into different parts now'
p5437
aS'the dynamics of the camps of this world has changed over the years'
p5438
aS'to protect the supreme interest of india is the centre point of our foreign policy'
p5439
aS'i had said this before the elections post it and even after becoming the prime minister of the country that the world needs to realise the greatness of india'
p5440
aS'as far as the foreign policy is concerned our stance would be to build relationships with the world'
p5441
aS'we want to build deeper bonds with the neighbouring nations'
p5442
aS'however we will be at par with the rest of the nations and never be subdued in front of them in order to build good relationships'
p5443
aS'however we will also not be dominant'
p5444
aS'we just want to be at par with the other nations and develop healthy and fruitful relationships with all of them'
p5445
aS'we are working in that direction and you will be happy to know about the return of father prems return from the clutches of the terrorists in afghanistan which can not be termed as an ordinary event'
p5446
aS'and in the past 9 months 12000 indians that have been stuck in various parts of the world have been retrieved back to the country'
p5447
aS'the nurses from kerala who were stuck with the terrorists have also been brought back to the country safe and sound'
p5448
aS'the government had provided them with air tickets to their home state'
p5449
aS'another important discussion was the issue of jammu and kashmir'
p5450
aS'i want to assure the house and also 125 crore indians that the government formed in jammu and kashmir is on the basis of common minimum programme and will continue to function with the same idea'
p5451
aS'we cant support it on the basis of someones statement'
p5452
aS'the government will go forward with a zero tolerance policy towards terrorism'
p5453
aS'but if we continue to react to every statement made i believe that we will not proceed in the correct direction'
p5454
aS'we are proceeding with our rules and plans'
p5455
aS'i will tell this clearly that the voters of kashmir have not only honored democracy by coming out in maximum numbers to vote but they have also sent out a loud and clear message to the world about kashmir'
p5456
aS'and hence the fact that india had been advocating since the past 50 years kashmir voters had managed to put a seal of approval on it'
p5457
aS'hearty congratulations to them'
p5458
aS'i congratulate the citizens of kashmir'
p5459
aS'and we place our trust in the citizens of kashmir and for the trust that they have placed in us we promise to protect the unity and integrity of the country'
p5460
aS'and hence once again i would like to say through the medium of this house and the head of the house that we assure that we will follow the proposals for the betterment of kashmir approved by the councils of india'
p5461
aS'there will be no compromise on the subject and i assure this to the people of the country'
p5462
aS'i would once again request the assembly to approve the presidents speech of his proposal of vote of thanks with consensus'
p5463
aS'i would like to thank everyone'
p5464
aS'on international womens day i salute the indomitable courage and stellar achievements of women'
p5465
aS'today we renew our pledge to make women an equal and integral part of our development journey'
p5466

p5473

p5707
aS'we see this in our strong diaspora across oceans'
p5708
aS'the seas forged links of commerce culture and religion with our extended neighbourhood across several millenniums'
p5709
aS'our more recent history has focused our attention on our continental neighborhood'
p5710
aS'but india has been shaped in more ways by the seas around us'
p5711
aS'today 90 of our trade by volume and 90 of our oil imports take place through sea'
p5712
aS'we have coastline of 7500 km 1200 islands and 2'
p5713
aS'4 million square kilometers of exclusive economic zone'
p5714
aS'india is becoming more integrated globally'
p5715
aS'we will be more dependent than before on the ocean and the surrounding regions'
p5716
aS'we must also assume our responsibility to shape its future'
p5717

p5734
aS'we must promote greater collaboration in trade tourism and investment infrastructure development marine science and technology sustainable fisheries protection of marine environment and overall development of ocean or blue economy'
p5735
aS'to me the blue chakra or wheel in indias national flag represents the potential of blue revolution or the ocean economy'

aS'that is how central the ocean economy is to us'
p5737
aS'for those who live by the ocean climate change is not an issue of debate but a serious threat to existence'
p5738
aS'we must assume leadership in our region and call for a more concerted and fair global action to address the challenge of climate change'
p5739
aS'our indian ocean rim association can be an important instrument for pursuing our vision for a sustainable and prosperous future in the region'
p5740

p6076
aS'greetings to all my dear farmer brothers and sisters'
p6077
aS'today i feel so fortunate to avail this opportunity to speak with my farmer brothers and sisters from different corners of the country'
p6078
aS'when i speak to farmers i speak to the village and its residents and also to the farm labourers'
p6079
aS'i am also speaking to the mothers and sisters who work on the farm fields'
p6080
aS'and in this context probably this feeling is a little different from all the interactions i had through mann ki baat'
p6081
aS'when i decided to speak about farmers in mann ki baat i never expected that the farmers from far off villages across the country would be willing to ask numerous questions and would provide such information'
p6082
aS'i was taken aback to receive your numerous letters and questions in such huge numbers'
p6083
aS'i can say that you all are very aware and active and you all probably yearn that somebody listens to you'
p6084
aS'first of all i would like to express my heartfelt greetings to you all'
p6085
aS'i have read your letters and understood the agony and struggle in your lives'
p6086
aS'despite bearing so much misery i can not imagine what all you have gone through in your lives'
p6087
aS'you all have taken me aback but i take this mann ki baat to be an opportunity for education and experience'
p6088
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters i would like to assure you that all your questions and queries from different aspects that you brought to my notice would be addressed by me and i will bring consciousness and sensitivity on those subjects in my government and not let my village my poor people my farmer brothers will not be forced to live in this pathetic condition'
p6089
aS'i am shocked farmers have written letters related to farming but they have also brought some other issues like the problems they face with the village mafias and gangs'
p6090
aS'i can understand the problems related to natural calamities but they are also facing the issues with small time businessmen'
p6091
aS'some farmers have to drink contaminated water in their villages some have raised concerns on the facilities to provide shelter to their cattle and some have also mentioned that there is no facility to dispose off the dead animals which leads to various diseases among the villagers'
p6092
aS'this suggests that today through mann ki baat the governing bodies are getting a unique chance to understand numerous problems of the farmers'
p6093
aS'we can attain our rights to govern the country only when we can understand and provide solution to all these small but important issues'
p6094
aS'i feel so embarrassed when i read your letters and think what we have done so far'
p6095
aS'i have no answer to this question'
p6096
aS'what have we done'
p6097
aS'yes you words have touched my heart'
p6098
aS'i will try my best to bring a change and would awaken the sleeping government to run in the most appropriate manner'
p6099
aS'this will be my primary focus and that is a promise from my side'
p6100
aS'i am aware that you had to face great difficulties last year due to scarcity of rain'
p6101
aS'this year due to the unseasonal rain and hail-storm all the states above maharashtra had to bear a lot of difficulties'
p6102
aS'farmers across all the corners of the country had to face great difficulties'
p6103
aS'a poor farmer who leads his life through slogging in the fields has no other source of living or income'
p6104
aS'i am with you in this difficult time of your life'
p6105
aS'our government is also taking stock of the situation minutely on various issues of the farmer and is in touch with different departments of the state'
p6106
aS'the ministers are also out in the field visiting various states and collecting reviews and analysing its situation'
p6107
aS'i have also asked the state governments to work closely along with the central government and strive to help as much as possible to our farmer brothers and sisters in this situation'
p6108
aS'i can assure you that the government will take proper steps and solve your problems promptly and help you in this difficult time'
p6109
aS'we will do whatever is possible to help you and do our best to fulfil those'
p6110
aS'villagers and farmers have raised various issues'
p6111
aS'irrigation problem is one of the most important issues'
p6112
aS'farmers are also angry due to the unavailability of roads in villages'
p6113
aS'they are also unhappy about the increasing price of fertilizers'
p6114
aS'there is no electricity'
p6115
aS'they are also unhappy about the fact that they are unable to educate their children which in their wish is also a complaint'
p6116
aS'mothers and sisters are angry with the drug abuse prevailing in the villages'
p6117
aS'some women have also addressed the issues of tobacco intake by their husbands'
p6118
aS'i can understand your pain'
p6119
aS'some farmers believe that they can only hear the strategies adopted by the government but it never reaches the villagers'
p6120
aS'farmers have mentioned that they slog day and night to provide food to the entire nation but they never receive the full amount of money in return'
p6121
aS'when they go out to sell the crops and other farm products there is no one to buy from us'
p6122
aS'so they are left with no other option than to sell the products at lower prices'
p6123
aS'they are doomed in both the case if they produce more or less'
p6124
aS'this means farmers have brought to my notice their inner thoughts through their letters'
p6125
aS'i can assure all my farmer brothers and sisters that the state and central government will take proper steps actively from now on'
p6126
aS'i will inspire the government to speed up the actions and provide solutions to all your problems'
p6127
aS'i can understand that you are losing patience'
p6128
aS'this is quite natural as you have waited for sixty long years'
p6129
aS'i will try to find a full-proof solution to this'
p6130
aS'my farmer brothers i have found one primary problem among your various questions that is the acquisition of land bill prevailing in almost all the states'
p6131
aS'i am shocked to hear these rumours spread across the country'
p6132
aS'it is good that you have raised such small issues and questions'
p6133
aS'i will try to bring the truth before you'
p6134
aS'you must be aware that the acquisition of land bill was passed 120 years ago'
p6135
aS'post-independence this law was practised till 60-65 years'
p6136
aS'today the activists who call themselves as the supporters of farmers also practised this law in the country governed the country and the farmers got their share'
p6137
aS'everybody believed that there should be a change in this law and i too believed in the change'
p6138
aS'we were in the opposition and we too believed in the change of law'
p6139
aS'in the year 2013 a new law was passed in haste'
p6140
aS'we too supported this law giving our full support to the government'
p6141
aS'if a law benefits the farmers who would not like to support it so we too supported the law'
p6142
aS'but after the initiation of the law some of the concerns got raised in our minds'
p6143
aS'we felt that this way we would be betraying the hopes of farmers'
p6144
aS'we do not have any rights to betray the farmers'
p6145
aS'on one side when our government was formed we saw that all the states raised their voice to amend the law to improve the law the law must be modified to plug the loop holes'
p6146
aS'on the other side we found that no state is ready to implement the law only maharashtra and haryana governments under congress rule had implemented the law who proclaim to be well-wishers of farmers they brought an ordinance and decided to provide just half of the decided amount as compensation'
p6147
aS'what kind of justice is this to the farmers'
p6148
aS'after reviewing all these points we felt that there should be some re-thinking'
p6149
aS'when things are done in haste then some drawbacks remain'
p6150
aS'the motive might be good but if there are drawbacks then they should be rectified'
p6151
aS'now i will speak of most primary drawback which you all will find quite astonishing'
p6152
aS'all the people who are self-proclaimed well-wishers of farmers are not ready to give any answers to these questions'
p6153
aS'are you all aware that there are 13 different laws in our country through which most of our countrys land like railway national highway and minefields is acquired'
p6154
aS'are you aware that in the law of previous government these 13 areas have been excluded from the law'
p6155
aS'with this exclusion i mean that the farmers would receive the same compensation as they used to get under the previous law'
p6156
aS'you tell me is this not a drawback'
p6157
aS'this was a mistake or not'
p6158
aS'this was a mistake or not'
p6159
aS'we have modified this law and the farmers would receive four times the compensation even if these 13 areas be used for railways or highways'
p6160
aS'we have tried to improve the law'
p6161
aS'who would say that this amendment is against the farmers'
p6162
aS'this is why we had brought an ordinance'
p6163
aS'if we wouldnt have brought the enactment the lands of farmers would have been used according to the previous law and they would not have received their compensation'
p6164
aS'when this law was passed many in the government too raised their voice against this law'
p6165
aS'even those who were involved in the making of the law got upset and said that this law is neither beneficial to the farmers nor the village or to the country'
p6166
aS'this law can be useful it was said only to fill the treasury of the officers and for their enjoyment to promote red-tapism'
p6167
aS'if this was the truth apt modifications should have been done or not'
p6168
aS'thus we have tried to eliminate the drawbacks of the law and work on the direction of betterment of the farmers'
p6169
aS'firstly we have included the 13 laws which were excluded under the acquisition of land bill so that the farmers are provided with the remuneration and all rights and they do not have to incur loss due to the exclusion'
p6170
aS'i have heard the rumours being spread that modi government is passing a law which will provide less remuneration to the farmers and they will not receive the full compensation'
p6171
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters i can not even think of committing this sin'
p6172
aS'in the year 2013 under the dispensation of previous government the compensation which was decided has not been modified a bit'
p6173
aS'we have decided to provide four times the compensation than the one provided earlier'
p6174
aS'not only this we have also included the 13 areas which were excluded in the earlier law'
p6175
aS'we have also continued with the clause that in case of acquisition of land for development of the city the land owners will receive 20 of the developed land so that they are benefited financially at all times'
p6176
aS'the youth of the family gets a job'
p6177
aS'we have also decided to provide employment to the children of the farmers'
p6178
aS'we have also added a new programme'
p6179
aS'the new addition is that the district authorities will have to announce that who will be employed from the family in what field they will be employed and what will be their work location'
p6180
aS'government will have to provide written announcement for the same'
p6181
aS'we have fixed the government responsibility by adding this feature'
p6182
aS'my dear farmer brother and sisters we all agree that the government land must be used first'
p6183
aS'post this the barren land must be used'
p6184
aS'lastly when there is no option left the farm lands can be touched'
p6185
aS'so we have started a survey for finding all the barren lands for making it a priority for usage'
p6186
aS'we have received complaints from our farmers that more than the required land is for use is gobbled up'
p6187
aS'with the enactment of this new law i can assure you that before using the land a survey will be conducted and then it will be decided so that more than the required land is not acquired'
p6188
aS'sometimes in the foresight that something is going to happen there is lot of damage'
p6189
aS'in the name of social impact assessment sia if these judicial proceedings are carried on for several years how can a farmer take a right decision in this situation'
p6190
aS'he can not decide whether to grow the crops in the field as he is in a fix as he will keep thinking that the judgement can come any day'
p6191
aS'this will lead to two to four years of loss and things will be stuck due to red-tapism'
p6192
aS'due to the long and difficult proceedings a poor farmer is forced to beg before the officers to get their work done sir please write this please do not write this'
p6193
ag449
ag449
ag449
aS'this is going to happen that is going to happen'
p6194
aS'i do not want my farmers to fall prey to these officers'
p6195
aS'i do not think this is a right thing to do'
p6196
aS'procedures were long and difficult'
p6197
aS'i have tried to make this procedure simple and easy'
p6198
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters the law was passed in the year 2014 but the states have not adopted the law yet'
p6199
aS'farmers are still at the same place'
p6200
aS'states have opposed this law'
p6201
aS'please tell me if i should listen to the states or not'
p6202
aS'i should trust the states or not'
p6203
aS'how can a country run without trusting its own states'
p6204
aS'so i believe we should trust our states and we should specially trust our central government'
p6205
aS'one i am willing to trust my states and secondly the improvement we are trying to bring in the law by trying to eliminate the drawbacks and trying to better the conditions of the farmers even after this if the states are not ready to support this movement they are free to do so'
p6206
aS'that is why i would like to request you all not to fall prey to these rumours'
p6207
aS'these rumours are absolutely against farmer rumours'
p6208
aS'it is part of the conspiracy of keeping the farmers poor as always'
p6209
aS'this is a part of the conspiracy of not taking the country forward'
p6210
aS'we have to save ourselves from this conspiracy and save our country and save our farmers as well'
p6211
aS'now if one were to ask the farmer residing in the village that what are your plans for your three sons'
p6212
aS'he will respond that one of them will carry on with the farming but the other two will have to seek jobs elsewhere'
p6213
aS'so now even the sons of farmers are seeking out jobs'
p6214
aS'they too have to move out and seek employment somewhere'
p6215
aS'so arrangements need to be made for that too'
p6216
aS'so we have decided that whatever is important for the welfare of the village welfare of the farmer and whatever is important for the employment of members of the farming community all such things should be connected'
p6217
aS'we are the ones who believe in jai jawan jai kisan'
p6218
aS'jai jawan is related to the security of the country'
p6219
aS'as far as the security of the nation is concerned the farmers of the nation do not ever step back from their responsibilities'
p6220
aS'if some land is required for national security we will have to ask the farmers for it'
p6221
aS'and i have complete faith that the farmers will give us the land'
p6222
aS'so we have added the clause for taking land for such purposes'
p6223
aS'i want to ask each and every member of the village is road required or not'
p6224
aS'if water is required in the fields dont we need to create canals'
p6225
aS'there are still many poor families in the village who do not have a house to live in'
p6226
aS'is not land required for construction of houses'
p6227
aS'tell me is this for the industrialists'
p6228
aS'is this land being demanded for the ultra rich'
p6229
aS'try and understand the truth'
p6230
aS'yes there is something i want to announce without a doubt'
p6231
aS'in the new ordinance too any private industrialist owner of a manufacturing unit will have to follow the same set of rules that were laid out in the land acquisition act of 2013'
p6232
aS'the rules for the corporates are the same as in 2013'
p6233
aS'then why this lies are being spread'
p6234
aS'my farmer brother and sisters misunderstanding is being created that you will not get your legal rights that you can not approach the courts'
p6235
aS'this is entirely false'
p6236
aS'no government at the centre can take away your legal rights'
p6237
aS'the constitution given to us by baba saheb ambedkar ensures that you can approach any court in any part of the country'
p6238
aS'all we have done is to bring some sort of system to your doorsteps'
p6239
aS'we have created an authority'
p6240
aS'now this authority will work at district level and the issues of the farmers will be resolved at the district level itself by the authority'
p6241
aS'and if you are not satisfied with the solutions offered there you can approach the courts as well'
p6242
aS'this is the arrangement we have made'
p6243
aS'there is a misconception that the law related to returning the acquired land in five years has been scrapped'
p6244
aS'this is not true dear farmer brothers and sisters what we have said whenever a project is undertake a timeline has to be specified in terms of the number of years in which it will be completed'
p6245
aS'if the project is not completed in the specified time period then whatever farmers wish has to be adhered to'
p6246
aS'so we have set a timeframe for government projects'
p6247
aS'what is the todays case scenario those lands which were acquired about 40 years ago the government has not done anything on them'
p6248
aS'this can not continue any longer'
p6249
aS'we have decided to set a time limit to governmental projects'
p6250
aS'yes there are projects which take time maybe around 20 years'
p6251
aS'for example if 500 km long railway track is to be laid then it will take time'
p6252
aS'so we want it all written down the time frame in which a project will be completed'
p6253
aS'so what we are doing is fixing the liability of the government'
p6254
aS'we have fixed the governments responsibility'
p6255
aS'let me also tell you something dear farmer brothers'
p6256
aS'those sitting in the air conditioned rooms who formulate these rules have no idea of the condition of the villagers'
p6257
aS'whenever a dam is made or a reservoir is constructed the rule is to acquire land till the point where there is a possibility of water getting to the maximum level in a span of 100 years'
p6258
aS'so the water gets filled once in 100 years'
p6259
aS'for 99 years no water gets filled'
p6260
aS'yet the land lies with the government'
p6261
aS'what is currently happening in the states is that land has been acquired compensation paid and yet farmers are working on those lands'
p6262
aS'if the land gets flooded once in 100 years that year the land can be taken'
p6263
aS'the law of 2013 denied the farmers the right to cultivate the land'
p6264
aS'all we want is that if the land does not get flooded then it should be available for farmers for cultivation'
p6265
aS'and hence that land should not be acquired from the farmer'
p6266
aS'this kind of flexibility is necessary'
p6267
aS'so the farmer benefits even after giving up the land and also get compensation in lieu of their land'
p6268
aS'this will doubly benefit the farmers'
p6269
aS'this kind of organization is both necessary and practical'
p6270
aS'and we are the ones who have thought about it'
p6271
aS'another misconception being spread is that consent is not necessary'
p6272
aS'i urge you my brothers and sisters to protect yourself from such politically motivated propaganda'
p6273
aS'the law which was promulgated in 2013 has no provision for consent in schemes for which the government is acquiring land'
p6274
aS'so people are being misled on this consent issue'
p6275
aS'the issue of consent did not exist previously it does not exist now'
p6276
aS'and so my brothers and sisters to say that it was beneficial for you before but it is not so now this is an unfortunate attempt to mislead you'
p6277
aS'i assure and insist that this consent clause is very much functional in case of private industries corporate and individual enterprise'
p6278
aS'another thing i would like to share that some people talk about the ppp model'
p6279
aS'dear brother and sisters if a road worth rs'
p6280
aS'100 crores is made will the corporate run away with it'
p6281
aS'the ownership of the road will be with the government'
p6282
aS'the ownership of the land is with the government'
p6283
aS'the construction agency is different'
p6284
aS'the construction agency is different because the government does not have the requisite amount of money'
p6285
aS'the government wants that a road be made in the village as well as hospital and the poor children get education so monetary investment is required'
p6286
aS'the private investors construct roads but not for themselves'
p6287
aS'he does not take it with himself he makes it for the government'
p6288
aS'in a way he invests his money'
p6289
aS'this means in a government project someone else puts in the money which is called the ppp model'
p6290
aS'but the ownership rests with the government and government means of all of you of the 125 crore indians and hence we have said there that there is no need for a consent'
p6291
aS'hence it was necessary for me to dispel these myths around the ppp model'
p6292
aS'sometimes this issue of consent will increase red-tapism and nepotism'
p6293
aS'tell me there is a village a road has been constructed till that village now a road has to be constructed till the next village which is 5 kms ahead'
p6294
aS'the road for the first village has been made but the land for the road to other village lies with the previous village'
p6295
aS'so tell me will the villagers wilfully give land for road till the other village'
p6296
aS'tell me will they give their consent'
p6297
aS'so what sin have the people of other village committed'
p6298
aS'should they not get the roads'
p6299
aS'similarly if i am making a canal this village has got the water and we have to provide water supply to another village and the said land falls with the people of the previous village who already have water and they deny giving their consent for acquiring their land and say that we already have the water we are not going to give consent for land acquisition for supply of water to another village'
p6300
aS'so now you tell me the people of the other village should get water or not'
p6301
aS'my brothers and sisters this is a practical issue'
p6302
aS'so we are evolving a process which does not take long'
p6303
aS'this is for the farmers right not for industries and industrialists'
p6304
aS'it is for the betterment of the villages the villagers and the benefit of their children'
p6305
aS'another issue is coming up'
p6306
aS'i have said this before'
p6307
aS'in every farmer family the farmer wants one son to do farming and the others to take up other sources of employment'
p6308
aS'such are the times today that different efforts need to be mad to run the household'
p6309
aS'if we make a road and government establishes an industrial corridor next to it which is not private'
p6310
aS'i again reiterate that a corridor by the government not for the rich or the industrialists so if the government makes a corridor on the left or right of a 50 or 100 km road then all the residents of the near those villages maybe 50 100 200 villages falling along it will have an opportunity for employment their kin will get employment'
p6311
aS'tell me dear brother and sisters do we want the children of our villages to suffocate in the slums of delhi and mumbai'
p6312
aS'should they not get an employment opportunity closer to their home if a small industry comes up some 20-25 kms away from their village'
p6313
aS'so this corridor will be made by the government and will not be private'
p6314
aS'the government will make these corridors and create these employment opportunities for the villagers'
p6315
aS'this proposal is about government ownership it is for the betterment of the villages betterment of the farmers of villages it is for the betterment of the future generations of the villagers it is for the betterment of the poor of the villages it is to make electricity available to the villages'
p6316
aS'for these there were some drawbacks in the last land acquisition bill which we have tried to resolve all the shortcomings of this bill authentically'
p6317
aS'still i have maintained in the parliament that if anyone feels that there are some short comings we are ready to make amendments'
p6318
aS'when we put the bill in the parliament certain leaders of the farming community gave us some suggestions and we added them'
p6319
aS'we still say that the land acquisition should be pro farmers'
p6320
aS'we are committed for this'
p6321
aS'there are lot of lies being spread'
p6322
aS'i request you dear brothers to not get swayed and dont make your decision based on these lies'
p6323
aS'important issue is how to make farmers strong how to make our villages strong'
p6324
aS'the farmer should get the right price for his efforts farmers should get a proper market a proper storage for his production'
p6325
aS'it is our effort to make right decisions for the betterment of the village and the farmers'
p6326
aS'dear brothers and sisters it is our effort to see that the nation progresses and so do our farmers by increasing their yield'
p6327
aS'and so we have introduced soil health card'
p6328
aS'if a person falls sick a laboratory test is undertaken for them similarly a lab test can be undertaken for our motherland'
p6329
aS'so we are working not only to protect your land but also to make it healthy'
p6330
aS'and so not land acquisition but making the land healthy is our task'
p6331
aS'and so we have introduced the concept of soil health card'
p6332
aS'every farmer is going to benefit from it'
p6333
aS'your undue expenses on fertilizers will be saved'
p6334
aS'your yield will increase'
p6335
aS'that you get proper price for your production there should be proper granaries proper rules and regulations and that you are saved from exploitation - we are working on all these issues'
p6336
aS'i remember when i was the chief minister of gujarat i worked a lot in this direction'
p6337
aS'the condition of farmers in our gujarat was very bad we worked on the water issues and we saw a big change'
p6338
aS'the farmers made a huge contribution to the development of gujarat which was beyond all expectations'
p6339
aS'the entire villages would be deserted but the change happened'
p6340
aS'we want this type of change in the entire country which makes our farmers very happy'
p6341
aS'and so my farmer brother and sisters today i got an opportunity to talk to you'
p6342
aS'but the issue of the ordinance is making headlines every day and i chose to speak about it more'
p6343
aS'but my dear brothers and sisters i will speak to you again and on other issues'
p6344
aS'but i want to assure you that whatever you have written to me i will shake the entire government and will make them see the reality about what is actually happening on the ground'
p6345
aS'i am happy that you have told me so many things and i believe that you have told me because you trust me'
p6346
aS'i want to assure you that i will not shatter your faith'
p6347
aS'i desire your love and blessings at all times'
p6348
aS'you are the elders of the nation you can never think wrong for others rather you will suffer loses for others benefit'
p6349
aS'this has been your tradition'
p6350
aS'and these farmers do not suffer should have to be the prime focus of my government'
p6351
aS'today after hearing this mann ki baat many thoughts may have arisen in your mind'
p6352
aS'please do write into me at the akashvani address'
p6353
aS'i will talk again'
p6354
aS'based on your letters i will try to rectify all the mistakes of my government'
p6355
aS'i will try to speed up the efforts and if somewhere injustice is being done i will try and provide justice'
p6356
aS'we are in middle of the auspicious festival of navratri'
p6357
aS'my heartfelt greetings to you all'
p6358
aS'director general madam bukovaexcellencies ladies and gentlemen i am truly honoured to address unesco'
p6359
aS'i feel specially privileged to visit this great institution in its 70th anniversary year'
p6360
aS'this milestone reminds us of a fundamental achievement of our age for the first time in human history we have an organization for the entire world the united nations'
p6361
aS'and through the sweeping change of these decades through many challenges of our times and the great progress of this era the organization has endured and grown'
p6362
aS'there have been doubts and skepticism'
p6363
aS'there is need for urgent reforms'
p6364
aS'but for the nations that came together at its birth and for three times as many that joined it later there is one unshakeable belief our world is and will remain a better place because of the united nations'
p6365
aS'it is this faith that has given birth to so many of its institutions that deal with every aspect of human challenges'
p6366
aS'our collective goal is to seek a peaceful and prosperous future for our world in which every nation has a voice all peoples have an identity all cultures are flowers in a garden every human being has a life of dignity every child a future of opportunity and our planet the chance to preserve its glory'
p6367
aS'no organization serves our cause more than this one'
p6368
aS'the seeds of our collective destiny are sown in human minds'
p6369
aS'it is nurtured by the light of education and the spirit of enquiry'
p6370
aS'it makes progress through the marvels of science'
p6371
aS'and it draws strength from the basic character of nature the harmony and unity in diversity'
p6372
aS'that is why unesco was among the first missions of the united nations'
p6373
aS'that is why india values the work of unesco so deeply and cherishes our partnership so immensely'
p6374
aS'i am conscious of the extraordinary legacy of our relationship from the time of unescos birth'
p6375
aS'i recall mahatma gandhis message to unesco calling for urgent action to address the needs of education to secure lasting peace and the leadership of dr'
p6376
aS'radhakrishnan later our first president in the early years of this institution'
p6377
aS'we are grateful for unescos support for education and science in india and for preservation of our cultural heritage'
p6378
aS'equally we are privileged to have worked with unesco in support of its mission around the world'
p6379
aS'for in the challenges india faces and the dreams that indians seek our approach mirrors the ideals of unesco'
p6380
aS'we have built a modern state in an ancient land with a timeless tradition of openness and co-existence and a society of extraordinary diversity'
p6381
aS'the foundation of our constitution rests on a fundamental principle the peace and prosperity of all is indivisible from the welfare of the individual the strength of the nation is determined by the joined hands of every citizen and real progress is measured through empowerment of the weakest'
p6382
aS'this has been our creed since we assumed office nearly a year ago'
p6383
aS'and we shall judge our progress not just by the cold statistics of growth but by the warm glow of belief and hope on human faces'
p6384
aS'for me it means many things'
p6385
aS'we will defend and protect the rights and liberty of every citizen'
p6386
aS'we will ensure that every citizen of every faith culture and creed has an equal place in our society belief in her future and the confidence to pursue it'
p6387
aS'education always had a special place in our tradition'
p6388
aS'as our ancient saying goes it is the wealth that increases by giving that wealth is knowledge and is supreme of all possessionswe have launched the most ambitious programme to provide skills to our youth and education for every child in the remotest villages'
p6389
aS'our progress will remain a mirage unless women no longer suffer from daily fear or barriers to opportunity and when they are no longer victims of exclusion and prejudice'
p6390
aS'and this change must begin with the girl child'
p6391
aS'so the programme to educate and support the girl child in india is one that is closest to my heart'
p6392
aS'we will ensure that they can go to school and also that they can attend it in safety and dignity'
p6393
aS'today the digital age has created opportunities beyond imagination but digital divide can expand disparities'
p6394
aS'on the other hand digital connectivity and smart phones have create a revolution of possibilities to educate deliver services and extend development'
p6395
aS'this is the most exciting change in our era'
p6396
aS'our digital india will create a participative transparent and a responsive government connected to the citizens'
p6397
aS'and we have launched a digital literacy mission to connect each of our 600000 villages'
p6398
aS'the link between habitat and fulfillment of human potential is deep and strong'
p6399
aS'so the highest priority for my government is to provide a roof over every head power in every house sanitation and clean water within everyones reach a hope for every child to survive and a chance for every new mother to love her child'
p6400
aS'it also means clean rivers air that we can breathe and forests filled with the sound of birds'
p6401
aS'to achieve these goals we need not just policies and resources but even more the power of science'
p6402
aS'for us science is driven by the larger purpose of human development and for a safe sustainable prosperous future for india'
p6403
aS'science also unites people across borders in a shared purpose'
p6404
aS'and when we share its fruits with those who dont have it we connect lives and make our world a better place'
p6405
aS'india never forgets the help we have received in our early years today we are fulfilling our responsibility to others'
p6406
aS'therefore science is a key priority of indias international engagement'
p6407
aS'culture is a sublime expression of a people and the foundations of a society'
p6408
aS'unescos initiatives to preserve the worlds cultural heritage including in india are inspiring'
p6409
aS'we see indias rich and diverse cultural heritage as humanitys wealth'
p6410
aS'and we will do everything to preserve it for future generations'
p6411
aS'we have launched heritage development and augmentation yojana hriday or heart in hindi to preserve the cultural heritage of our cities'
p6412
aS'we have started a special scheme called prasad or offerings pilgrimage rejuvenation and spirituality augmentation drive for rejuvenation of our pilgrim centres'
p6413
aS'madam chairman i speak of our vision and initiatives because in our own aspirations and efforts we see the value of unesco to our world with great clarity'
p6414
aS'in the challenges of our times we see its purpose with a sense of urgency'
p6415
aS'the fault lines in our world are shifting from the boundaries of nations into the web of our societies and the streets of our cities'
p6416
aS'the threats are changing from domination by states to destruction by groups'
p6417
aS'we fight today not only over what we claim but also for who we are'
p6418
aS'and in many parts of the world culture remains a source of conflict'
p6419
aS'we have access to communication at the click of a mouse'
p6420
aS'we live in a world of information'
p6421
aS'yet we know that familiarity does not always lead to fraternity or reduce prejudice'
p6422
aS'when ebola threatens an entire region the fury of unseasonal storms destroys crops and lives and diseases still defeat our most courageous fight we understand how fragile we are'
p6423
aS'when we see people living at the edge of existence children shut out of classrooms and nations without the human resources to shoulder the responsibility of progress we know that we still have a long way to go'
p6424
aS'to be sure our world has made incredible progress over seven decades'
p6425
aS'so our progress should inspire us to meet our challenges'
p6426
aS'unesco can play a vital role in addressing them'
p6427
aS'culture must connect not divide our world'
p6428

p6593
aS'- we have targeted 175 giga watt of renewable energy in next few years'
p6594
aS'in addition to generation the issues of transmission and distribution of electricity are equally important for us - we are modernizing our railway systems including signals and railway stations'

p6610
aS'though we have a vibrant relationship our economic partnership is not as much as both countries would like to have'
p6611
aS'the flow of investments from germany is well below the potential and less than indian investments in germany'
p6612
aS'many more german companies have the possibility of investing in india to take advantage of indias potentials'
p6613
aS'the potential lies in manufacturing as well as infrastructure and in skill development for that purpose'
p6614
aS'i know that the reason for this situation may not be from german side'
p6615
aS'it is from the indian side also'

aS'invest india is the nodal agency for this purpose'
p6623
aS'we do believe that fdi is important and it will not come in the country without a globally competitive business environment'
p6624
aS'therefore in this years budget we have rationalized a number of issues which were bothering you'
p6625
aS'in particular - we have removed lot of regressive taxation regimes'
p6626
aS'in our very first budget we said we will not resort to retrospective taxation'
p6627
aS'and if such issues do arise they will have to be reviewed at the highest level'
p6628
aS'we have taken bold steps of not dragging the litigation in a few cases where we felt that the steps of the previous government were not on right lines'
p6629

p6675
aS'whenever anyone in india talks about technology manufacturing or high quality germany is the first country that comes to the mind'

p6677
aS'whatever objectives we think of in terms of economic transformation and improvement in quality of life of ordinary citizens technology skills innovation and investment will play an important role in it'

aS'and it is natural that german companies would benefit a lot from it'
p6695
aS'in this context i would also like to state that negotiations between india and european union on a broad-based trade and investment agreement have remained stalled for two years'
p6696
aS'i have requested chancellor merkel that india and european union should resume the negotiations quickly and conclude a balanced and mutually beneficial agreement at the earliest'

p6771
aS'there has been loss of property because of the earthquake'
p6772
aS'however the loss to nepal is frightening'
p6773
aS'i have seen kutch earthquake very closely on jan 26 2001'
p6774
aS'i can clearly imagine how devastating these disasters are'
p6775
aS'i can imagine what nepal and the victimized families there must be going through'
p6776
aS'but my dear brothers and sisters of nepal india is with you in your hour of grief'
p6777
aS'work has begun to provide assistance to people facing crisis across several locations in india and nepal'
p6778
aS'first and foremost work is rescue operation to save people'
p6779
aS'some people must still be alive under the debris and should get evacuated safely from there'
p6780
aS'a team of experts which has been sent is specifically trained for this task'
p6781
aS'sniffer dogs have been sent as they possess the ability to trace any individual staying alive under the debris'
p6782
aS'our whole endeavour would be to save maximum number of people alive'
p6783
aS'post rescue operation there is a need to undertake relief work as well'
p6784
aS'rehabilitation work will also continue for long'
p6785
aS'however humanity has a power of its own'
p6786
aS'nepal is a dear to 125 crore people of india'
p6787
aS'their grief is our grief'
p6788
aS'india will make sure to wipe the tears of every nepali hold their hands and provide support to them'
p6789
aS'thousands of our indian brothers and sisters were left stranded in yemen a few days ago'
p6790
aS'it was a very tough task to evacuate the indians alive amidst horrific situation amidst the tension of bombs and guns amidst firing but we managed to do so'
p6791
aS'not only this when we safely rescued a new born girl who was just a week old we felt how much power humanity has'
p6792
aS'it brings a sense of satisfaction to the mind by rescuing a week old girl alive amidst raining bombs guns and shadow of death'
p6793
aS'wherever i went overseas in the last few days i received compliments for one thing and that was for saving citizens of 48 countries of the world in yemen'
p6794
aS'be it the citizen of the us the uk france russia germany japan we helped the citizen of every country'
p6795
aS'and due to this the world has experienced the old saying of india meaning the greatest service to humanity is to serve others'
p6796
aS'our ministry of external affairs our air force and our navy have done this work with such courage and responsibility that it will have indelible imprint over the world in the coming days'
p6797
aS'this is what i believe in'
p6798
aS'and i am happy that all the people were evacuated safely without any damage and it should be noted that indias special quality is that our culture is quite old'
p6799
aS'recently when i visited france i went to a memorial of the first world war there'
p6800
aS'the reason for visiting the place was that it is the centenary year of the first world war but at the same time it is the centenary year of indias valour'
p6801
aS'this is the centenary year of the sacrifices made by the indian heroes and meaning the greatest service to humanity is to serve others and how this phrase has been lived by our country this year is a centenary year for this reason also'
p6802
aS'i am saying this because very few people would know that about 15 lakh indian soldiers had put their life at stake during the first world war from 1914 to 1918'
p6803
aS'and the indian soldiers did not die for indias cause'
p6804
aS'india neither wanted to capture any country nor did it want to take away anyones land'
p6805
aS'but the indians had shown amazing strength'
p6806
aS'very few people would know that about 74000 of our soldiers sacrificed their life in the first world war'
p6807
aS'and this is also a matter of pride that about 9200 soldiers who lost their life were bestowed with gallantry award'
p6808
aS'not only this there were eleven such individuals who received the highest honour of victoria cross'
p6809
aS'about 4700 indians had sacrificed their life especially during the world war in march 2015 in france which has made a memorial as a mark of respect for them'
p6810
aS'i went there to commemorate and express my gratitude to the strength displayed by our ancestors'
p6811
aS'if we see all these incidents then we can say to the world that our country thinks in the direction of peace happiness and welfare of the world'
p6812
aS'the country keeps doing something in this direction and if needed put its life at stake'
p6813
aS'india finds itself in the first row among the highest contributors in the peacekeeping force of the united nation'
p6814
aS'that is the matter of pride for us'
p6815
aS'in the last few days i got the opportunity to accomplish two important tasks'
p6816
aS'we are to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of respected babasaheb ambedkar'
p6817
aS'there has been a controversy regarding the land where his memorial was to be built for many years'
p6818
aS'i am satisfied that the government of india decided to allot the land for building the memorial of babasaheb ambedkar'
p6819
aS'similarly there must be an international centre in the name of babasaheb ambedkar in delhi so that the entire world knows this sage his thoughts and his work'
p6820
aS'this was also a matter which was pending for years'
p6821
aS'i completed and laid the foundation stone of the memorial'
p6822
aS'i pledged to complete the work in 20 months which did not happen for 20 years'
p6823
aS'and at the same time a thought has also come into my mind and we are working on it'
p6824
aS'even today there are many families in our country that are forced to carry dirt on their head'
p6825
aS'is it a matter of grace for us that even today some families in our country have to carry the burden of dirt on their head'
p6826
aS'with all earnest i said in the government forum to get us free from this blur in the year when we commemorating babasaheb ambedkar on his 125th birth anniversary'
p6827
aS'now we will not tolerate a situation where any poor will have to take load of dirt on his head in our country'
p6828
aS'for this we need the support of the society government must also shoulder its responsibility'
p6829
aS'i need cooperation of people as we have to do this work'
p6830
aS'babasaheb ambedkar used to say stay educated throughout life'
p6831
aS'even today education has not reached many dalits exploited and deprived ones in the society especially girls'
p6832
aS'we must also pledge on the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedkar'
p6833
aS'there must not be any son or daughter of the poor remaining illiterate in our villages cities and locality'
p6834
aS'government must do its duty'
p6835
aS'and if it gets the support of the society then we will definitely feel a sense of satisfaction'
p6836
aS'i want to share a matter of happiness and share another matter of discomfort as well'
p6837
aS'i take pride of the fact that two daughters of india have made the country proud'
p6838
aS'one daughter -saina nehwal became the worlds no'
p6839
aS'1 in badminton and the second daughter sania mirza became the worlds top player in tennis doubles tournament'
p6840
aS'congratulations to both and all the daughters of our country'
p6841
aS'i feel proud seeing the effort and strength of our own'
p6842
aS'but sometimes we lose cool'
p6843
aS'when the cricket world cup was on and we lost to australia in the semi-finals the kind of words used and the treatment meted out to the players was not good my countrymen'
p6844
aS'how can be a game with no defeat'
p6845
aS'victory and defeat are part and parcel of life'
p6846
aS'if the players of our country have been beaten in a match then we must encourage them in the times of crisis'
p6847
aS'there must be an effort to create an environment to generate new confidence'
p6848
aS'i am sure that we will learn from the defeats going forward and we will not lose control in few moments by indulging in action-reaction'
p6849
aS'and i am getting worried'
p6850
aS'whenever i see that anything happens all of a sudden a mob surrounds and burns the truck burns the vehicle'
p6851
aS'and we see these things on tv as well'
p6852
aS'accident must not happen'
p6853
aS'even the government must make full effort'
p6854
aS'but my dear countrymen tell me if we should burn the vehicles'
p6855
aS'dead ones do not come back'
p6856
aS'cant we ensure law to take its due course keeping our emotion in check'
p6857
aS'well today my mind has been very grief-stricken due to these incidents especially due to natural disasters'
p6858
aS'but amidst this also we will move forward with courage and confidence'
p6859
aS'be it individual of this country - dalit oppressed exploited tribe villager poor farmer small businessman we will move forward on the path of welfare for everyone'
p6860
aS'examinations of students are over'
p6861
aS'especially the students of 10th and 12th standard must have made a program of celebrating the holidays'
p6862
aS'i wish all of you a very good vacation get the opportunity to learn something new'
p6863
aS'and since you have worked hard the whole year then i wish that you spend some time with your family with joy and happiness'
p6864
aS'namaskar to everyone'
p6865
aS'thank you'
p6866
aS'premier li keqiang president of cpaffc madame li xiaolin honble chief ministers governors and mayors this is a historic moment in the relationship between india and china'
p6867
aS'today we are launching a new vehicle for advancing cooperation between our two countries'
p6868
aS'in times to come this will become one of the most important instruments for deepening our economic partnership and contact between our people'
p6869
aS'as someone who has been chief minister for thirteen years and prime minister for one this forum has a special place in my heart'
p6870
aS'but it is not just my sentiments that lead me to give such importance to this new institution'
p6871
aS'it comes from a serious conviction born from my experience that states have a vital role to play in the national development'
p6872
aS'this is especially true for large and populous countries with a high degree of geographical social and economic diversity'
p6873
aS'it becomes even more relevant when the constitutional and political systems are federal in structure'
p6874
aS'these attributes exist in both india and china the worlds two most populous nations'
p6875
aS'in indias constitution state governments have predominant role in economic and social development'
p6876
aS'the central government creates the macro-economic environment'
p6877
aS'it can set the broad social and economic agenda and directions for the nation'
p6878
aS'it can launch development policies and schemes'
p6879
aS'it can manage resources'
p6880
aS'but in the end the state governments have an important role in their implementation'
p6881
aS'but as i saw in my own experience state governments can take innumerable initiatives for the development of the states'
p6882
aS'that is the level of autonomy and responsibility that they enjoy under our constitution'
p6883
aS'in the same national environment states are performing at different levels'
p6884
aS'for business investors too whether they are indian or foreign their journey may begin in delhi but their success ultimately depends on state capitals'
p6885
aS'many of the critical requirements for success infrastructure land utilities skilled human resources and many approvals ultimately depend on the state governments'
p6886
aS'but for me the involvement of states in our national effort is not just because of their constitutional and legal responsibilities'
p6887
aS'it is also stems from a basic management principle'
p6888
aS'the chances of success are higher when we create a sense of participation for everyone when we give everyone a stake in success'
p6889
aS'that is why i speak of team india'
p6890
aS'that is why i believe that the foundation for indias development will not be the single pillar of the central government but 30 pillars comprising the central government and all our states'
p6891
aS'it follows from the simple logic of science that this foundation will be stronger and more stable'
p6892
aS'it can support a much taller structure of development'
p6893
aS'that is why i speak of cooperative federalism when the centre and the states are partners'
p6894
aS'i also speak of cooperative and competitive federalism in which states compete with each other to attract investments and jobs'
p6895
aS'we have moved quickly in the past year to give shape to this vision'
p6896
aS'when we replaced the old planning commission with the institution called niti ayog we gave a formal place and role for state governments in an institution of this nature for the first time in india'
p6897
aS'we have radically increased the amount of resources that the central government must transfer to the state governments'
p6898
aS'and when we began to raise large revenues from the auction of our coal it also filled the coffers of the states where the mines are located'
p6899
aS'i am asking my ministries to move conferences out of delhi to state capitals and other cities so that they do get the benefits that come from hosting such events'
p6900
aS'more than anything else we deal with the state governments in a spirit of partnership and with sensitivity to their concerns'
p6901
aS'and in doing so we do not look at the symbol of the political party that is in power in the state'
p6902
aS'which is why when i invited state governments to participate in this event i did considered the linkages of their states with china but also broader political representation'
p6903
aS'every nation needs strong international partnerships for its progress'
p6904
aS'the linkage has deepened in an integrated world'
p6905
aS'as international partnerships in trade investments innovation technology tourism education skills and health grow state governments have a stake in them and responsibility for their success'
p6906
aS'i have found both through outbound and inbound state delegations that state level interactions can be often more focused and productive'
p6907
aS'a number of decisions can be taken quickly by the state governments'
p6908
aS'these interactions also make the state governments more sensitive and aware of the international dynamics and requirements'
p6909
aS'therefore i attach great significance to this forum'
p6910
aS'it is the first that india has with any country'
p6911
aS'and it is appropriate that it has started with china'
p6912
aS'we are two of the worlds largest economies and among its fastest growing major economies'
p6913
aS'we have enormous economic synergies'
p6914
aS'we also face similar challenges'
p6915
aS'we have some similar experiences'
p6916
aS'we have both seen differences in the pace of development in different parts of our countries'
p6917
aS'our economic relations are growing rapidly'
p6918
aS'during president xis visit last year we set for ourselves an ambitious plan to take our economic relations to a new level'
p6919
aS'we agreed on china setting up two industrial parks in india in maharashtra and gujarat'
p6920
aS'we are pleased that both chief ministers are here'
p6921
aS'we have agreed on cooperation in the upgrading of indias railway sector'
p6922
aS'i have invited chinese companies to invest in indias manufacturing sector'
p6923
aS'president xi spoke of 20 billion dollars of chinese investments over the next five years'
p6924
aS'some of the business agreements will take shape in shanghai tomorrow'
p6925
aS'i believe it will be much easier to translate our vision into reality if provincial and state governments come into closer contacts'
p6926
aS'it will also serve our other interests especially promoting greater people-to-people contacts which is at the heart of all relationships'
p6927
aS'between india and china we already have sister-state relationships between gujarat and guangdong'
p6928
aS'we also have a number of sister-city relations'
p6929
aS'during this visit we will see the launch of karnataka sichuan relations and four sister-city relationships'
p6930
aS'it is also consistent with this spirit that president xi began his visit to india in ahmedabad and i started this visit in xian'
p6931
aS'these are welcome developments'
p6932
aS'we are truly taking our relationship outside our national capitals to state capitals and cities'
p6933
aS'so it is a great pleasure for me to join premier li in launching this forum'
p6934
aS'it will have our full support'
p6935
aS'and i wish it all success'
p6936
aS'thank you'

p6948
aS'but we have a historic responsibility to turn this relationship into a source of strength for each other and a force of good for the world'

p6952

p6953

p6954
aS'i suggested that china should take a strategic and long term view of our relations'
p6955
aS'i found the chinese leadership responsive'
p6956

aS'this is consistent with my firm commitment to cooperative federalism in india'
p6981
aS'this is the year of india in china the next one will be the year of china in india'
p6982
aS'this will expand tourism between our two countries'

p6984
aS'the nathu la route for indian pilgrims to visit kailash mansarovar will become operational in june'
p6985
aS'i want to thank china for that'
p6986
aS'our decision to open a consulates in chengdu and chennai reflects growing mutual confidence and shared commitment to expand our relationship'
p6987
aS'these steps will help make our relationship more broad-based and people-centric'
p6988
aS'finally we have many common global and regional interests'
p6989
aS'for example we have a shared interest in the outcome of the international climate change negotiations'
p6990
aS'we are both trying to strengthen regional connectivity'
p6991
aS'terrorism is a shared threat'
p6992
aS'instability in west asia matters to both of us'
p6993
aS'peace and progress in afghanistan benefits us both'
p6994
aS'i am confident that our international partnership will deepen'
p6995
aS'today we have signed over 20 agreements covering diverse areas of cooperation'
p6996
aS'this shows the depth and maturity of our relationship and the positive direction of our partnership'
p6997
aS'this has been a very productive and positive visit'
p6998
aS'i look forward to working with president xi and premier li'
p6999
aS'i have welcomed president xis proposal to hold regular summits to realize our vision for the relationship'
p7000
aS'i have also invited premier li to visit india at an early date'
p7001
aS'i look forward to shanghai tomorrow'
p7002
aS'thank you'
p7003
aS'thank you very much'
p7004
aS'qiu yong president of tsinghua university foreign minister wang yi shi yigong assistant president of tsinghua university i am truly delighted to be at the tsinghua university today'
p7005
aS'you are a world class institution'
p7006
aS'you are a symbol of success of chinas education sector'
p7007
aS'you are the foundation for chinas economic miracle'
p7008
aS'you have produced great leaders including president xi'
p7009
aS'it is not surprising that chinas economic growth and its new leadership in research science and technology have taken place together'
p7010
aS'i particularly like the old chinese saying if you think in terms of a year plant a seed if you think in terms of ten years plant trees if you think in terms of 100 years teach the people'
p7011
aS'in india too the ancient saying is vyaye krate vardhate eva nityam vidhya dhanam sarva dhan pradhanam the wealth that increases by giving that wealth is knowledge and is supreme of all possessions'
p7012
aS'this is one example of how our two nations are united in their timeless wisdom'
p7013
aS'there is much more though that links our two ancient civilizations'
p7014
aS'i began my journey in china in xian'
p7015
aS'in doing so i retraced the footsteps of the chinese monk xuanzang'
p7016
aS'he travelled to india from xian in the seventh century in search of knowledge and returned to xian as a friend and chronicler of india'
p7017
aS'president xis visit in india last september started from ahmedabad'
p7018
aS'it is not far from vadnagar my birthplace but important because it hosted xuanzang and many pilgrims from china'
p7019
aS'the worlds first large scale educational exchange programme took place between india and china during the tang dynasty'
p7020
aS'records talk of about 80 indian monks coming to china and nearly 150 chinese monks returning after their education in india'
p7021
aS'and yes this was in the 10th and 11th century'
p7022
aS'mumbais rise as a port and a shipbuilding centre is because of cotton trade with china'
p7023
aS'and those who love silk and textiles know that indias famous tanchoi sarees owe themselves to three brothers from my state of gujarat who learnt the art of weaving from chinese masters in the 19th century'
p7024
aS'and in an unquestionable evidence of our ancient trade silk in our classical sanskrit language is called cinapatta'
p7025
aS'so the centuries-old story of our relations has been of spiritualism learning art and trade'
p7026
aS'it is a picture of respect for each others civilisation and of shared prosperity'
p7027
aS'it is reflected in the human values of dr'
p7028
aS'dwarkanath kotnis a doctor from india who treated soldiers in china during the second world war'
p7029
aS'today after difficult and sometimes dark passages of history india and china stand at a rare moment of vast and multiple transitions in the world'
p7030
aS'perhaps the most significant change of this era is the re-emergence of china and india'
p7031
aS'the worlds two most populous nations are undergoing economic and social transformation on a scale and at a speed that is unmatched in history'
p7032
aS'chinas success over the past three decades has changed the character of the global economy'
p7033
aS'india is now the next frontier of the economic revolution'
p7034
aS'we have the demography for it'
p7035
aS'about 800 million people in india are below the age of 35 years'
p7036
aS'their aspirations energy enterprise and skills will be the force for indias economic transformation'
p7037
aS'we now have the political mandate and the will to make it happen'
p7038
aS'over the past year we have moved with a clear and coherent vision'
p7039
aS'and we have acted with speed resolve and boldness to implement it'
p7040
aS'we have taken sweeping steps to reform our policies and open up more to foreign direct investments'
p7041
aS'this includes new areas like insurance construction defence and railways'
p7042
aS'we are eliminating unnecessary regulations and simplifying our procedures'
p7043
aS'we are using digital technology to eliminate multiple approvals and endless wait'
p7044
aS'we are building a tax regime that is predictable stable and competitive and that will integrate the indian market'
p7045
aS'we are scaling up investments in next generation infrastructure roads ports railways airports telecom digital networks and clean energy'
p7046
aS'our resources are being allocated with speed and transparency'
p7047
aS'and we will make sure that land acquisition does not become a barrier to growth or a burden on farmers'
p7048
aS'we are creating the global skill pool to establish a modern economy with a world class manufacturing sector'
p7049
aS'we are reviving our agriculture sector to restore the fortunes of our farmers and boost our growth'
p7050
aS'like china urban renewal is both a necessity and a means to add energy to our economy'
p7051
aS'we are combining traditional strategies with modern economic instruments to eliminate poverty and create security for the poor'
p7052
aS'we have launched major schemes on financial inclusion of all providing funds to the un-banked and ensuring efficient and direct transfer of benefits to the poor'
p7053
aS'and we are ensuring that insurance and pension schemes reach the poorest'
p7054
aS'we have set time bound goals for providing access to housing water and sanitation for all'
p7055
aS'this wont just transform lives but also generate a new source of economic momentum'
p7056
aS'above all we are changing the way we govern ourselves not just in the way we work in new delhi but also in the way we work together with state governments districts and cities'
p7057
aS'because we know as you do that our vision may be formed in delhi but our success will be determined by state capitals'
p7058
aS'that is why i am here today with two chief ministers which is a new aspect of our foreign policy'
p7059
aS'and for the first time for india premier li and i will sit with provincial leaders and chief ministers to discuss our partnership'
p7060
aS'i know that rewriting policies can be easier than changing mindsets and work culture'
p7061
aS'but we are on the right path'
p7062
aS'you will feel the change in india'
p7063
aS'and you can see it in our growth rate'
p7064
aS'it has now increased to 7'
p7065
aS'5 and we are encouraged by international experts speak in one voice of higher growth rates'
p7066
aS'in many ways our two countries reflect the same aspirations similar challenges and the same opportunities'
p7067
aS'we can be inspired by each others successes'
p7068
aS'and in the global uncertainties of our times we can reinforce each others progress'
p7069
aS'perhaps no other economy in the world offers such opportunities for the future as indias'
p7070
aS'and few partnerships are as filled with promise as ours'
p7071
aS'during president xis visit last september we set for ourselves a new level of ambition for our cooperation'
p7072
aS'partnership in modernizing indian railways two chinese industrial parks in india commitments of 20 billion dollars in investments into india over the next five years partnership in our make in india mission this is the shape of our future'
p7073
aS'tomorrow in shanghai we will see the agreements on first of those partnerships between our industries'
p7074
aS'but to maintain this partnership over the long run we must also improve the access of indian industry to the chinese market'
p7075
aS'i am encouraged by president xis and premier lis commitment to resolve this problem'
p7076
aS'as much as our bilateral cooperation our international partnership will be important for each others success'
p7077
aS'our changing world has created new opportunities and challenges'
p7078
aS'we both face instability in our shared neighbourhood that can threaten our security and slow down our economies'
p7079
aS'the spreading tide of extremism and terrorism is a threat we both face for both its source is in the same region'
p7080
aS'we must also deal with the changing character of terrorism that has made it less predictable and more diffuse'
p7081
aS'we source a large part of our energy from the same region that faces instability and uncertain future'
p7082
aS'india and china conduct their international commerce on the same sea lanes'
p7083
aS'the security of sea lanes is vital for our two economies and our cooperation is essential to achieve it'
p7084
aS'equally we both seek to connect a fragmented asia'
p7085
aS'there are projects we will pursue individually'
p7086
aS'there are few such as the bangladesh china india myanmar corridor that we are doing jointly'
p7087
aS'but geography and history tell us that the dream of an interconnected asia will be successful when india and china work together'
p7088
aS'we are two countries that have gained a lot from an open rule-based global trading system'
p7089
aS'equally we have most to lose if it breaks down'
p7090
aS'we both have enormous stakes in the international negotiations on climate change'
p7091
aS'our cooperation in these forums will be crucial to shape their outcomes'
p7092
aS'today we speak of asias resurgence'
p7093
aS'it is the result of the rise of many powers in the region at the same time'
p7094
aS'it is an asia of great promise but also many uncertainties'
p7095
aS'asias re- emergence is leading to a multi-polar world that we both welcome'
p7096
aS'but it is also an unpredictable and complex environment of shifting equations'
p7097
aS'we can be more certain of a peaceful and stable future for asia if india and china cooperate closely'
p7098
aS'a resurgent asia is seeking a bigger voice in global affairs'
p7099
aS'india and china seek a greater role in the world'
p7100
aS'it may be reforms in the united nations security council or the new asian infrastructure investment bank'
p7101
aS'but asias voice will be stronger and our nations role more influential if india and china speak in one voice - for all of us and for each other'
p7102
aS'simply put the prospects of the 21st century becoming the asian century will depend in large measure on what india and china achieve individually and what we do together'
p7103
aS'the rising fortunes of 2'
p7104
aS'5 billion pairs of joined hands will be of the greatest consequence for our region and the humanity'
p7105
aS'this is the vision that i share with president xi and premier li'
p7106
aS'this is the impulse that is driving our relationship'
p7107
aS'in recent years we have deepened our political engagement'
p7108
aS'we have kept our borders peaceful'
p7109
aS'we have managed our differences and not allowed them to impede closer cooperation'
p7110
aS'we have enhanced our cooperation across the full spectrum of our relationship'
p7111
aS'yet if we have to realise the extraordinary potential of our partnership we must also address the issues that lead to hesitation and doubts even distrust in our relationship'
p7112
aS'first we must try to settle the boundary question quickly'
p7113
aS'we both recognise that this is historys legacy'
p7114
aS'resolving it is our shared responsibility to the future'
p7115
aS'we must move ahead with new purpose and determination'
p7116
aS'the solution we choose should do more than settle the boundary question'
p7117
aS'it should do so in a manner that transforms our relationship and not cause new disruptions'
p7118
aS'we have been remarkably successful in maintaining peace and tranquility along the border'
p7119
aS'we must continue to do that on the principle of mutual and equal security'
p7120
aS'our agreements protocols and border mechanisms have been helpful'
p7121
aS'but a shadow of uncertainty always hangs over the sensitive areas of the border region'
p7122
aS'it is because neither side knows where the line of actual control is in these areas'
p7123
aS'that is why i have proposed resuming the process of clarifying it'
p7124
aS'we can do this without prejudice to our position on the boundary question'
p7125
aS'we should think of creative solutions to issues that have become irritants - from visa policies to trans-border rivers'
p7126
aS'sometimes small steps can have a deep impact on how our people see each other'
p7127
aS'we are both increasing our engagement in our shared neighbourhood'
p7128
aS'this calls for deeper strategic communication to build mutual trust and confidence'
p7129
aS'we must ensure that our relationships with other countries do not become a source of concern for each other'
p7130
aS'and wherever possible and feasible we should work together as we did in responding to the earthquake in nepal'
p7131
aS'if the last century was the age of alliances this is an era of inter-dependence'
p7132
aS'so talks of alliances against one another have no foundation'
p7133
aS'in any case we are both ancient civilizations large and independent nations'
p7134
aS'neither of us can be contained or become part of anyones plans'
p7135
aS'so our partnership in international forums should not be determined by the concerns of others but the interests of our two countries'
p7136
aS'chinas support for indias permanent membership of a reformed un security council and for indias membership of export control regimes like nuclear suppliers group will do more than just strengthen our international cooperation'
p7137
aS'it will take our relationship to a new level'
p7138
aS'it will give asia a stronger voice in the world'
p7139
aS'if we are able to deepen mutual trust and confidence we will also be able to reinforce each others efforts of connecting asia with itself and rest of the world'
p7140
aS'our soldiers face each other on the border but we should also deepen our defence and security cooperation to address our many common challenges'
p7141
aS'above all as we look ahead we must build more bridges of familiarity and comfort between our people'
p7142
aS'about 33 of the worlds population is either indian or chinese'
p7143
aS'yet our people know very little of each other'
p7144
aS'we must seek inspiration from the pilgrims of the ancient times who braved the unknown in search of knowledge and enriched us both'
p7145
aS'so we have decided to extend electronic tourist visas to chinese nationals'
p7146
aS'we are celebrating the year of india in china in 2015'
p7147
aS'we are launching the provincial and state leaders forum today'
p7148
aS'later today we will have the yoga-taichi event'
p7149
aS'it will represent the coming together of our two civilizations'
p7150
aS'we are starting the gandhi and india study centre in fudan university and a college of yoga in kunming'
p7151
aS'the second route to kailash mansarovar for indian pilgrims will start in june for which i want to thank president xi'
p7152
aS'these are just some of the many steps india and china are taking to bring the worlds two largest populations in closer contact'
p7153
aS'for this reason i chose to speak today at a university'
p7154
aS'because it is the youth that will inherit the future of our countries and the responsibility for our relationship'
p7155
aS'president xi has spoken eloquently about the inter-connected dreams of china and india and the new type of relationship between major countries'
p7156
aS'not only are our dreams inter-connected our future is also deeply inter- connected'
p7157
aS'we are at a moment when we have the opportunity to make our choices'
p7158
aS'india and china are two proud civilizations and two great nations that will fulfill their destinies'
p7159
aS'we each have the strength and the will to choose our own paths to success'
p7160
aS'but we have the ancient wisdom to know that our journey will be smoother and our future brighter when we will walk together confident of one another and in step with each other'
p7161
aS'thank you very much and thanks for your invitation thanks a lot'
p7162
aS'all the dignitaries present and dear student friends this is a moment of great happiness for me as i am going to be a part of that pious job which will instill a sense of pride for centuries to come'
p7163
aS'there might be a few leaders in the world that would have an opportunity to interact with the students of two universities in such a short span of three days while visiting other countries as a guest'
p7164
aS'very few people might be as fortunate as i am and i am grateful to you for this'
p7165
aS'the basics of india is philosophy and it is also mentioned in the vedas that the light of knowledge should flow free from all directions'
p7166
aS'our philosophy enunciates gyan bhadro'
p7167
aS'thoughts and knowledge knows no boundaries neither east or west'
p7168
aS'they are eternal and knowledge from any part of the world can be useful for the development of human culture'
p7169
aS'just now two chinese students quoted different slokas from the ancient indian texts'
p7170
aS'they said and i quote nainam chindanti shastrani nainam dahti pavakaha'
p7171
aS'they presented their views in a manner which can act as a storehouse of knowledge for the world'
p7172
aS'the soul is never born the soul never dies'
p7173
aS'the soul can not be destroyed nor can it ever be burnt'
p7174
aS'i understand that the chinese students here summed up the ancient indian philosophy before you'
p7175
aS'they mentioned the gita too which states ma faleshu kadachina meaning to do ones duty wholeheartedly without seeking anything in return'
p7176
aS'it requires intent to study about mahatma gandhi or india'
p7177
aS'and if india and china were to scan the history of their rich cultural heritage we will discover that both were nations of ardent learners they were courageous to gain new knowledge and were ready to take pains for it'
p7178
aS'huen tsang came to india some 1400 years ago and similarly academic indians must have travelled to china and all for the sake of knowledge'
p7179
aS'such boldness was displayed to acquire knowledge to learn about different cultures and traditions'
p7180
aS'it is easy to open the doors for trade and economic reasons'
p7181
aS'it is easy to invite tourists from all over the world'
p7182
aS'but opening the doors for knowledge requires immense courage'
p7183
aS'if one is not strong internally then one is scared of being engulfed by the ideas of others'
p7184
aS'will those ideas overpower us'
p7185
aS'when a person is strong within he is open to the views and ideas of others'
p7186
aS'and so china today after the age of buddha is keen to learn about the great cultural heritage through the life of gandhi i think this in itself is a big and important event'
p7187
aS'those relations that are borne out of economic considerations are profit and loss centric'
p7188
aS'but the relations that are fostered through knowledge work on the principle of welfare of the future generations'
p7189
aS'mahatma gandhi though born in a corner of india was a global figure he was an icon and the various crises that the world is struggling with can his ideologies show a way out'
p7190
aS'the world today is facing two major crises one is global warming and the other is terrorism'
p7191
aS'gandhis ideologies have solution to both these problems which means the students of this university through gandhian study can outline the relevance of gandhi in todays age through mankind not just for china but for the world'
p7192
aS'a chinese person mr zen centi admired gandhi and came to live in sabarmati ashram in 1925'
p7193
aS'he stayed there as gandhijis disciple'
p7194
aS'the ashram inmates could not pronounce his name correctly for it was a chinese name'
p7195
aS'so mahatma gandhi wrote his name as shanti jain'
p7196
aS'similarly a chinese scholar tang yung shan was close to rabindra nath tagore'
p7197
aS'he has written that when he met mahatma gandhi gandhiji was full of praise for china'
p7198
aS'zen centi after staying with mahatma gandhi returned to china and started a newspaper by the name penang'
p7199
aS'in 1930 gandhiji was fighting a big battle for indias independence'
p7200
aS'he was lodged in yerwada jail in pune and was on a fast unto death in the jail'
p7201
aS'when zen centi learned about it he immediately came to india and requested to meet gandhiji'
p7202
aS'gandhiji had refused to meet anyone inside the jail during his fast'
p7203
aS'but such was his love for zen centi that gandhiji met him in the jail'
p7204
aS'such was his love for a chinese citizen'
p7205
aS'21st century belongs to asia'
p7206
aS'china and india together make for a third of the worlds population'
p7207
aS'if this one third population is benefitted and is free of problems then a third of the world will be freed of crises'
p7208
aS'so india and china should together scale new heights with humanitarian approach with humanity based on buddhist ideology and gandhian experiments so that we can inspire the world to lead a life which is committed to the welfare of the world'
p7209
aS'my heartfelt congratulations to fudan university towards their efforts to start this new segment'
p7210
aS'i believe that our thoughts will enhance and strengthen the indo chinese relations in the times to come for the coming generations'
p7211
aS'with this belief my best wishes to all of you once again'
p7212
aS'thank you very much'
p7213
aS'excellency prime minister chimad saikhanbileg members of the cabinet distinguished guests this is a memorable day for india for my delegation and me'
p7214

p7222
aS'for the first time i have seen thousands of people of the host nation come together'
p7223
aS'and that too for an event based on indias ancient tradition'
p7224
aS'today 1'
p7225
aS'25 billion people of india and the world have come to see the strength and the spirit of our relationship'
p7226
aS'ours is a relationship that is not measured on the scale of commerce or driven by competition against others'
p7227
aS'it is a relationship of immeasurable positive energy that comes from our spiritual links and shared ideals'
p7228
aS'it is the energy that seeks the well being of our two nations and the common good of the world'
p7229
aS'this is a form of energy that has enormous power to be the force of peace progress and prosperity in the world'
p7230
aS'it is a force that can unite the world and direct our thoughts and efforts to the well being of the weak and the poor'
p7231
aS'it can help preserve our beautiful planet'
p7232
aS'the importance of a journey is not measured by the distance covered but by the destination reached'
p7233
aS'the visit may be short'
p7234
aS'but the outcomes are substantive and significant'
p7235
aS'in the course of one day we have imparted our ancient relations new strength and momentum'
p7236
aS'our political understanding and commitment have become stronger'
p7237
aS'our economic cooperation has scaled new heights'
p7238
aS'our security cooperation has expanded'
p7239
aS'the ties of hearts and minds have deepened'
p7240
aS'excellency all this would not have been possible without the great leaders of mongolia'
p7241
aS'you have guided mongolia through the turbulence that comes from transitions in history'
p7242
aS'you have chosen the path of democracy'
p7243
aS'you have rekindled the spiritual heritage of your land'

aS'it spoke of the special bonds between our countries'
p7248
aS'this is a bond that will be the eternal flame of light and hope for our people and our world'
p7249
aS'so as we celebrate 25 years of democracy in mongolia and 60 years of our diplomatic relations we know that the best for relationship lies ahead of us'
p7250
aS'with those words let me raise a toast- to the health and well being of the prime minister of mongolia his excellency prime minister saikhanbileg- to the progress and prosperity of our spiritual neighbours of mongolia- to the everlasting friendship between the people of india and mongolia'

p7265
aS'india and mongolia are at an important milestone'
p7266
aS'we are celebrating sixty years of diplomatic relations'

aS'around two thousand years ago monks from india crossed difficult terrain and long distance to spread the message of lord buddha in this enchanting land'
p7269
aS'many went from here to the hot tropics of india in search of spiritual knowledge'
p7270

p7281
aS'in turn time and again you have stood in solidarity with us in the united nations and elsewhere'
p7282
aS'while the human bonds have been strong our economic ties have been modest'
p7283
aS'but i have no doubt that our relations will progress along every avenue of the new age'
p7284
aS'it will draw strength from indias economic growth'
p7285
aS'a year ago a nation of 1'
p7286
aS'25 billion people voted for change and progress in the largest democratic election in human history'
p7287
aS'we have worked with speed resolve and ambition to fulfill our pledge'

p7292
aS'we are conscious that our challenges are vast across indias immense social and economic diversity'
p7293
aS'but we have faith in our sound policies and good governance'
p7294
aS'we draw confidence from the unity of our nation and the common purpose of our people'
p7295
aS'even more we get our energy from the aspirations of a young india with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years'
p7296
aS'they are eager to pursue their dreams and confident in their ability to do so'
p7297
aS'so as we transform the lives of our people we also create opportunities for the world'
p7298
aS'and we increase our ability to help our friends'
p7299
aS'this is the urge of the land of buddha and gandhi'
p7300
aS'this is the instinct born from our ancient belief in the world as one family'
p7301
aS'as the indian economy adds strength to our region and the world it will also benefit mongolia'
p7302
aS'mongolias economic growth is also impressive'
p7303
aS'so our bilateral ties will also grow despite the distance and demands of geography'
p7304
aS'mongolias rich mineral resources can fuel our partnership'
p7305

p7312
aS'more than just trade and investment our development partnership is a reflection of our shared ideals and vision'
p7313
aS'i believe that the greatest form of this partnership is investment in the development of human resources and institutions'
p7314
aS'this gives a nation its own capacity to shoulder the responsibility for its progress'
p7315
aS'it enhances its independence of choice'
p7316
aS'and it makes progress more sustainable'
p7317
aS'we remain deeply committed to this vision'
p7318
aS'today i will lay the foundation stone for the expansion and upgrading of the atal bihari vajpayee centre for excellence in information and communication technology'

aS'finally today i conveyed to prime minister our decision to provide one billion u'
p7325
aS's'
p7326
aS'dollars line of credit to develop institutions infrastructure and human resources in mongolia'
p7327
aS'our security cooperation is growing'

p7332
aS'we have also agreed that india will help establish a cyber security centre in mongolias defence and security establishment'
p7333
aS'but the real strength of our relationship lies in the goodwill between our people and in the faith that unites us across the distances'
p7334
aS'it is a power that can do more than just draw our two countries closer'
p7335
aS'it can help advance peace stability and prosperity in asia and the pacific region'
p7336
aS'there was a time when the messengers of lord buddha linked asia with his message of love and compassion'
p7337
aS'the shifting sands of time have not buried their footprints because the value of their message never diminishes'
p7338
aS'wherever i have travelled in asia - from the edge of pacific to the centre of the indian ocean from the sea shores of southeast asia to the lofty heights of the himalaya from the thick forests of the tropics to the expanse of these steppes - i see thriving monuments and temples dedicated to lord buddha'
p7339
aS'the eight-fold path of lord buddha prescribes not just the path to happiness of individuals but also a guide to the well being of societies and nations'
p7340
aS'it is a message of kindness love and compassion for all'
p7341
aS'it is a lesson of deepest respect for human beings and human rights for faith in peace and non-violence'
p7342
aS'this is a path that tells us to reach out to the weakest and the poorest in our societies'
p7343
aS'it is a wisdom that sees the inter-dependence of all things in the universe and the virtue of simplicity'
p7344
aS'therefore it is a path to a more a sustainable planet'
p7345
aS'it holds lessons for the world that is threatened by the excesses of consumption and disharmony between man and nature'
p7346
aS'as in the prosperous west asia of rising incomes and aspirations must remember and follow this message'
p7347
aS'above all it is a guide for a relationship of peace equality respect and cooperation between nations small and large weak and powerful'
p7348
aS'it is a call for each of us as individuals and as nations to assume the universal responsibility to mankind and our planet'
p7349
aS'it inspires us to think of common good of all nations'
p7350
aS'the teachings of lord buddha are reflected in the principles of democracy'
p7351
aS'the path of righteousness is based on freedom of mind liberty of thought liberty of action and liberty of speech'
p7352
aS'these are the foundations of democracy'
p7353
aS'it is defined by recognition of inter-dependence acceptance of diversity and belief in co- existence'
p7354
aS'its essence is the freedom of human beings faith in dialogue rule of law and resolution of differences through peaceful means'
p7355
aS'so if we follow the right path of the master it will also be natural to walk on the path of democratic values'
p7356
aS'here in mongolia we see the union of these two ideals'
p7357
aS'i say this to asia whatever forms of government each nation chooses however we define ourselves as a state we can still apply the principles of democracy in our engagement with each other'
p7358
aS'whatever path we have chosen whatever be the history of our disputes or the nature of our claims we are linked by the common spiritual heritage across a vast arc of asia'
p7359
aS'the convergence of buddhism and democracy provides us a path to build an asia of peace and cooperation harmony and equality'
p7360
aS'this is a region that has woken up to its destiny'
p7361
aS'no region in the world has seen so much progress in the last half century as asia'
p7362
aS'no age has seen transformation on such scale in one generation as our continent'
p7363
aS'this is a region of ancient wisdom and youthful dynamism it is a continent that is expected to lead the world in the 21st century'
p7364
aS'yet this is also a region that lives on the uneasy edge of uncertainty of unsettled questions of unresolved disputes and unforgotten memories'
p7365
aS'across asias diversity we also see growing disparity of hope and opportunities'
p7366
aS'asia has given much to the world through the ages'
p7367
aS'it now has the responsibility to shape its future'
p7368
aS'so now more than our own requirements i am sure we will be able to do the requirements that asia wants from us and the world thinks about us'
p7369
aS'and i am sure that with our spiritual background and our extraordinary quality of the mind we can serve the world and society'

aS'our vision of inclusive growth will be incomplete unless we pool our innovation and technologies to transform our regions agriculture'

p7539
aS'by 2025 a majority of asians will live in cities'
p7540
aS'many urban clusters in asia will exceed the population of mid-sized countries elsewhere in the world'
p7541
aS'by then by some estimates india will host around 11 of the global urban population'

aS'so creating livable and sustainable cities of tomorrow should be our collective goal'
p7543

p7701
aS'last time in mann ki baat i had requested you to send me memorable pictures if you go out on a vacation anywhere in india and if you happen to find them kindly post them under the incredible india hashtag'
p7702
aS'when isaid that i had never imagined that it would get such an immense response'
p7703
aS'lakhs of people have posted photos on twitter facebook and instagram'
p7704
aS'i can say that india is full of diversities and i was able to witness so many magnificent scenes in those pictures be it of architecture art nature waterfalls mountains rivers or seas'
p7705
aS'government of india had never thought that in terms of tourism you all could contribute in such a massive way'
p7706
aS'i liked some pictures so much that i re-tweeted them'
p7707
aS'and as i understand if some one would not have posted the picture of belum caves in andhra pradesh many people would have never come to know that something like that exists in our country'
p7708
aS'madhya pradeshs orcha fort is another example of that'
p7709
aS'we assume rajasthan to be a state with scarcity of water but when someone sends a photo of menal waterfall it is a matter of great surprise'
p7710
aS'really a tremendous work has been done'
p7711
aS'we will promote and also continue doing such work and the entire world will watch it entire nation will watch it and our new generation will also watch it'
p7712
aS'my beloved countrymen though you have elected me as the prime minister of the country but at times the human in me shuns all posts and prestige associated with it and submerges oneself within it'
p7713
aS'i can say that 21st june the international yoga day affected me in the same manner'
p7714
aS'at that time when i proposed the international yoga day it was just an idea'
p7715
aS'but the scene that was witnessed on 21st june was such that wherever the sun dawned wherever its rays reached there was not a single landmass wherein it was not welcomed by way of yoga'
p7716
aS'we can say with conviction that the sun never sets in the world of yoga practitioners'
p7717
aS'the way yoga was received and was welcomed with open arms around the world there would not be any indian who would not be proud of it'
p7718
aS'i too got delighted'
p7719
aS'and when the people of france chose river seine and eiffel tower in which they take pride to do yoga they gave an equal status to it as river siene and eifel tower'
p7720
aS'in new york people did yoga at times square'
p7721
aS'if we think about sydney australia then the picture of opera house comes to our mind'
p7722
aS'the citizens of australia gave equal respect to yoga and did yoga at the opera house'
p7723
aS'whether it is north america silicon valley or milans duomo cathedral it is a matter of great pride for us'
p7724
aS'on 21st june when i saw mr ban ki-moon un secretary general doing yoga at un headquarters i was really delighted'
p7725
aS'similarly un peace keeping force did a spectacular display of yoga'
p7726
aS'in india our soldiers too were doing yoga in siachen on white sheet of snow and on sea too wherever our naval ships are posted the yoga program was being carried out by indian navy'
p7727
aS'delhi made it to the guinness book of world records'
p7728
aS'rajpath turned into the yogpath that day'
p7729
aS'i am thankful to india and the rest of the world and can say that the international yoga day was not for namesake'
p7730
aS'it seemed as if that from every corner of the world there was a new inquisitiveness new joy new hope and new connection'
p7731
aS'few days back when i tweeted a photo of a vietnamese child doing yoga it was such a sweet photo that it got a lot of attention from the entire world'
p7732
aS'everybody be it men-women old-young village-city developed or developing countries everybody got connected with it'
p7733
aS'yoga in true terms became the core reason to connect the entire world'
p7734
aS'i do not know how the intellectual class elites of the world would analyze this event'
p7735
aS'but i can feel and every indian can experience that the whole world is very curious to know more about india'
p7736
aS'curiosity towards india has increased'
p7737
aS'the world wants to know about the values the rituals and the heritage of india'
p7738
aS'it is our responsibility that without any artificiality we share our legacy and introduce ourselves to the world'
p7739
aS'we can only do this when we ourselves are proud of our traditions'
p7740
aS'at times we are so familiar with our values that we dont feel there is anything new in them but we ourselves do not know that our family values are considered to be a big thing in the entire world'
p7741
aS'why dont we familiarize the outside world with our family values'
p7742
aS'the world would be very surprised to know about them'
p7743
aS'i am sure they would be intrigued'
p7744
aS'there are many things that our forefathers have given to us which are the best and the entire world also has the right on those things'
p7745
aS'the success of international yoga day has brought in a new responsibility along with it'
p7746
aS'it is our responsibility that we gift supreme yoga teachers to the world'
p7747
aS'it is our responsibility that we can see the entire tradition of yoga on one platform from the universe'
p7748
aS'i request the youngsters especially the it professionals that all of you should come together to create an online yoga activity program'
p7749
aS'we all should come to know about all the yoga organizations yoga teachers and all the necessary information about the yoga from this online program'
p7750
aS'one database must be prepared and i believe you can do it'
p7751
aS'one must start from somewhere and it would surely turn out to be a great power'
p7752
aS'i have seen and learnt from the perspective of recent occurrences that a government that works and the government that is action-oriented can bring in results if the targets are set'
p7753
aS'we should not forget that the only voice that could be heard one year ago was that nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens'
p7754
aS'can you imagine that there is a department under government named ayush'
p7755
aS'nobody has paid attention towards this department'
p7756
aS'the only mention ayush in some corner of the newspaper being a small department is once in 2 to 5 years'
p7757
aS'but it led on the international yoga day'
p7758
aS'it was this small department that organized this event in the entire world'
p7759
aS'therefore this is an example that if there is an aim then even a small department can do a supreme job'
p7760
aS'in the last few days the world saw how we saved people from yemen to afghanistan'
p7761
aS'in a few hours- we reached nepal and helped people over there'
p7762
aS'when people wanted to open an bank account under the governments new scheme of jan dhan yojana how the people working in bank helped them to do so and connected millions of indians to the bank'
p7763
aS'on 15th august last year when i appealed from the red fort for toilets in schools i had said that by next 15th august we have to complete this task'
p7764
aS'the work which could not be completed in last 60 years was promised to be completed by the end of one year'
p7765
aS'the promise was really daring'
p7766
aS'almost four and half lakh toilets were to be built but i can say it with satisfaction that though 15th august is still far off the work of constructing toilets by the people is on the verge of completion'
p7767
aS'this means that the government people and government workers all want to work for the country'
p7768
aS'if we pledge to work in an unselfish manner welfare for all happiness for all then the government will also work efficiently'
p7769
aS'the people who are a part of the government will also work efficiently and the people of the nation will welcome them with open arms'
p7770
aS'i have experienced this'
p7771
aS'this is the true strength that drives a nation forward'
p7772
aS'last month we had launched three insurance schemes'
p7773
aS'i had launched them from kolkata and it has received such a commendable response in such a short span of time'
p7774
aS'there have been very few steps which have been taken from the perspective of social security but by way of these three schemes we are taking a big leap'
p7775
aS'in such a short time span more than 10 crore people have become a part of these schemes but we have to take it further'
p7776
aS'i have a thought which i want to put forth before you'
p7777
aS'rakshabandhan comes in the month of august'
p7778
aS'cant we start a massive movement before this festival and make every women be it our mother or sister a part of this thereby giving benefit to them under this insurance program'
p7779
aS'be it a sister who is a domestic help in your home or your own sister why cant we gift them a rs'
p7780
aS'12 or rs'
p7781
aS'330 scheme on rakshabandhan for their entire life'
p7782
aS'this can be a big gift for a sister from their brother'
p7783
aS'why cant we set the eve of rakshabandhan as a target and in a number of 2 crore 5 crore 7 crore and 10 crore try to reach the sisters so that they can reap the benefit of this scheme'
p7784
aS'lets come together and try to work together towards the completion of this pledge'
p7785
aS'whenever i hold a mann ki baat session many people send me suggestions'
p7786
aS'this time many people have suggested that i say something about the monsoons'
p7787
aS'yogesh dandekar from nagpur harshvardhan ji from mysore praveen nadkarni ji divyanshu gupta ji have all asked me to say something about the monsoon in this session of mann ki baat'
p7788
aS'they have sent in some really good suggestions'
p7789
aS'and this is a season of happiness'
p7790
aS'and each one of us whatever the age is definitely tempted to enjoy the first showers of the monsoon'
p7791
aS'i am sure you too might be enjoying the rains with bhajiyas pakoras corn and a hot cup of tea'
p7792
aS'just as the rays of the sun give us life similarly rainfall provide us life and sustenance'
p7793
aS'every drop of water is precious'
p7794
aS'as a responsible citizen and as a member of the society we will have to cultivate the habit of conserving every drop of water'
p7795
aS'it should be our pledge that water from the villages stays in the villages and water for the cities remains available for them'
p7796
aS'if the rain water does not flow away it goes into the earth then the aquifers get recharged and the year long water woes get resolved'
p7797
aS'rain water harvesting is not a new concept'
p7798
aS'it is being practiced over the centuries'
p7799
aS'be it check dams watershed development small lakes or the small ponds in fields we need to save the precious waters everywhere'
p7800
aS'i always tell people that if you go to porbander the birth place of mahatma gandhi you will be able to see a two hundred year old underground water tank which got directly recharged with the rain water'
p7801
aS'you can still see it'
p7802
aS'if you ever go there do visit the place'
p7803
aS'and you will find that even after two hundred years it is still functional brimming with water and the water does not even stagnate'
p7804
aS'porbander is a coastal city so potable water was collected through the rains for the entire year'
p7805
aS'even in those times such a lot of care was taken'
p7806
aS'we can too do the same'
p7807
aS'this should in fact become a mass movement'
p7808
aS'each and every village should have the facilities for rain water harvesting'
p7809
aS'similarly we find greenery so pleasing to our eyes'
p7810
aS'we all like greener surroundings'
p7811
aS'gardens and trees bring in an element of freshness in our lives'
p7812
aS'this monsoon season there should be mass plant sowing campaigns conducted by youth and social organizations'
p7813
aS'and i can take a leaf from my personal experience and offer you a suggestion which has been very successful'
p7814
aS'this is an intensely rural technology'
p7815
aS'whenever you sow a plant place an earthen pot near it'
p7816
aS'you just need to fill it once or twice in a month'
p7817
aS'you will see how fast the plant grows into a lush green tree'
p7818
aS'i have even been telling the farmers to plant trees on the boundaries of their fields instead of putting barricades'
p7819
aS'these will become your biggest asset in the long run'
p7820
aS'it is true that rains are enjoyable and bring in a lot of fun at the same time'
p7821
aS'it is also true that rains also bring in many diseases'
p7822
aS'doctors get to see so many patients that they hardly get the time to breathe'
p7823
aS'we all know that rains cause many water borne diseases'
p7824
aS'increased moisture in the environment leads to bacterial growth and so keeping the environment clean becomes important'
p7825
aS'cleanliness is very important in monsoons'
p7826
aS'it is often requested to consume safe drinking water'
p7827
aS'most of the people boil and drink water during this season'
p7828
aS'it has its own benefits'
p7829
aS'and this is true that the more care we take healthier we would be'
p7830
aS'we need monsoons and we need water but we also need to stay healthy'
p7831
aS'dear citizens we have recently launched three schemes for the people in the cities'
p7832
aS'we have around 500 small cities'
p7833
aS'our policy is waste to wealth'
p7834
aS'we can earn from waste too'
p7835
aS'garbage can be recycled to make fertilizers bricks and even electricity'
p7836
aS'contaminated water can be recycled to make it clent and be used for irrigation in the fields'
p7837
aS'we have to take this movement forward'
p7838
aS'in the amrut scheme we have launched a massive campaign and taken up initiatives to improve the quality of life in our cities'
p7839
aS'we should become a country which is able to match the living standards of the world'
p7840
aS'we should have smart cities comparable to world standards'
p7841
aS'and yet at the same time the poorest of poor person should have an accommodation of his own and that too complete with water electricity sanitation and access to a school'
p7842
aS'in 2022 when india celebrates its 75 years of independence we wish that every indian has a house of his own'
p7843
aS'keeping all this in mind we have launched three major schemes'
p7844
aS'i am positive that these schemes will bring about a qualitative difference in the lives of the urban people'
p7845
aS'i am myself connected to you via the social media'
p7846
aS'i keep getting many new suggestions and new ideas and also good and bad information about our government'
p7847
aS'and sometimes it so happens that a small comment from an individual in some remote village in india conveys something that just touches our hearts'
p7848
aS'you are aware that the government has launched beti bachao beti padhao programme'
p7849
aS'but you cant imagine the force that is lent to the programme when a village or a society adopts it'
p7850
aS'a few days back a sarpanch in a small remote village of haryana sri sunil jaglan ji launched selfie with daughter campaign'
p7851
aS'such an environment was created that every father wished to click a selfie of himself with his daughter and post it on the social media'
p7852
aS'i liked this idea and that too for a special reason'
p7853
aS'in haryana the number of girls in comparison to boys is dismally low'
p7854
aS'around another 100 districts in the country have a similar dismal situation of skewed sex ratio'
p7855
aS'but it is the worst in haryana'
p7856
aS'in that very same haryana if a sarpanch of a small indistinct village lends this meaning to the beti bachao beti padhao programme then i certainly get overwhelmed'
p7857
aS'it makes me so happy and it gives me a new hope and i do express my happiness'
p7858
aS'i request you all to take a selfie with your daughter and post it on selfie with daughter'
p7859
aS'and do not forget to post a tagline around the theme of beti bachao beti padhao with it whatever be the language it can be in hindi english your mother tongue or your native language'
p7860
aS'and i promise to re-tweet the most inspirational tagline with you and your daughters selfie'
p7861
aS'we can turn beti bachao beti padhao into a mass movement'
p7862
aS'i urge you all to take forward the programme launched by sri sunil in bibipur village of haryana'
p7863
aS'i request you all to post on selfie with daughter'
p7864
aS'lets us all enjoy the rising honour and prestige of our daughters and see how joyful this entire experience of beti bachao beti padhao becomes'
p7865
aS'let us all rid ourselves of this bad name that we have for not respecting our daughters'

aS'like kazakhstan the rest of central asia is on the rise'

p7961
aS'the countries of central asia are endowed with rich human and natural resources'
p7962
aS'i am coming from tashkent'
p7963
aS'uzbekistan is experiencing rapid economic growth and progress'

p7966
aS'your success is as important for the region as it is for the world'
p7967
aS'central asia is at the crossroads of eurasia'
p7968
aS'it has been caught in the currents of history and it has also shaped it'
p7969
aS'it has seen rise and fall of empires'
p7970
aS'it has witnessed trade thrive and ebb'
p7971
aS'for monks merchants and monarchs it has been both - a destination and a passage'
p7972
aS'it has been an intermediary of cultures and faiths from across asia'
p7973
aS'your gifts to human civilisation have been rich'
p7974
aS'your imprint on human progress has been lasting'
p7975
aS'and over the last two thousand years and more india and central asia have influenced each other profoundly'

aS'many of you wait for the release of the latest bollywood film with the same excitement as people in india'
p7992
aS'this is the source of goodwill between our people'
p7993
aS'it is the foundation of a relationship of hearts and emotions'
p7994
aS'and it can not be measured only by the scale of trade or the demands of states'
p7995
aS'it was evident when president nazarbayev and the leaders of other central asian republics came to india soon after their nations independence'
p7996
aS'since then our political engagement has deepened'
p7997
aS'our defence and security cooperation is growing'
p7998
aS'trade is expanding but it is still modest'
p7999
aS'our cooperation in energy sector has begun'
p8000
aS'later today we will launch the drilling of the first oil well with indian investments in kazakhstan'
p8001
aS'indian investments in central asia have started flowing in'
p8002
aS'and so have indian tourists in growing numbers'
p8003
aS'more than 50 flights a week connect the five central asian capitals to india'
p8004
aS'and it takes about the same time as it would take to fly to chennai from delhi'
p8005
aS'our strongest progress is in human resource development'
p8006
aS'thousands of professionals and students from central asia have trained in india'
p8007
aS'many from india come to the universities in the region'
p8008
aS'we have established centres of excellence in information and communication technology in the region'
p8009
aS'and we are also pleased that we have three indian cultural centres in the region'
p8010
aS'yet we will be the first to say that the engagement between india and central asia falls short of its promise and potential'
p8011
aS'we have a special place in our hearts for each other'
p8012
aS'but we have not paid as much attention to each other as we should'
p8013
aS'this will change'
p8014
aS'that is why i am travelling to all five countries in the region in the early stages of my government'
p8015
aS'both india and central asia can not achieve their full potential without each other'
p8016
aS'nor will our people be safer and our region more stable without our cooperation'
p8017
aS'india constitutes one-sixth of humanity'
p8018
aS'it is a nation of 800 million youth that is an enormous force of progress and change for india and the world'
p8019

p8020
aS'5 every year'
p8021

aS'india is the new frontier of opportunities for the world'
p8023

p8024
aS'so i am here to start a new era in our relationship with central asia'
p8025
aS'india is prepared to invest more in a new partnership of prosperity'
p8026
aS'we will work together not just in minerals and energy but in industries such as pharmaceuticals textiles engineering and small and medium enterprises'
p8027
aS'we can invest in refineries petrochemicals and fertilizer plants here'
p8028

p8030
aS'we can use the reach of space technology for closer partnership in development and resource management'
p8031
aS'i also see vast opportunities in areas like agriculture and dairy'
p8032
aS'we can renew our old ties in traditional medicines'
p8033
aS'central asia is a natural destination for the indian tourists'
p8034
aS'we are intensifying our exchanges in culture education and research'
p8035
aS'and we will connect our youth more'
p8036
aS'in this troubled world we must also strengthen our defence and security cooperation to defend our values our nations security and our regions peace'
p8037
aS'we live at the frontier of instability'
p8038
aS'we live close to the crucible of extremism and terrorism'
p8039
aS'we see terrorism spawned by nations and groups'
p8040
aS'today we also see cyber space become a platform without borders for terror to draw recruits to its cause'
p8041
aS'from theatres of conflicts to the calm neighbourhoods of distant cities terrorism has become a global challenge as never before'
p8042
aS'it is a force that is larger and more enduring than its changing names locations and targets'
p8043
aS'so we must ask ourselves will we let a generation of youth be lost to guns and hate because they will hold us accountable for their lost future'
p8044
aS'so during this visit we will strengthen our defence and security cooperation in the region'
p8045
aS'but we will also combat terrorism by the strength of our values and our commitment to humanism'
p8046
aS'this is a responsibility that india and central asian nations owe to our shared inheritance and to the future of our region'
p8047
aS'our shared values and aspirations are also the foundation of closer international partnership including in the united nations'
p8048
aS'but in a transformed world we also see the growing institutional erosion of the united nations'
p8049
aS'as nations that are committed to international order we must work to make it relevant to our times'
p8050
aS'so as the united nations turns 70 we should press for reforms of the united nations especially its security council'
p8051
aS'indias membership of shanghai cooperation organisation will deepen our regional partnership'
p8052
aS'and we have begun a study on a free trade agreement with the eurasian economic union for deeper integration with this region'
p8053
aS'this is an era in which space and cyber are making roads and rails less relevant'
p8054
aS'but we will also restore our physical connectivity for trade transit and energy'
p8055
aS'the international north south transport corridor opens a competitive and quick route for india to eurasia'
p8056
aS'and i hope all of central asia will join it'
p8057
aS'we hope to join the ashgabat agreement on trade and transit'
p8058
aS'indias investment in chahbahar port in iran will bring us closer to central asia'
p8059
aS'i also hope that we can restore the traditional route to central asia through pakistan and afghanistan'
p8060
aS'we can draw confidence from the agreement between turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan and india on the gas pipeline'
p8061
aS'this region has prospered the most when we have been connected'
p8062
aS'indeed our hopes of an asian century will be realized when we see asia as one - not as south west east or central'
p8063
aS'asia will rise when we all prosper together'
p8064
aS'for that we must connect asias different parts'
p8065
aS'india is at the crossroads of asias land and sea routes'
p8066
aS'we understand our responsibility'
p8067
aS'and we are working with a sense of priority to connect ourselves to the east and the west by land and sea'
p8068
aS'there is a surge of interest in reconnecting asia with itself and beyond'
p8069
aS'our former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee ji called for a new silk route initiative here in 2002'
p8070
aS'today all of asia seeks the revival of the glorious ancient silk road'
p8071
aS'but we must also remember the lessons of history'
p8072
aS'the silk road flourished and waned with the fortunes of central asia'
p8073
aS'the end of the silk road did not just come about from the rise of sea-based trade of the new european powers'
p8074
aS'it also happened because central asia was no longer a bridge between regions but the new fault line between great empires to the east west and south when it was no longer the hub of trade but a land in the shadows of the high walls of the powers around it'
p8075
aS'central asian nations declined and trade withered'
p8076
aS'the success of connectivity through and across central asia is important'
p8077
aS'for that the great nations of central asia must flourish and regain their central role in eurasia'
p8078
aS'from europe to asia all nations must foster a climate of cooperation and collaboration not competition and exclusion in this region'
p8079
aS'the region must remain stable and peaceful free from conflict and the violence of extremism and terrorism'
p8080
aS'and as central asia links the east and the west it must also connect to the south'
p8081
aS'for that is how it always was'
p8082
aS'in an age of globalization asia can not remain fragmented'
p8083
aS'and central asia can not remain distant and disconnected from india'
p8084
aS'i am confident that we can make it happen'
p8085
aS'our ancestors crossed the mighty himalaya karakoram hindu kush and pamirs for spiritualism knowledge and markets'
p8086
aS'we will all work together to build the silk route of the 21st century'
p8087
aS'we will connect through space and cyber as we will by air land and sea'
p8088
aS'let me conclude with a few lines from abduraheim otkur a poet of this region'
p8089
aS'he said our tracks remain our dreams remain everything remains far away yet even if the wind blows or the sand shift they will never be covered our tracks and the caravan will never stop along the way though our horses are very thin one way or another these tracks will be found someday by our grandchildren or our great grandchildren'
p8090
aS'i say this to you india and central asia will redeem that promise'

aS'this year the rains have started on a good note'
p8235
aS'this will definitely prove beneficial to our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing of kharif crops'
p8236
aS'i am very pleased to share an immensely good news with you all'
p8237
aS'we have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country'
p8238
aS'poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food'

aS'the good news for me is that there has been an increase of approximately 50 in the production of pulses and anincrease of around 33 in the production of oilseeds'
p8240
aS'i would especially like to congratulate and compliment all my farmer brothers and sisters for this achievement'
p8241
aS'my dear countrymen 26th july is marked as kargil vijay diwas in the history of our country'
p8242
aS'the intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree'
p8243
aS'during the kargil war each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies'
p8244
aS'i would like to salute all our brave soldiers who thwarted the attempts by our enemies without caring for their lives'
p8245
aS'kargil war was not limited to justour borders but each of our cities villages contributed in this war'
p8246
aS'this war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border'
p8247
aS'this war was also fought by the daughters of our country who were newly married and their henna were still fresh on their hands'
p8248
aS'also by the proud fathers who saw themselves as soldiers seeing their sons fighting for the country and also by that infant who had not even learnt to walkcatching his fathers fingers'
p8249
aS'it is because of these unmatchable sacrifices that our country is proudly standing on its feet in front of the entire world'
p8250
aS'hence i would like to salute all these valiant warriors on this occasion of kargil vijay diwas'
p8251
aS'there is another reason why i consider 26th july quite important because mygov'
p8252
aS'in was launched a few months after our government was formed'
p8253
aS'our pledge was to promote citizen participation in democracy and connect every citizen in the development work'
p8254
aS'and today i am pleased to share this after one year that nearly two crore people have visited mygov website'
p8255
aS'we have received comments from five and a half lac people and i am extremely glad to mention that more than fiftythousand people took out time from their precious schedule to apply their mind and provide their suggestions on pmo applications as they considered this work important'
p8256
aS'and we have received quite significant suggestions'
p8257
aS'one of the suggestions sent from mr akhilesh vajpayee from kanpur is to provide separate quota to the disabled for booking tickets on irctc website'
p8258
aS'it is quite unfair that the disabled citizens have to go through the same tiring procedure and buy tickets atthe railway station'
p8259
aS'though this is a very minor issue but the government never took note of it or thought about the same previously'
p8260
aS'but on the suggestion of our brother akhilesh vajpayee our government looked into this suggestion seriously and we have implemented this facility in our system for our disabled brothers and sisters'
p8261
aS'we are receiving quite positive suggestions on mygov it is helping in getting assistance in creating logos tag-lines and formulating policies byyourselves'
p8262
aS'we are experiencing fresh air in the administrative system'
p8263
aS'we are experiencing a new sense of consciousness'
p8264
aS'i am even receiving suggestion on mygov that what should be my speech on 15th of august'
p8265
aS'we have received quite a few suggestions from suchitra raghavachari from chennai in this regard'
p8266
aS'she has suggested me to speak on the topics like save our daughters educate a girl child clean ganges swachh bharat'
p8267
aS'with this i got an idea and i am requesting you all to send suggestions about what should be the topics for my 15th august speech'
p8268
aS'you can send in your suggestions through mygov letters to radio or write letters to the pms office'
p8269
aS'look i believe that this will be a greatinitiative to include peoples suggestion in framing my speech for 15th august'
p8270
aS'i believe that you will send your good suggestions'
p8271
aS'i would like to talk about an issue which is a matter of great concern'
p8272
aS'i neither want to sermonize nor i am trying to find an escape route towards my responsibilities pertaining to state government central government or units of local self-government institutions'
p8273
aS'two days ago a visual of an accident in delhi caught my attention wherein the victim on scooter was fighting for his life for ten minutes post the accident'
p8274
aS'he did not receive any help from the passers-by'
p8275
aS'in general also i have noticed that i have been receiving suggestions to speak on road safety and make the people aware of this'
p8276
aS'be it hoshakote akshay from bengaluru ameya joshi from pune or prasanna kakunje from mudbidri karnataka all these all people have writtento me there are many other names which i am not being able to mention and have raised their concerns'
p8277
aS'i agree that whatever you have put forth is valid'
p8278
aS'my heart shivers when i look at the statistics of accidents'
p8279
aS'we are witnessing an accident every minute in our country'
p8280
aS'due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country'
p8281
aS'it is a matter of huge concern that out of these deaths nearly one third of the victims comprise the youth ranging from 15 to 25 years of age group and such death shakes the very foundation of an entire family'
p8282
aS'the government system will continue to work towards this but iwould like to request all the parents to make their children aware of all the safety rules pertaining to driving a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler the families should encourage discussion of road safety at home and create an atmosphere about the same to promote road safety'
p8283
aS'we have seen few lines written at the back of auto-rickshaws papa come home early and after reading it we are so touched by it'
p8284
aS'and therefore i say that the government has taken a lot of new initiativesin this regard be it the initiative of education on road safety initiative related to road engineering or of enforcement of road safety laws and the discussion on emergency care to be provided post accidents'
p8285
aS'we are going to implement road transport and safety bill to adopt these safety measures in our country'
p8286
aS'in the coming days we are also planning to take many important measures for implementing national road safety policy and road safety action plan'
p8287
aS'we have undertaken another project called cashless treatment in gurgaon jaipur and vadodara to mumbai ranchi rangaon and mundiya national highway and it will be further extended'
p8288
aS'the cashless treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post-accident one need worry if one has money or not who will pay the bills leaving all this worry one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospitalfacilities at the earliest'
p8289
aS'we have started a toll-free number 1033 for providing information about incidents across the country and ambulance service but all these are services are for post accidents'
p8290
aS'one must strive to avoid accidents first but it is also important for us to see from the perspective that each and every soul each and every life is precious'
p8291
aS'sometimes i say that the government employees to be karma yogis or selfless workers'
p8292
aS'i recalled a few incidents in the last few days which i liked and hence would like to share with you'
p8293
aS'sometimes people get tired of their continuous jobs'
p8294
aS'in the initial few years the attitude is okay i get my salary so i will work'
p8295
aS'however i came across an incident of a railway department a few days ago wherein a railway tte vijay biswal from nagpur division who is gifted with painting prowesscould have has chosen to showcase his skills related to any field but he continues to work with the railways and paints various scenes related to railways only'
p8296
aS'through this he gets an inner satisfaction for his job and also enjoys his hobby at the same time'
p8297
aS'using his example we can learn how to bring more life to our own jobs'
p8298
aS'vijay biswal has shown us how we can connect our jobs with our hobbies interests or skills'
p8299
aS'who knows vijay biswals work may get recognised by hispaintings across the nation in the near future'
p8300
aS'i have come to know about a very inspiring work started by the entire team of government officials in harda district madhya pradesh'
p8301
aS'these bunch of officials with their entire team have started such a work which has touched me immensely and i really liked it and the work they have started is operation malyuddh and upon hearing this you will feel that this subject will go in a certain direction'
p8302
aS'but the key focus of this operation is to give a new direction to swachh bharatabhiyaan'
p8303
aS'they are working on brother number one operation in which the best brother has to gift one toilet to his sister'
p8304
aS'on the occasion of raksha bandhan they are influencing all the brothers to gift toilet to their sisters so that all the mothers and sisters of the district avoid going to toilet in the open'
p8305
aS'this operation has given a new meaning to raksha bandhan and i would like to congratulate the entire government team of harda district for this initiative'
p8306
aS'i came across a news a few days back and these small news really gives me immense pleasure and i would like to share the same with you'
p8307
aS'there exists a small village called keshla in rajnandgaon chhattisgarh'
p8308

p8310
aS'after the completion of this campaign the entire village celebrated this accomplishment just like amega festival'

p8317
aS'after our government was formed thedoner department took an important decision of not staying in delhi and working from centre for the north-east regions'
p8318
aS'instead it was decided to send the government officials and their team on a seven days camp to north-east states like nagaland arunachal pradesh tripura assam and sikkim'
p8319
aS'these officials would visit the districts villages and meet the local government officials and talk to peoples representatives and the citizens of those regions'
p8320

p8321
aS'this initiative will bring a fruitful result in the near future'
p8322
aS'the officials who will visit these states would realize the beauty of these states and will feel very determined to work for the development of these states and to fix the problems of these states'
p8323

p8327
aS'such news remain in the flashlight for few moments and are gone'
p8328
aS'we often do not remember these achievements for a long time'
p8329
aS'i am often worried by this thought that we speak to the youth of our nation and ask about their dream job only one out of 100 would express theirinterest in becoming a scientist'
p8330
aS'youth is losing their interest in science which is a matter of great concern'
p8331

p8332
aS'the youth of our country should dream about becoming a scientist and imbibe interests in the field of research and innovation'

aS'i have travelled to nagaland on many occasions'
p8374
aS'i have been deeply impressed by the rich and diverse culture and the unique way of life of the naga people'
p8375
aS'it makes not only our nation but also the world a more beautiful place'
p8376
aS'the naga courage and commitment are legendary'
p8377
aS'equally they represent the highest levels of humanism'
p8378
aS'their system of village administration and grass-root democracy should be an inspiration for the rest of the country'
p8379
aS'the respect for the infirm and elders the status of women in society sensitivity to mother nature and the emphasis on social equality is a natural way of naga life'
p8380
aS'these are values that should constitute the foundation of the society that we all seek'
p8381
aS'unfortunately the naga problem has taken so long to resolve because we did not understand each other'
p8382
aS'it is a legacy of the british rule'
p8383
aS'the colonial rulers had by design kept the nagas isolated and insulated'
p8384
aS'they propagated terrible myths about nagas in the rest of the country'
p8385
aS'they deliberately suppressed the reality that the nagas were an extremely evolved society'
p8386
aS'they also spread negative ideas about the rest of india amongst naga people'
p8387
aS'this was part of the well known policyof divide and rule of the colonial rulers'
p8388
aS'it is one of the tragedies of independent india that we have lived with this legacy'
p8389
aS'there were not many like mahatma gandhi who loved the naga people and was sensitive to their sentiments'
p8390
aS'we have continued to look at each other through the prism of false perceptions and old prejudices'
p8391
aS'the result was that connectivity between nagaland and the rest of india remained weak across this divide'
p8392
aS'economic development and progress in nagaland remained modest and durable peace was elusive'
p8393
aS'since becoming prime minister last year peace security and economic transformation of north east has been amongst my highest priorities'
p8394
aS'it is also at the heart of my foreign policy especially the act east policy'
p8395
aS'i have been deeply concerned about resolving the naga issue'
p8396
aS'soon after entering office i appointed an interlocutor for talks with the naga leaders who not only understood the naga people as also their aspirations and expectations but has great affection and respect for them'
p8397
aS'given the importance of this initiative i asked my office to supervise these talks and i personally kept in touch with the progress'
p8398
aS'i want to especially thank my senior colleague home minister shri rajnath singhji whose support and advice was invaluable in bringing us here today'
p8399
aS'todays agreement is a shining example of what we can achieve when we deal with each other in a spirit of equality and respect trust and confidence when we seek to understand concerns and try to address aspirations when we leave the path of dispute and take the high road of dialogue'
p8400
aS'it is a lesson and an inspiration in our troubled world'
p8401
aS'today we mark not merely the end of a problem but the beginning of a new future'
p8402
aS'we will not only try to heal wounds and resolve problems but also be your partner as you restore your pride and prestige'
p8403

p8405
aS'equally the rest of the nation will join you in shaping a future of dignity opportunity and prosperity for the naga people'

p8456
aS'this dawn is also the dawn of the dreams of the one hundred twenty five crore indian citizens'
p8457
aS'this dawn also heralds the resolve of 125 crore people of india'
p8458
aS'on this pious occasion i also extend my many many salutations to all those greatpersons of india who sacrificed their lives and led a life of penance while making persistent efforts to fight for the honour of the country'

p8462
aS'the vastness and the diversity of india is always talked about but our india has many other great characteristics as well there is a lot of diversity in india'
p8463
aS'india is a large country'
p8464
aS'and there is simplicity among the people of india'
p8465
aS'there is unity running through all the parts of the country and that is what is our strength the strength of our nation'
p8466
aS'strength of our country has been sustained over centuries together'
p8467
aS'every era has seen the attempts to boost it further'
p8468
aS'theyhave been moulded according to the requirements of realising the dreams for the future they have been nurtured and it is due to that only that this country has reached this far with our age old traditions and ever new resolves'
p8469
aS'our unity simplicity fraternity harmony are our biggest strength'
p8470
aS'this strength should never be blemished it should never be hit'
p8471
aS'if the unity of the country gets disturbed the dreams also get shattered therefore whether it is the poison of casteism communal fanaticism we dont have to allow it in any form whatsoever not allow it to take root and then we have to cure the poison of casteism the fanaticism of communalism with the nectar of development distribute the flow of the nectar of development and through the flow of this nectar attempt bringing about a new awareness'
p8472
aS'dear brothers and sisters this country is moving ahead because of the team india and this team india is a big team of our one twenty five crore countrymen'
p8473
aS'the world might never have thought about the team of one twenty five crore citizens working as a team together as to how they take the nation to new heights build the nation and also protect it'
p8474
aS'so whatever we are doing and wherever we are trying to reach it is all because of the team india and we are grateful to this team india'
p8475
aS'peoples participation is the biggest strength of democracy'
p8476
aS'if we run the country through the participation of one hundred and twenty five crore indians our country will be moving ahead one hundred and twenty five crore steps every moment'
p8477
aS'that is why we have encouraged this peoples participation as team india'
p8478
aS'we have given priority to team india'
p8479
aS'through electronic platform mygov'
p8480
aS'in through lacs of letters of the countrymen through my mann ki baat throughdialogues with citizens this peoples participation is on the rise day by day'
p8481
aS'about every affair of the government we receive a number of suggestions from the far flung villages of our country and this is the real strength of our team india'
p8482
aS'my dear fellow citizens this is a fact that there is only one mandate of this team india and that is all our schemes all our systems should benefit the poor of the country'
p8483
aS'we should support the poor in their fight against poverty and empower them in this arduous effort of theirs because no one wants to remain poor and they also wish to get rid of poverty'
p8484
aS'hence the meaningfulness of our resources our schemes and our programmes is in their usefulness to the cause ofwelfare of the poor'
p8485
aS'brothers and sisters last year on the occasion of 15th of august i had expressed some of my views before you'
p8486
aS'at that time i was new whatever i saw in the government i expressed them with an open mind before one hundred and twenty five crore citizens'
p8487
aS'today after one year standing under the tricolor from the same ramparts of the red fort i assure the countrymen that in this period of one year our team india consisting of one hundred and twenty five crore people iscommitted to realize our dreams within the timeframe with new hope new energy and utmost hard work'
p8488
aS'an atmosphere of trust has emerged'
p8489
aS'i had announced pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna on the last 15th of august'
p8490
aS'even after sixty years of independence even when the banks were nationalized for the poor 40 people of the country were without a bank account till the last 15th of august the doors of the banks were not open for the poor'
p8491
aS'we resolved that we would erase this blot andwould provide a solid base to the financial inclusion which is talked about the world over by integrating the poorest of the poor to the mainstream economic activities and this is only the beginning'
p8492
aS'we had decided that unlike the previous work culture of talking in terms of uncertain time frames we will complete the work by the 26th of january as the country celebrates the next republic day'
p8493
aS'my countrymen today i can proudly say that we achieved that target within the time frame'
p8494
aS'17 crore people opened their bank accounts under pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna'
p8495
aS'with a view to extend opportunities to the poor we had said that these bank accounts could be opened with zero balance'
p8496
aS'we had even said that we would bear the operational costs of the bank'
p8497
aS'after all what for the banks exist'
p8498
aS'they should be for the poor and thats why we had decided to open accounts with zerobalance'
p8499
aS'we have seen the rich of our country however this time around we have also seen our poor and seen their wealth'
p8500
aS'from the ramparts of the red fort let me salute and bow to the large-heartedness of these poor because even if there was a provision of opening the account with zero balance these poor people have deposited twenty thousand crore rupees in their bank accounts'
p8501
aS'it could be possible only due to richness of our poor citizens'
p8502
aS'and hence today my conviction bearsproof that it is all because of the spirit of these poor that this team india will march ahead'
p8503
aS'brothers and sisters if the branch of a bank is opened or a building of the bank is constructed in a certain part of our country it becomes the hot topic of discussion people rejoice it is hailed as a mark of great development and remarkable progress'
p8504
aS'this is so because in the past 60 years we have measured the development of the country only on the basis of these parameters'
p8505
aS'this has been the yardstick that if any branch of a bank is opened somewhere it elicits lotsof accolades and praises the government receives much adulation but my dear fellow citizens it is not a challenging task to open a branch of a bank'
p8506
aS'this task can easily be accomplished through the government exchequer but to bring 17 crore countrymen to the doorstep of the bank is an arduous task it takes a lot of hard work you have to give your heart and soul to accomplish this task you are required to be ever vigilant'
p8507
aS'and here i would extend my heartfeltcongratulations to various banks and their employees who have been a very significant part of team india'
p8508
aS'i congratulate them for making banks so easily accessible to the poor and this fact will bring a major change in the coming days'
p8509
aS'among the global economic schools of thought there is also the one which maintains that financial inclusion doesnt always bring positive results and due to that the system has to bear the pressure of poverty'
p8510
aS'i disagree with this thought'
p8511
aS'in a country like india if we look at the pyramid of development its base is the broadest'
p8512
aS'if it be firm the entire pyramid of development tends to be strong'
p8513
aS'today the downtrodden the exploited oppressed deprived and the ignored ones ofour country form the base of the pyramid of development'
p8514
aS'we have to strengthen the foundation of this pyramid of development so as to ensure that these people are empowered through financial inclusion and this pyramid of development remains unshakable'
p8515
aS'it would stand firm amid any crisis and if this pyramid of development is based on economic strength it would increase the purchasing power of these people to a great extent'
p8516
aS'and when the purchasing power of the poorest ofthe poor in the society increases nobody can stop that economy to flourish and move ahead'
p8517
aS'it takes the country swiftly to the newer heights of development and therefore it is our intention to give impetus to that'
p8518
aS'we have laid great stress upon social security and also the welfare of the poor - and thus prime ministers suraksha bima yojana atal pension yojana and prime ministers jeevan jyoti bima yojana have been launched'
p8519
aS'crores of the people of our country have nosocial security cover'
p8520
aS'leave the poor aside benefit of insurance has not reached even the lower middle class'
p8521
aS'so we made a plan - just pay one rupee per month not more that is just rs'
p8522
aS'12 per annum and be entitled to the benefits of pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojana'
p8523
aS'if your family faces any calamity then they will receive 2 lac rupees'
p8524
aS'we know how to manage an economy'
p8525
aS'thats why we launched prime ministers jeevan jyoti bima yojana for 90 paisa a day even less than 1 rupee'
p8526
aS'so itis rs'
p8527
aS'330 annually for the health of ones family - and for the security of ones family- insurance of 2 lac rupees'
p8528
aS'this is what we have done'
p8529
aS'brothers and sisters schemes have been made in the past also'
p8530
aS'there is no government which doesnt make schemes'
p8531
aS'every government does that'
p8532
aS'there is no government which doesnt make announcements'
p8533
aS'every government does that'
p8534
aS'there is no government which doesnt light the inauguration lamps doesnt cut ribbons -- every government does that'
p8535
aS'but the touchstone is whether we walk the talk or not'
p8536
aS'we have laid a great stress upon a new work culture'
p8537
aS'dear countrymen our nation has manyschemes which are 40 years old or 50years old but these schemes could not reach more than 5 or 7 crore people'
p8538
aS'this scheme has just completed a hundred days 100 days'
p8539
aS'i mean it and in these hundred days ten crore citizens have been benefited 10 crore people'
p8540
aS'ten crore citizens of this country means ten crore families'
p8541
aS'and this means that out of total 30-35 crore families of our country ten crore families have joined this scheme within a span of hundred days'
p8542
aS'brothers and sisters the uniqueness of our government of team india during last one year especially the great strength and the biggest achievement of team india consisting of one hundred and twenty five crore people has been to fulfill the tasks within the set time frame'
p8543
aS'last year i referred to toilet facilities for all from this red fort i also referred to cleanliness'
p8544
aS'it sounded strange to the whole country for a few hours as to what sort of prime minister is this'
p8545
aS'but today in all the surveys that has been carried out in the entire country this point has come out in all of them that if there is something that is the most important factor of team india and that has touched every person is the movement towards cleanliness'
p8546
aS'brothers and sisters we used to invoke the people of the society and marked the names of various people to promote the cleanliness drive'
p8547
aS'that was such a period but today i have to congratulate this team india'
p8548
aS'people from all walks of life whether they are celebrities diplomats social workers educationists community leaders or spiritual leaders or our friends from media all of them have taken a major responsibility to train the common man without criticisinganybody and without pointing towards the lacunas'
p8549
aS'today i greet them all from the core of my heart who have done this job but i only wish to stress upon a point- from whom this swachh bharat drive has gained maximum strength'
p8550
aS'who are its biggest brand ambassador'
p8551
aS'you may not have paid heed to it but try to remember what happened in your family'
p8552
aS'there are crores of such families in india whose children are in the age group of five ten and fifteen and they have become the greatestambassador of swachh bharat abhiyaan'
p8553
aS'these children prevent their parents from littering in their homes and ask them to avoid spreading filth and rubbish here and there'
p8554
aS'in case any father is addicted to consuming gutka and whenever the father opens the windows of the car to spit his son prevents him to do so on the plea of keeping india clean'
p8555
aS'the success of this programme is due to those little children'
p8556
aS'i wish to bow my head towards the future of my country i wish to bow myhead and greet those children'
p8557
aS'the fact which is not realized even by the elite people has been easily understood by the innocent children and it is my belief that such a country where a child is so much aware so committed towards cleanliness such country is bound to become clean abhorrence against filth and dirt is bound to arise there'
p8558
aS'in 2019 we are about to celebrate the 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi and on 150th anniversary of gandhiji we have to handover him swachh bharat as a tribute'
p8559
aS'there can not be a greater tribute to mahatma gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary'
p8560
aS'the task has just started but i have to take it forward not to stop it not get to satisfied'
p8561
aS'i had announced such a programme from here just for a trial so that i could ascertain whether team india is able to do it ornot'
p8562
aS'i had announced it without consulting anybody'
p8563
aS'it was not announced after collecting relevant information from districts and villages'
p8564
aS'it just came into my heart and i had announced that we would build separate toilets for boys and girls in all of our schools till the next 15th august'
p8565
aS'but later on when we started work the team india figured out its responsibilities we realised that there were 2 lakh and 62 thousand such schools where more than 4'
p8566
aS'25 lakh toilets wererequired to be built'
p8567
aS'this figure was so big that any government could rethink to extend the deadline but it certainly was the resolve of the team india that no one sought any extension'
p8568
aS'today on this 15th august i salute the team india who keeping the honour of our tricolour national flag left no stone unturned to realise that dream and the team india has now nearly achieved the target of building all the toilets'
p8569
aS'i compliment to all the state governments governmentofficers of the districts policy framers and implementers of educational institutions who were involved in realising this achievement'
p8570
aS'this is not just an issue of building more than 4'
p8571
aS'25 lakh toilets'
p8572
aS'this is an issue of creating an atmosphere of self-confidence at a time when we were so engulfed with the negativity that it was being told that nothing could happen there was no hope it was not possible'
p8573
aS'but now the team india has demonstrated that we are ready to acceptchallenges we would not withdraw and we are committed for our success'
p8574
aS'the nation runs on this self-confidence the nation runs by realising newer resolutions'
p8575
aS'we can not stop anywhere we have to continuously move forward'
p8576
aS'therefore brothers and sisters we have prepared a plan for the labourers of our country and it has been named as shrameva jayate'
p8577
aS'our attitude towards the poor labourers is not good'
p8578
aS'if we meet a person wearing coat pants tie or we meet a great person wearing long kurta jacket we salute him by standing in his honour'
p8579
aS'but if an auto rickshaw driver pedal rickshaw puller newspaper vendor or a milkman come to us our feelings towards these poor men are not proper'
p8580
aS'one hundred and twenty five crore citizens of the country have to remove this deficiency of the nation by their resolution of mind'
p8581
aS'the persons due to whom we look good who serve us good no one isour better well wisher than them and therefor dignity of labourers honour of labourers pride of labourers- this should be our national duty this should be our national character this should be the tendency of everyone nature of everyone'
p8582
aS'recently we started a campaign of issuing special identity card to the unorganized labour falling under certain schemes'
p8583
aS'they are to get the benefits of many schemes of security through that identity card'
p8584
aS'these unorganized labourerswere never taken care of'
p8585
aS'similarly labourers of our country had deposited their share of hard earned money in government coffers'
p8586
aS'slowly this amount grew to rs'
p8587
aS'27 thousand crores but when that poor labourer moves to some another place after 6-8 months of employment there moves to another place after a year or two from there no account of the money he deposited there is maintained'
p8588
aS'the amount is also so low that he does not wish to bring back the same by spending two hundredrupees on fare'
p8589
aS'that is why rs'
p8590
aS'27 thousand crores of poor people of my country labourers of my country money earned by them by the sweat of their brow was lying idle in the coffers of the government'
p8591
aS'we found a solution to it'
p8592
aS'we provided a special identity card number to these labourers and told them wherever you are transferred now even if you move to another place by quitting the job or if you move from one factory to another from one state to another you will always retainthis number and you will retain your money no one will be able to misappropriate your single rupee'
p8593
aS'so we have tried to return the rs'
p8594
aS'27 thousand crores to the poor'
p8595
aS'it has become a fashion in our country- make law for everything and keep our courts busy'
p8596
aS'one law may contradict the other but the law should be on the same subject'
p8597
aS'confusion was being created here always'
p8598
aS'this is not a good sign for good governance and therefor law should be explicit law should be correct law should not be out of sync with time only then society progresses'
p8599
aS'where will a poor labourer look for his thing of interest in the pile-up of different types of 44 legislations meant for our labourers'
p8600
aS'we have brought about a change therein'
p8601
aS'by incorporating these 44 legislations into four codes of conduct the poorest of the poor and even an illiterate labourer can know about his or her interest we have emphasized this scheme'
p8602
aS'brothers and sisters corruption is a much discussed topic in our country'
p8603
aS'we must have seen an ailing person habitually giving tips to others on how to be healthy'
p8604
aS'he does not care for himself but it is the nature of every human being to advise others that you do it and you will become healthy and you do that and you will become healthy'
p8605
aS'corruption is also like this'
p8606
aS'the person involved in it also advise the person who is suffering due to it also advise and thus they advise eachother and this goes on and on'
p8607
aS'brothers and sisters i have never made this announcement but today i wish to state i want to assure my fellow countrymen i want to tell the team india comprising 1'
p8608
aS'25 billion people that this country can become corruption-free'
p8609
aS'on the basis of experience i am saying this'
p8610
aS'this job has to be started from the top'
p8611
aS'corruption is stuck with our country like a termite and the termite keeps on spreading initially it is not visible but when it spreads in our bedroom and reaches thecupboard where clothes are hung we find that and when we want to get rid of it insecticides have to be injected per square meter of land'
p8612
aS'after so many of years of efforts we get rid of termite'
p8613
aS'countless efforts of several types have to be made to wipe out the corruption in such a vast country and that can be done'
p8614
aS'if i had said that i would cut subsidy worth rs'
p8615
aS'15 thousand cores on lpg gas then i can say that hundreds of articles would have been written to glorifymy government'
p8616
aS'they can say that this man has the power and strength to discontinue the subsidy worth rs'
p8617
aS'15 thousand cores on lpg gas'
p8618
aS'it is this man who can take tough decision and if it is not done so then nothing happens my dear friends and nothing is visible'
p8619
aS'sometimes people are fond of sinking into despair'
p8620
aS'until they talk of despair amongst people they can not sleep at night'
p8621
aS'they have this habit'
p8622
aS'there are some ailing people who do not like to disclose about their illness and they also do not like to someone inquiring about their ailment'
p8623
aS'while there are some others who wait for a particular person to enquire about their health and if he does not visit they talk about this for hours together'
p8624
aS'i can see that there are some people who always search for negativism propagate negativism and they enjoy it as much as they can'
p8625
aS'such people neither have anyschemes nor activities yet team india consisting of 1'
p8626
aS'25 billion indians is ready to invest time for them but how does that happen'
p8627
aS'we have put in place a scheme of direct benefit transfer of lpg subsidy'
p8628
aS'taking advantage of jan dhan accounts and adhaar card we have transferred the subsidy directly into the accounts'
p8629
aS'as a result of this the brokers the middlemen and the blackmarketeers have disappeared'
p8630
aS'only the real beneficiary got the benefit'
p8631
aS'our government haveneither slashed a penny from anyones benefit nor we have made announcements to earn praise'
p8632
aS'we have improved the system and today i wish to inform the team india of 1'
p8633
aS'25 billion indians that as a result of this an amount of rs'
p8634
aS'15 crore which was being siphoned off annually in the name of gas cylinders has been stopped'
p8635
aS'my countrymen the corruption has stopped'
p8636
aS'my brothers and sisters you can see how work is done'
p8637
aS'we have done it'
p8638
aS'rupees 15000 crore is not a small amount for a country like india'
p8639
aS'we have launched an open website displayed a board of delivery there even then if someone has a complaint he would get a cylinder even at midnight but we can not permit those who loot the country and poors as well'
p8640
aS'tell me whether this is not a fight against corruption'
p8641
aS'my brothers and sisters i had made a request to my countrymen that if you are economically sound then why do you avail subsidy on l'
p8642
aS'p'
p8643
aS'g'
p8644
aS'why do you need this paltry amount of rupees five to seven hundred which you usually spend on petty snacks'
p8645
aS'i had just started giving message about this i didnt launch any campaign as yet because i have faith in team india'
p8646
aS'as the message spreads the result would come but to-day i can tell with pride that ever-since i had launched movementof give it up subsidy of lpg gas cylinder till date 20 lakh consumers have already given it up'
p8647
aS'this is not a small figure'
p8648
aS'even if we are in the queue before a temple for the blessings prasaad we sometimes wish that we should get some of the prasad for our younger brother also'
p8649
aS'this is in our nature'
p8650
aS'these 20 lakh people are not from rich or wealthy families'
p8651
aS'they are all from the common middle class'
p8652
aS'some teacher may have been a pensioner but when he learnt that this lpg cylinder may go to some poor person he gave up his subsidy'
p8653
aS'my dear brothers and sisters when these 20lakh lpg cylinders will reach the poor families whose kitchens are smoke choked just think of the happiness of the mothers working in those kitchens'
p8654
aS'just think of the relief and happiness of the little children who had been crying due to the smoke'
p8655
aS'whenever our efforts are in the right direction we get great results'
p8656
aS'my brothers and sisters if i talk about coal some of the political pundits or experts will judge me on a political angle'
p8657
aS'this is not a place for politicking so i would like to urge upon all the political pundits that in this case the kind of coal issue that i am going to raise may please not be judged through the political angle'
p8658
aS'this is the requirement of our nations resolve'
p8659
aS'cag said that when coal blocks were allocated through lottery the nation lost rs'
p8660
aS'1 lakh and 74 thousandcrores'
p8661
aS'we also used this statistics in the election-speeches'
p8662
aS'nevertheless we sometimes thought that this much of loss may not have been there'
p8663
aS'but we went on saying like that'
p8664
aS'later we decided that whether it be coal or spectrum or any other mineral all will be auctioned henceforth'
p8665
aS'lo and behold'
p8666
aS'the great strength of the team india of 125 crore indians and their resolve'
p8667
aS'within a certain time limit the coal was auctioned and now almost rs'
p8668
aS'3 lakh crore would beaccruing to the national exchequer'
p8669
aS'brothers and sisters just ask yourselves whether corruption was rooted out or not'
p8670
aS'whether the middlemen were ousted or not'
p8671
aS'whether the door was shut on the face of the wealth-stealers of india or not'
p8672
aS'i did not make any speech in this regard'
p8673
aS'i just did it'
p8674
aS'the same thing happened in the case of spectrum'
p8675
aS'right now fm radio auction is going on'
p8676
aS'a lot of pressure was put on me'
p8677
aS'people said modi ji fm is operated by the common men there in no great profit in this business'
p8678
aS'whyare you putting even fm on auction'
p8679
aS'a lot of pressure was put on me'
p8680
aS'all attempts were made to dissuade me from this'
p8681
aS'but i said that the team india consisting of 125 crore of indians wanted transparency'
p8682
aS'right now the auction is on for fm radio in some 80-85 cities'
p8683
aS'the day before when i enquired the auction amount had crossed rs'
p8684
aS'one thousand crores'
p8685
aS'this money is going to be used for the poor people'
p8686
aS'brothers and sisters what a run the country had at the hands of its leadership how it was looted what impact was put on the policies'
p8687
aS'what kind of an activity it was that continued in the country'
p8688
aS'imported coal from the foreign countries was not given to the power plants near the coasts'
p8689
aS'it was transported to the factories of nearby areas of coal mines and the coal from those mines instead was taken to the factories in the coastal region'
p8690
aS'now even a small child in this country canunderstand as to how the goods can be utilized for the place where they are situated instead of going for their transport from that place to the other'
p8691
aS'brothers and sisters we changed that decision'
p8692
aS'nearby factories should be the first beneficiaries'
p8693
aS'and let me say that this small decision closed down the shops of the middlemen and the exchequer has got rs'
p8694
aS'1100 crores'
p8695
aS'my dear citizens it will happen every year now'
p8696
aS'corruption in a way has become part of the system'
p8697
aS'until it is stamped out from the system dear brothers and sisters ill keep suffering every atrocity facing every obstacle but with your blessings i shall fulfill the dream of a corruption free india'
p8698
aS'i say this to you from the ramparts of the red fort with the tricolour as my witness and the understanding of the dreams of the 125 crore people'
p8699
aS'its been 15 months since you put our government in centre and gave me the mandate'
p8700
aS'this government does not have any allegation of corruption against it for even a single penny'
p8701
aS'but i had said alongside that it was like the pests the termite'
p8702
aS'corruption free government in delhi only is not going to solve the whole problem'
p8703
aS'there are problems at the small places right now and the poor are getting troubled'
p8704
aS'we need to bring in a national level awareness for this'
p8705
aS'we need to comprehend this menace of corruption properly and get everyone on board to eradicate it'
p8706
aS'then only can we get rid of the menace'
p8707
aS'brothers and sisters let me say further that we have taken some very important steps one after the other to check black money and that too in a very short span of time'
p8708
aS'the day we formed the government we constituted an sit under the supervision of the supreme court'
p8709
aS'we did what was pending for three years'
p8710
aS'the sit is doing its job'
p8711
aS'i attended the g-20 summit'
p8712
aS'these are the countries whose support we need for bringing black money back'
p8713
aS'on indias insistence a resolution was passed against black money'
p8714
aS'all g-20 countries resolved to cooperate with each other and send back the black money to the country where it belonged'
p8715
aS'we adopted fatca along with theunited states'
p8716
aS'we have signed agreements with many countries for receiving real time information regarding indians black money'
p8717
aS'we have taken several measures to check black money'
p8718
aS'brothers and sisters we have passed a strict law for this'
p8719
aS'after this enactment every week people call us and complain that we have passed a very stringent law'
p8720
aS'they call it a draconian law and a black law and say that officers would harass them'
p8721
aS'dear fellow citizens we need injections if the disease is serious'
p8722
aS'doctors also warn us about the side effects of such injections'
p8723
aS'similarly this disease is so serious that if we want a treatment we will have to bear the side effects also'
p8724
aS'i know that people are upset with the law which we have passed'
p8725
aS'they find it troublesome'
p8726
aS'we have received many messages for diluting the provisions and relaxing it'
p8727
aS'today i would like to tell team india of 125 crore countrymen that even while bearing the side effects we are moving forward against black money'
p8728
aS'this much has been done'
p8729
aS'its a fact that the process of bringing back the black money is long but now no one can dare to send the black money out of the country'
p8730
aS'this much has beenachieved whether someone believes it or not'
p8731
aS'not only this we have given some grace period for declaring undisclosed income and today i can say that people have come forward and declared their undisclosed income amounting to rs'
p8732
aS'6500 crores'
p8733
aS'this amount will accrue to our exchequer'
p8734
aS'it will benefit the poor of india'
p8735
aS'friends i assure you all that we will move forward with all the resolve to fulfill the commitments we have made'
p8736
aS'brothers and sisters cbi had registered only eight hundred cases in the entire one year before formation of our government'
p8737
aS'we are still new in power but we have already registered eighteen hundred cases since we took charge we have taken action against government employees'
p8738
aS'you can easily imagine and compare the figures'
p8739
aS'in the entire one year before we came to power only eight hundred cases were registered and in the ten months of our government the corresponding numberis eighteen hundred'
p8740
aS'it shows our ability to fight corruption'
p8741
aS'in 2005 a law namely pmla was framed in our country'
p8742
aS'in ten years an amount of ten thousand crore rupees has been recovered under that law'
p8743
aS'but you would be surprised to know that out of the total recovered amount of ten thousand crore rupees four thousand five hundred crore rupees have been recovered in the last ten months'
p8744
aS'this is another example of our commitment to fight corruption about which we are not talking in press conferences on tv rather we have taken steps onthe ground and reaped success'
p8745
aS'we have endeavored to change systems'
p8746
aS'we have taken steps to ensure that the mgnrega wages go directly to the jan dhan account that the scholarship for students goes directly into their bank accounts and that there is least brokerage'
p8747
aS'and i believe that because of these steps the country can fulfill those objectives'
p8748
aS'my farmer brothers and sisters last year we had deficient rainfall'
p8749
aS'it was less than required'
p8750
aS'it affected the economy as well as our farmers'
p8751
aS'we were still able to curb the price rise'
p8752
aS'one will have to admit the fact that before us the inflation was in double digits'
p8753
aS'since we came to power although there has been less rain and the farmers were distressed we have been successful in bringing down the inflation from double digits to 3-4 percent'
p8754
aS'we will continue to striveto bring it further down because our dream is to provide wholesome meals to the poorest of the poor'
p8755
aS'however we need drastic changes in the agriculture sector'
p8756
aS'the cultivable land is shrinking it is getting divided between families and pieces of land are getting smaller'
p8757
aS'the fertility and productivity of our agricultural land must increase'
p8758
aS'the farmers need water and electricity and we are working towards their availability'
p8759
aS'we have decided to pump in fifty thousand crore rupees inpradhaan mantri krishi sinchaai yojna'
p8760
aS'how will the water reach the farms'
p8761
aS'water will have to be saved'
p8762
aS'we have to launch a movement in our agricultural sector with the mantra of save water save energy and save fertilizers'
p8763
aS'hence per drop more crop is our watchword each drop of water can contribute towards producing more crop and hence successful farming'
p8764
aS'we have moved in the direction of spending funds to take this cause further'
p8765
aS'in the recent past when our crops got damaged due to hailstorm we increased the compensation enormously'
p8766
aS'such an increase has never been witnessed in the past 60 years'
p8767
aS'not only this earlier if there were any losses there was the norm according to which one would be entitled for compensation only if the losses suffered were at least 50 per cent'
p8768
aS'we have brought it down to 30 per cent'
p8769
aS'never in the past 60 years was such a great initiative of helping the farmers taken'
p8770
aS'farmersneed urea'
p8771
aS'i would like to tell once again as to how to fight corruption'
p8772
aS'neem-coating is not the brain child of modi rather it is an idea propounded by scientists and this idea has not only been brought before my government it has come before previous governments as well'
p8773
aS'in our country urea worth millions and billions of rupees is allocated in the names of farmers but 15 20 or 25 per cent of this urea is diverted to the chemical factories as raw material'
p8774
aS'allocated in the names offarmers this urea is pilfered through the middlemen'
p8775
aS'this pilferage of urea can not be stopped unless we go for cent per cent neem-coating of urea'
p8776
aS'therefore irrespective of the burden caused to the exchequer we have accomplished the task of doing hundred per cent neem-coating of urea'
p8777
aS'as a result of this now urea can not be used for any purpose other than farming'
p8778
aS'now no chemical factory can indulge in any kind of pilferage of urea'
p8779
aS'the farmers will have as much urea asthey need'
p8780
aS'since the urea is neem coated even if they use 10 per cent less of urea their land will be benefitted with the nutritional value it requires'
p8781
aS'the farmers of my country will be having a new advantage of urea - i would suggest to all the farmers that even if by chance someone shows you urea without neem-coating you take it to be unauthorized by the government'
p8782
aS'if someone gives you a yellow powder dont even touch it'
p8783
aS'brothers and sisters india can not develop till the eastern part of the country develops'
p8784
aS'india can not be said to be developing only on the basis of the development of the western parts of the country'
p8785
aS'india will move ahead only when our eastern uttar pradesh becomes prosperous our bihar becomes strong our west bengal assam odisha north eastern regions tread the path of development'
p8786
aS'these territories of india should become powerful'
p8787
aS'and so whether is a matter ofinfrastructure or of rail connectivity or of digital connectivity - in all these aspects we have focussed on eastern india'
p8788
aS'this focus has resulted in the proposed laying of a gas pipe line in this region'
p8789
aS'who could have thought that the states where there was no potable tap water even in kitchen there we are working to supply the gas through pipe lines'
p8790
aS'four urea fertilizer plants were shut down in eastern india'
p8791
aS'youth of these states were unemployed and farmers were in distress'
p8792
aS'we havemade new urea policy and we have also formulated new gas supply policy'
p8793
aS'this has resulted in revival of fertilizer plants of eastern centers of gorakhpur barauni talcher and sindari'
p8794
aS'thus we are working to provide employment to the youth and fertilizers to the farmers'
p8795
aS'brothers and sisters there is a government department for army soldiers and for their welfare'
p8796
aS'in our country farmers are as important as soldiers'
p8797
aS'what have we done in sixty years'
p8798
aS'we have emphasized on the economic aspect of agriculture'
p8799
aS'with the intention to have flourishing agriculture and for agricultural advancement the concerned ministry of this government has been named as ministry of agriculture'
p8800
aS'brothers and sisters agricultural growth is as important as the welfare of farmers'
p8801
aS'only talking about agricultural development is incomplete for rural life style and for agriculture based livelihood'
p8802
aS'that will become complete when the welfare of the farmer is also linked'
p8803
aS'brothers and sisters the ministry of the government of india which was earlier known as ministry of agriculture from now will be known as the ministry of farmer welfare and in the days to comeschemes for the welfare of farmers will also be formulated alike the schemes for agriculture are prepared and the government would make efforts to provide help to the farmers by means of setting permanent system for the problems that my farmers has to face in his personal life the hurdles that he has to go through'
p8804
aS'brothers and sisters in the coming days i wish to concentrate on an issue'
p8805
aS'there has been so many years of independence but even today there are about eighteen thousand five hundred such villages in our country where electric wires and polls are yet to reach'
p8806
aS'eighteen thousand five hundred villages are deprived of the sun of independence deprived of the light of independence they are deprived of the rays of development of independence'
p8807
aS'if we will keep on following the oldmethods perhaps it will take ten more years to electrify these eighteen thousand five hundred villages with wires and polls'
p8808
aS'the country is not ready to wait for ten years'
p8809
aS'i took the meeting of government officials and enquired from them about the timeline'
p8810
aS'someone promised to complete the task till 2019 someone assured to complete it till 2022'
p8811
aS'some were hesitant due to dense forests or snowy hills and some had apprehension due to inaccessibility of certain areas'
p8812
aS'but it is now the solemn pledge of the team india of 1'
p8813
aS'25 billion countrymen that the target of providing electric polls electric wires and electricity to these 18500villages would be achieved within next 1000 days'
p8814
aS'i urge upon the states to come forward and accept this challenge'
p8815
aS'this is not pending in every state only a few states will have to strive a little further'
p8816
aS'i would not like to count the name of such states as it would be viewed politically and may attract political comments'
p8817
aS'hence its better to avoid it'
p8818
aS'i therefore announce the pledge of the team india of our 1'
p8819
aS'25 billion countrymen from the red fort that electricity would bemade available to 18500 villages within the next 1000 days with the help of states and local bodies'
p8820
aS'i have taken up another issue of concern which is welfare of farmers'
p8821
aS'similar issue of grave concern is the under-development of such mining areas from where we get mineral resources such as coal bauxite and other minerals'
p8822
aS'now look at the life of people there'
p8823
aS'they sweat to make our country rich but that region is not developed and therefore we have formulated a special scheme for the development of the labourers and farmers of the region from where minerals are extractedand around rupees six thousand crores will be spent every year on the regions which fall in the areas of my tribals brothers located in my tribal areas'
p8824
aS'where coal is found'
p8825
aS'coal is found in tribal areas'
p8826
aS'we have undertaken work to see development takes place there'
p8827
aS'brother and sisters our youth power is of import for taking the country forward in twenty first century and today i want to declare that if we have to move ahead in comparison to the whole world we have to encourage our youths we have to provide them opportunities'
p8828
aS'how our youths become new entrepreneurs how our youths become new producers how a complete network of start-up by these new entrepreneurs is set up in the whole country'
p8829
aS'there should not be any district any block inhindustan where there are not start-up initiated in the coming days'
p8830
aS'whether india can not dream that india becomes number one in the world of start-up'
p8831
aS'today we are not at that position'
p8832
aS'brothers and sisters i have to provide strength to start-up and therefore i resolve that in the coming days start-up india and stand-up india will be there or the future of the country'
p8833
aS'and for a bright future of the country stand-up india shall be launched when i want to moveforward this job pertaining to start-up india stand-up india my brothers and sisters in our country our bank officials have done a herculean task and when you do a good job my expectations rise a lot'
p8834
aS'my banker friends my expectations are rising so please do not get offended but i trust you that your subordinate staff is contributing a lot for the economic advancement of this nation and in future they will continue to put in further more efforts'
p8835
aS'i want to assign you a task today'
p8836
aS'there are 1'
p8837
aS'25 lakhs banking units i'
p8838
ag1875
aS'1'
p8839
aS'25 lakhs branches of banks in the country'
p8840
aS'today i would like to assign a task to these 1'
p8841
aS'25 lakhs branches'
p8842
aS'this year marks the 125th anniversary of dr'
p8843
aS'babasaheb ambedkarji'
p8844
aS'there are 1 crore 25 lakhs branches of banks'
p8845
aS'this is my programme referred to as start-up india under this programme more schemes will be formulated but every branch must resolve and in the days to come resolve once again to disburse loans for start-ups to the tribals in the locality where there is any tribal habitation and where there is no tribal habitation the branch can provide loans to a dalit or a tribal give financial support to them and thusenable 1'
p8846
aS'25 lakhs dalit entrepreneurs to come up'
p8847
aS'let there be tribal entrepreneurs in the tribal settlements of this country'
p8848
aS'we can do this we can give a new dimension to start-up and secondly whether these one lakh twenty five thousand branches can formulate a special scheme for women entrepreneurs'
p8849
aS'these one lakh twenty five thousand branches should promote start-up of women entrepreneurs and help them financially'
p8850
aS'you will find that with in no time india would see a network ofstart up new entrepreneurs would emerge and they would in-turn provide employment ranging form one to two to four persons which will transform indias economic life'
p8851
aS'brothers and sisters when investment comes to the country we expect more manufacturing work and more exports and the finance department of the government offer new schemes to such investors'
p8852
aS'it has its own significance and this should continue'
p8853
aS'but today i have a new idea that the investment coming to our country in the manufacturing sector should be offered assistance based on new parameters and one of them shall be that an investor who comes with an enterprise which providesemployment to maximum persons would be eligible for a different kind of economic package'
p8854
aS'the government would now formulate new schemes for new units linking it with employment and assistance of government'
p8855
aS'we want to stress upon the growth of employment opportunities in the country'
p8856
aS'we have reached far beyond in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of skill india and digital india'
p8857
aS'brothers and sisters one area of corruption is job'
p8858
aS'the poorest of the poor man aspires for his sons job and we have seen that whenever a youth receives a call for an interview for a job may be that is for interview in railway for a teacher for a peon for a driver he began to think about who he should approach for recommendation'
p8859
aS'even his widow mother begin to brood over the issue'
p8860
aS'why'
p8861
aS'that is because in our country justice and injustice are mostly decided on the basis of interview rather than the basis of merit and it is said that the person has failed in the interview'
p8862
aS'i have not seen any such psychologist till now who are capable of assessing a person onthe basis of interviewing him just for two minutes'
p8863
aS'brothers and sisters i have been thinking over it for many days that whether it is necessary to appear for an interview for a son of a poor mother for a less educated person who is in need of petty jobs'
p8864
aS'whether he cant get any job without an interview'
p8865
aS'whether on the basis of his mark-sheet online -- it should be decided on the basis of online mark sheet that if we require five hundred people than who should be those initial five hundred people then who should be initialtwo thousand people'
p8866

p9176
aS'and i am not talking about those in public office here or in india'
p9177
aS'its a great pleasure to be here in california'
p9178
aS'it is one of the last places in the world to see the sun set'
p9179
aS'but it is here that new ideas see the first light of the day'

aS'i have met many of you in delhi and new york and on facebook twitter and instagram'
p9182
aS'these are the new neighborhoods of our new world'

aS'twitter has turned everyone into a reporter'
p9186

p9190
aS'from cleaner energy to better healthcare and safer transport everything is converging around the work you do'
p9191
aS'in africa its helping people transfer money on phone'
p9192
aS'it has made reaching small island states no longer a journey of adventure but a convenient click of a mouse'
p9193
aS'in india a mother in a distant hill village has a better chance to save her new born infant'
p9194
aS'a child in a remote village has better access to education'
p9195
aS'a small farmer is more confident about his land holding and getting better market price'
p9196
aS'a fisherman on the sea has a better catch'
p9197
aS'and a young professional in san francisco can skype daily to comfort her sick grandmother in india'
p9198
aS'an initiative by a father in haryana for selfie with daughter to draw attention to the girl child became an international movement'
p9199
aS'all this is because of the work you people are doing'
p9200
aS'since my government came to office last year we have attacked poverty by using the power of networks and mobile phones to launch a new era of empowerment and inclusion 180 million new bank accounts in a few months direct transfer of benefits to the poor funds for the unbanked insurance within the reach of the poorest and pension for the sunset years for all'
p9201
aS'by using space technology and internet we have been able to identify in the last few months 170 applications that will make governance better and development faster'
p9202
aS'when a small craftsman in a village in india brings a smile to a customer looking at his phone on a metro ride in new york when a heart patient in a remote hospital in kyrgyz republic is treated by doctors sitting in delhi as i saw in bishkek we know we are creating something that has fundamentally changed our lives'
p9203
aS'the pace at which people are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age education language and income'
p9204
aS'i like recounting my meeting with a group of unlettered tribal women in a remote part of gujarat'
p9205
aS'they were present at a local milk chilling plant i was inaugurating'
p9206
aS'they were using cell phones to take photographs of the event'
p9207
aS'i asked them what they would do with the images'
p9208
aS'the answer was a surprise for me'
p9209
aS'they said they would go back have the images downloaded on to a computer and take printouts'
p9210
aS'yes they were familiar with the language of our digital world'
p9211
aS'and farmers in maharashtra state have created a whatsapp group to share information on farming practices'
p9212
aS'customers more than creators are defining the use of a product'
p9213
aS'the world may be driven by the same ancient impulses'
p9214
aS'we will continue to see human struggles and successes'
p9215
aS'we will witness human glory and tragedies'
p9216
aS'but in this digital age we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago'
p9217
aS'this is what sets us apart from the century that we have just left behind'
p9218
aS'there may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich educated and the privileged'
p9219
aS'but ask the taxi driver or the corner vendor in india what he has gained from his cell phone and the debate gets settled'
p9220
aS'i see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity'
p9221
aS'social media is reducing social barriers'
p9222
aS'it connects people on thestrength of human values not identities'
p9223
aS'today technology is advancing citizen empowerment and democracy that once drew their strength from constitutions'
p9224
aS'technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes'
p9225
aS'when you think of the exponential speed and scale of expansion of social media or a service you have to believe that it is equally possible to rapidly transform the lives of those who have long stood on the margins of hope'
p9226
aS'so friends out of this conviction was born the vision of digital india'
p9227
aS'it is an enterprise for indias transformation on a scale that is perhaps unmatched in human history'
p9228
aS'not just to touch the lives of the weakest farthest and the poorest citizen of india but change the way our nation will live and work'
p9229
aS'for nothing else will do in a country with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years impatient for change and eager to achieve it'
p9230
aS'we will transform governance making it more transparent accountable accessible and participative'
p9231
aS'i spoke of e-governance as a foundation of better governance efficient economical and effective'
p9232
aS'i now speak of m-governance or mobile governance'
p9233
aS'that is the way to go in a country with one billion cell phones and use of smart phones growing at high double digit rates'
p9234
aS'it has the potential to make development a truly inclusive and comprehensive mass movement'
p9235
aS'it puts governance within everyones reach'
p9236
aS'after mygov'
p9237
aS'in i have just launched the narendra modi mobile app'
p9238
aS'they are helping me stay in close touch with people'
p9239
aS'i learn a great deal from their suggestions and complaints'
p9240
aS'we want to free our citizens from the burden of excessive paper documents in every office'
p9241
aS'we want paperless transactions'
p9242
aS'we will set up a digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments'
p9243
aS'we have set up ebiz portal to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient so that they concentrate their energy on their goals not on government processes'
p9244
aS'we are using technology to impart scale and speed to development'
p9245
aS'information education skills healthcare livelihood financial inclusion small and village enterprises opportunities for women conservation of natural resources distributed clean energy entirely new possibilities have emerged to change the development model'
p9246
aS'but for all this we must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy'
p9247
aS'we must ensure that technology is accessible affordable and adds value'
p9248
aS'we want our 1'
p9249
aS'25 billion citizens to be digitally connected'
p9250
aS'we already have broadband usage across india go up by 63 last year'
p9251
aS'we need to accelerate this further'
p9252
aS'we have launched an aggressive expansion of the national optical fibre network that will take broadband to our 600000 villages'
p9253
aS'we will connect all schools and colleges with broadband'
p9254
aS'building i-ways are as important as highways'
p9255
aS'we are expanding our public wi-fi hotspots'
p9256
aS'for example we want to ensure that free wi fi is not only there in airport lounges but also on our railway platforms'
p9257
aS'teaming up with google we will cover 500 railway stations in a short time'
p9258
aS'we are also setting up common service centres in villages and towns'
p9259
aS'we will also use information technology to build smart cities'
p9260
aS'and we want to turn our villages into smart economic hubs and connect our farmers better to markets and makes them less vulnerable to the whims of weather'
p9261
aS'for me access also means that content should be in local languages'
p9262
aS'in a country with 22 official languages it is a formidable but an important task'
p9263
aS'affordability of products and services is critical for our success'
p9264
aS'there are many dimensions to this'
p9265
aS'we will promote manufacture of quality and affordable products in india'
p9266
aS'that is part of our vision of make in india digital india and design in india'
p9267
aS'as our economy and our lives get more wired we are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security intellectual property rights and cyber security'
p9268
aS'and i know to achieve the vision of digital india the government must also start thinking a bit like you'
p9269
aS'so from creating infrastructure to services from manufacture of products to human resource development from support governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy digital india is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you'
p9270
aS'the task is huge the challenges are many'
p9271
aS'but we also know that we will not reach new destinations without taking new roads'
p9272
aS'much of india that we dream of is yet to be built'
p9273
aS'so we have the opportunity to shape its path now'
p9274
aS'and we have the talent enterprise and skills to succeed'
p9275
aS'we also have the strength of the partnership between india and the united states'
p9276
aS'indians and americans have worked together to shape the knowledge economy'
p9277
aS'they have made us aware of the vast potential of technology'
p9278
aS'from large corporate to young professionals in this great centre of innovation each can be part of the digital india story'
p9279
aS'the sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be a major force of good for our world and our planet'
p9280
aS'today we speak of india-u'
p9281
aS's'
p9282
aS'partnership as a defining partnership of this century'
p9283
aS'it hinges on two major reasons'
p9284
aS'both converge here in california'
p9285
aS'we all know that the dynamic asia pacific region will shape the course of this century'
p9286
aS'and india and the united states the worlds two largest democracies are located at the two ends of this region'
p9287
aS'we have the responsibility to shape a future of peace stability and prosperity in this region'
p9288
aS'our relationship is also defined by the power of youth technology and innovation'
p9289
aS'these can ignite a partnership that will advance and sustain prosperity in our two countries'
p9290
aS'even more in this digital age we can draw on the strength of our values and partnership to shape a better and more sustainable future for the world'

p9298
aS'on behalf of my government and all the co-hosts for this international summit i warmly welcome you to theglobal call to action summit 2015'
p9299
aS'this is a landmark occasion as for the first time the global call to action summit is being held outside usa'
p9300
aS'my government is honoured to host this summit'
p9301
aS'all those delegates who have travelled a long distance to attend this summit i heartily welcome you to india and to new delhi'
p9302
aS'i am delighted to be with you this morning'
p9303
aS'this two-day summit celebrating the achievements of the participating countries in the area of maternal and child health was conceptualized to accelerate joint leadership for ending preventable deaths among mothers and children'
p9304
aS'it will showcase the power of new partnerships innovations and systems to bring about improvements in life-saving interventions'
p9305
aS'i firmly believe that this summit will provide a highly effective platform to address common challenges that willhelp us achieve the desired goals'
p9306
aS'how we shape the world in the next 15 years will make the difference between prosperous optimistic nations and insecurity and unrest'
p9307
aS'i am glad to see 24 nations present here to join together in their commitment to end preventable maternal and child death'
p9308
aS'this is a call to action to all of us to seize this opportunity and think big'
p9309
aS'today as we gather here to discuss strategies and as we transit from the millennium development goals to sustainable development goals let us acknowledge the sad reality that the world continues to lose about 289 thousand mothers and 6'
p9310
aS'3 million under-5 children every year'
p9311
aS'the 24 priority countries participating in the summit contribute nearly 70 of the preventable maternal and child deaths'
p9312
aS'for india with its birth cohort of 26 million the challenges are formidable butthe commitment to succeed is also as strong'
p9313
aS'what however does offer hope is that most of these deaths can be prevented through simple yet effective and proven interventions'
p9314
aS'this forms the key peg for this summit'
p9315
aS'this also formed a crucial part of the joint statement issued subsequent to the visit of the us president in january this year where we agreed to further accelerate the joint leadership to end all preventable maternal and child deaths'
p9316
aS'keeping aside the work that still needs to be done there have been significant achievements on the global front in the area of maternal and child health'
p9317
aS'looking at the big picture we find that in 1990 indias under-five mortality rate stood at 126 while the global average was 90'
p9318
aS'in 2013 this figure dropped to 49 against a global average of 46'
p9319
aS'therefore the gap to the global average reduced from 36 points in 1990 to just 3 points in 2013 reflecting that india has achievedunder-five mortality rate decline at an accelerated pace compared to global rate of decline'
p9320
aS'what this translates into is this india is likely to reach close to achieving the mdg target if the current trend of annual decline is sustained'
p9321
aS'in addition to this remarkable achievement another truly historic accomplishment has been the victory over polio'
p9322
aS'india was declared as polio-free on 27 march 2014'
p9323
aS'from being a country which accounted for more than half of the global polio cases in 2009 to being declared free of the wild polio virus the journey reflects indias deep commitment to child health'
p9324
aS'i am also happy to share with you today another major milestone achieved by india'
p9325
aS'india has eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus'
p9326
aS'the validation for this has happened much before the global target date of december 2015'
p9327
aS'this gives us the confidence to achieve other targets well before the target date'
p9328
aS'to sustain the efforts of being a polio-free and maternal and neonatal tetanus free nation and to accelerate the full immunization coverage in the country my government has added to the worlds largest immunization drive another mission known as mission indradhanush'
p9329
aS'it focusses on vaccinating the left-outs'
p9330
aS'it also targets to accelerate the current increase in annual rate of immunization from existing 1 to more than 5 per year'
p9331
aS'this will help us achieve more than 90 coverage by2020 which otherwise would take more than 25 years at the current pace'
p9332
aS'the first phase has been successfully implemented'
p9333
aS'we want to ensure that no child in india dies of a vaccine-preventable disease'
p9334
aS'india has always partnered with the global efforts on issues of child and maternal health'
p9335
aS'india is the first country to respond to the global commitment to reduce newborn mortality subsequent to the launch of global every newborn action plan enap at the world health assembly in june 2014'
p9336
aS'india launched the india newborn action plan inap in september 2014 targeting reduction in neonatal mortality rate nmr and still births to single digit by 2030'
p9337
aS'india also responded byacting on the first call to action through its commitment and launch of rmncha'
p9338
aS'these remarkable successes in the field of maternal and child health have been possible through our national health mission nhm'
p9339
aS'the mission with its urban and rural health components perhaps one of the largest public health programmes in the world has resulted in improved health outcomes'
p9340
aS'52 of indias under-5 mortality is contributed to by deaths of newborns in the first month of life'
p9341
aS'under the nhm our approach emphasises a continuum of newborn care both at the communityand facility level'
p9342
aS'our focus has been to get pregnant women to have safe delivery in our institutions'
p9343
aS'we launched an ambitious program janani suraksha yojana jsy wherein incentives were given for delivering in public institutions to the beneficiaries directly'
p9344
aS'as a result today more than 75 of the deliveries take place in our institutions'
p9345
aS'this has directly contributed to reduction in maternal mortality'
p9346
aS'we are fully aware that out-of-pocket expenses remain a key barrier forwomen to access timely health care and services'
p9347
aS'to overcome this we have launched a programme called janani shishu suraksha karyakram jssk under which every woman delivering in a public health institution as well as the newborn is entitled to free and cashless health services with an assured provision of free drugs diagnostics and diet besides free to and fro transport'
p9348
aS'this has helped to further improve our institutional deliveries'
p9349
aS'not only are the mothers provided focused health services but individual beneficiary tracking is being done through the countrywide maternal and child health tracking system which ensures close tracking of inputs and outputs at the level of service provision'
p9350
aS'more than 92 million mothers and 78 million children have already been registered so far in the system'
p9351
aS'one of our major concerns is equity'
p9352
aS'as a step towards ensuring equitable health services across regions that suffer from intra-state disparities and to bring about sharper improvements in health outcomes a total of 184 poorest performing districts all over the country have been identified'
p9353
aS'special efforts are being made to put in more resources and focussed programmes in these areas'
p9354
aS'one of the flagship programmes of my government is the swacch bharat abhiyaan the clean india campaign'
p9355
aS'as a part of this large campaign the health ministry has launched the kayakalp scheme to encourage public health facilities to maintain high standards of hygiene and sanitation as i firmly believe that clean and hygienic environment is the stepping stone to a healthy nation'
p9356
aS'to save and educate the girl child we have launched an ambitious program beti bachao beti padhao'
p9357
aS'we need to ensure that the girl child survives thrives and plays a very crucial role in society'
p9358
aS'i have witnessed people getting poorer because of unfortunate health episodes'
p9359
aS'we need to institutionalise a system where marginalised communities receive universal health care and financial protection'
p9360
aS'we must experiment and learn from each other'
p9361
aS'india stands ready to boost its commitment and partner with other countries and move forward on our promise to end maternal and child deaths and provide a better life to the adolescent'
p9362
aS'i invite you to commit to bold measures and holdeach other accountable to these promises'
p9363
aS'as we assemble here we need to send a very very strong message not only to ourselves not only to the 24 countries present here but to the entire world'
p9364
aS'the message is of our commitment that we will ensure that every woman every child who can be saved will be saved'
p9365
aS'we also need to make a clarion call to the world to join hands in taking such steps that would ensure this'
p9366
aS'india stands committed to not only allocate resources towards this in our country but also to helpthe world and all those countries which needed any support'
p9367
aS'it is my personal vision and my governments firm commitment'
p9368
aS'while every country present here has something to offer india also has a wealth of experience'
p9369
aS'india has done well in many ways and would be extremely happy to share its experience with other countries'
p9370
aS'last year i had made a commitment of assisting the saarc countries in keeping it polio free'
p9371
aS'we have also made a commitment to provide pentavalent vaccines to such saarc countries as would need it'
p9372
aS'we will offer whatever experience we have to the world community'
p9373
aS'india would be happy to assist any country with technology system strengthening and programme implementation capsules'
p9374
aS'we could train personnel and skill them for better management of child sickness in our special newborn care units sncus as well as share our experience at home based new born care'
p9375
aS'indias rich experience in universal immunization and particularly its experience this year with the mission indradhanush could be shared with all the countries'
p9376
aS'we had offeredthis to saarc countries earlier'
p9377
aS'today i repeat this offer to all countries present here'
p9378
aS'this will be apart from our offer of support for polio eradication'
p9379
aS'i again warmly welcome you all to this important international summit'
p9380
aS'i hope the next two days would provide a new direction to the global community in its journey towards ending maternal and child deaths'

p9388
aS'i am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers'
p9389
aS'i had made a humble request that on the occasion of raksha bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift'
p9390
aS'the preliminary information that i have notifies me that from launch till date around 11 crore families have joined this scheme'
p9391
aS'and i have been told that almost half the beneficiaries are women the mothers and the daughters'
p9392
aS'i consider this as a positive sign'
p9393
aS'i offer my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on this blessed occasion of raksha bandhan'
p9394
aS'today when i talk to you i want to mention that around a year back the jan dhan yojana was started at a large scale'
p9395
aS'a task which could not be achieved in the past 60 years would it be possible to achieve it in such a small span of time'
p9396
aS'many questions were being raised but i am happy to tell you that all the units of the government and all the banks put in tremendous effort and as per my knowledge till date close to 18 crore people have opened their bank accounts 17 crore 74lakh to be precise'
p9397
aS'i saw the richness of the poor'
p9398
aS'they had to open zero balance accounts'
p9399
aS'but these poor people saved money and deposited a sum of 22000 crores'
p9400
aS'banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the poor the programme of bank mitra is being strengthened'
p9401
aS'today more than 1'
p9402
aS'25 lakh bank mitras are serving in the country'
p9403
aS'the youth have got employment this way'
p9404
aS'you will be pleased to know that in this one year to connect thebanking sector economy and the poor people over 1 lakh 31 thousand financial literacy camps have been organized'
p9405
aS'one just does not have to open account and get stuck'
p9406
aS'thousands of people under the jan dhan yojana are now eligible to take an overdraft and they have availed it too'
p9407
aS'now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank'
p9408
aS'i would again like to congratulate all the people associated with this initiative and i would like to request the poor brethrenwho have opened an account to never severe this relationship'
p9409
aS'these are your banks and now you should never leave them'
p9410
aS'i have brought them to you now it is your job to keep them going'
p9411
aS'all of our accounts should be kept active'
p9412
aS'i have the faith that you will definitely continue operating the bank accounts'
p9413
aS'in the past few days the events in gujarat the violence unsettled the entire country'
p9414
aS'it is natural that if something of this sort happens in the land of mahatma and sardar patel then the nation is definitely shocked and hurt'
p9415
aS'but in a very short span of time the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in gujarat brought the entire situation under control'
p9416
aS'they played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again gujarat started its peaceful march'
p9417
aS'peace unity and brotherhood is the right way forward'
p9418
aS'we have to walk together towards the path of development'
p9419
aS'development is the key to our problems'
p9420
aS'sometime back i had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the sufi tradition'
p9421
aS'i had the opportunity to hear them speak'
p9422
aS'and truly speaking of the experience and the manner in which they presented their views sounded as if some music was being played'
p9423
aS'their choice of words their way of talking the generosity of the sufi tradition its sublimity its lyricism i could experience it all'
p9424
aS'i felt very nice'
p9425
aS'i think it has become imperative to present islam in its true form to the world'
p9426
aS'i amconfident that the sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit islam'
p9427
aS'and i would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows we should definitely experience sufism once'
p9428
aS'i am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and i consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation'
p9429
aS'various buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at bodh gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level'
p9430
aS'i have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and i am glad to be invited at bodh gaya'
p9431
aS'pandit nehru the first prime minister of india visited bodh gaya'
p9432
aS'and now i will be going there with these scholars thisgives me immense happiness'
p9433
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters today i would again like to especially share my mann ki baat with you'
p9434
aS'i have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of mann ki baat'
p9435
aS'you must have heard me speak in the parliament in public forums or mann ki baat about it'
p9436
aS'i have always said that the government is open to all views and suggestions on the issue of land acquisition act on which a debate is going on'
p9437
aS'i have reiterated again and again that i am open to any suggestion in theinterest of the farmers'
p9438
aS'but today i want to tell all my farmer brothers and sisters that the request to reform the land acquisition act was raised by the states very emphatically'
p9439
aS'everyone felt that if the welfare of the farmers is to be achieved if the water has to reach the fields if poles are to be erected to provide electricity if roads have to be constructed in the village if houses are to be made for the poor in the village if employment opportunities are to beprovided to the poor youth of rural areas then we have to free the land from legal hassles and bureaucratic hurdles'
p9440
aS'and hence this reformed proposal was introduced'
p9441
aS'but i saw how the framers were being misled and a fear psychosis created'
p9442
aS'my dear farmers you should not be misled and definitely never be scared'
p9443
aS'and i do not wish to give anyone the opportunity to mislead you and scare you'
p9444
aS'for me every single voice in the nation is important but most important to me is the voice of thefarmer'
p9445
aS'we had issued an ordinance'
p9446
aS'tomorrow on august 31st the deadline for this ordinance ends'
p9447
aS'i have decided that let this ordinance be lapsed'
p9448
aS'this means that now same situation exists as it was prior to the formation of my government'
p9449
aS'but in the same act there was a job which was incomplete'
p9450
aS'this job was related to 13 points which were to be completed within a year and so we brought the ordinance but due to these disputes the issue got stuck'
p9451
aS'the ordinance is coming toan end but those 13 points which were to benefit farmers which is directly connected to the monetary issues of the farmers will be made into a law and will be implemented today itself so that the farmers do not suffer any losses especially monetary losses'
p9452
aS'and hence the task of implementing the 13 points which was left incomplete in the earlier act is being accomplished today'
p9453
aS'i want to reassure my farmer brothers and sisters that jai jawan jai kisan is not merely a slogan itis our guiding mantra'
p9454
aS'the guiding mantra is the welfare of the villages and the poor farmers'
p9455
aS'that is why i declared on 15th august that it is not just an agricultural department but an agricultural and farmer welfare department will be created'
p9456
aS'we are steadily working on it'
p9457
aS'so my dear farmers there is no need to be misled now and especially there is no need for you to fear anything'
p9458
aS'do not be scared even if someone tries to scare you'
p9459
aS'i have to say something more'
p9460
aS'two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war'
p9461
aS'and whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember lal bahadur shastri'
p9462
aS'it is also but natural that we remember his slogan jai jawan jai kisan'
p9463
aS'it is also natural that we remember our jawans who sacrificed their lives to maintain the pride and honour of our tricolor flag'
p9464
aS'i salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war'
p9465
aS'i pay my tribute to the brave soldiers'
p9466
aS'maywe continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history'
p9467
aS'like i had the chance of meeting the sufi scholars similarly i had another great experience'
p9468
aS'i had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country'
p9469
aS'i had the opportunity to hear them and i was very happy to know that india is doing commendable research in the field of science'
p9470
aS'our scientists are doing some excellent work'
p9471
aS'now the challenge is to take these researches to the common man'
p9472
aS'how to convert these theories into machineries'
p9473
aS'how toconnect laboratory to the land'
p9474
aS'we have to take this forward as an opportunity'
p9475
aS'i got a lot of new information'
p9476
aS'i can say that it was both inspiring and educative experience for me'
p9477
aS'and i saw how the young scientists were eager to explain their work and their eyes were full of dreams'
p9478
aS'in the previous episode of mann ki baat i had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science'
p9479
aS'after this meeting i felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities'
p9480
aS'i would like to reiterate once again that our young friends take interest in science and our educational institutions should also encourage the students for the same'
p9481
aS'i receive many letters from the citizens'
p9482
aS'mr parimal shah from thane talks about educational reforms on my portal mygov'
p9483
aS'in'
p9484
aS'they have written about skill development'
p9485
aS'mr prakash tripathi from chidambaram in tamil nadu emphasizes the need for good teachers at primary level'
p9486
aS'they have emphasized on reforms in the educational set ups'
p9487
aS'i especially want to make a point to my young friends'
p9488
aS'i had mentioned from the red fort that why should there be interviews for the lower posts'
p9489
aS'and when they do get the interview letter - the poor the widowed mother start thinking who to reach for recommendation who can help get the job whose jack could be useful to get that job'
p9490
aS'i do not know what all kind of words are being used'
p9491
aS'every one rushes and that seems to be one reason for corruption at the lower levels'
p9492
aS'ihad mentioned in my speech on 15th august 2015 that this tradition of interview should at least end at some level'
p9493
aS'i am happy that in such a short span of time it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace'
p9494
aS'information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews'
p9495
aS'now the poor will not have to run for recommendation'
p9496
aS'this will end exploitation and corruption'
p9497
aS'these days many guests from foreign countries have arrived in india'
p9498
aS'24 countries from across the globe discussed on the indian soil a call to action to reduce maternal mortality and infant mortality rates'
p9499
aS'it was the first time that this programme was organized in any other country outside america'
p9500
aS'and it is true that in our country about 50000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year'
p9501
aS'this is a cause of worry andthese figures are scary'
p9502
aS'although a lot of improvement has taken place'
p9503
aS'india is being appreciated at the international level for its efforts but this statistics is not low'
p9504
aS'like we became polio free similarly we became free from tetanus as a cause of maternal and child mortality'
p9505
aS'the world has accepted this'
p9506
aS'but we still have to work to save our mothers and our children'
p9507
aS'dear countrymen there is news of dengue everywhere'
p9508
aS'it is true that dengue is dangerous but prevention of dengue is easier'
p9509
aS'it is directly related to the swatch bharat campaign that i talk about'
p9510
aS'we watch the advertisement on tv but do not pay attention'
p9511
aS'there are advertisements in the newspapers but it escapes our attention'
p9512
aS'there are several ways of keeping the smallest thing in the household clean by using pure water'
p9513
aS'a lot of public education programmes are beingconducted but we do not pay attention'
p9514
aS'we feel that we live in very good houses with proper arrangements being totally unaware that water is collecting at some location in the house and that we are inviting dengue'
p9515
aS'i would request you all that do not make death so cheap'
p9516
aS'life is very precious'
p9517
aS'a little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death which i believe is not right'
p9518
aS'in the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue casesabsolutely free of cost'
p9519
aS'it is necessary to get ourselves tested on time to save precious lives'
p9520
aS'cooperation from all of you is very important for this menace'
p9521
aS'and cleanliness should be given great importance'
p9522
aS'from raksha bandhan to diwali there will be many festivals'
p9523
aS'why dont we associate each festival with cleaniness'
p9524
aS'you will see how a tradition becomes your habit'
p9525
aS'my dear countrymen i want to share good news with you'
p9526
aS'like i said we may not get a chance to die for our nation but we can be fortunate to live for the country'
p9527
aS'there are two young brothers and that too from nashik in our own state of maharashtra'
p9528
aS'dr'
p9529
aS'hitendra mahajan and dr'
p9530
aS'mahendra mahajan both with a keen desire to help our tribal population'
p9531
aS'these two brothers have brought pride to the nation'
p9532
aS'in america a difficult cycle race of about 4800 kms known as race across america isorganized'
p9533
aS'this year both these brothers have won this race'
p9534
aS'they have made us proud'
p9535
aS'i would like to congratulate both these brothers and send my best wishes'
p9536
aS'but i was happier to know that they do all this for their campaign team india vision for tribals'
p9537
aS'see everyone is doing their bit for taking the country forward'
p9538
aS'and this it when you hear such things the heart swells with pride'
p9539
aS'sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception'
p9540
aS'the old generation feels that the new generation does not understand anything and i understand that this has been going on for ages'
p9541
aS'my experience regarding youth is different'
p9542
aS'sometimes when we talk to the youth we learn so many things'
p9543
aS'i have met so many youth who have taken the pledge sunday on cycle'
p9544
aS'some say that i keep one day a week as cycle-day as it is good for my health'
p9545
aS'it is good for theenvironment'
p9546
aS'and i enjoy my youth too'
p9547
aS'nowadays many cities in our country are witnessing cycle use and there are many people promoting its use'
p9548
aS'but this is a good initiative both for improving health and saving the environment'
p9549
aS'and today when two youths of my country made india proud in the us i thought of it worth mentioning'
p9550
aS'today i especially want to congratulate the maharashtra government'
p9551
aS'it makes me happy'
p9552
aS'the task for erecting a memorial for baba sahib ambedkar in the indu mill compounds had been stuck for long'
p9553
aS'the new government in maharashtra completed this task and now a grand memorial will be erected which will inspire us to work for the dalits exploited and the marginalized'
p9554
aS'but along with this the house in uk where baba saheb lived 10 king henry road has been purchased too'
p9555
aS'theglobetrotting indians on their trip to uk can visit the memorial being erected by the maharashtra government'
p9556
aS'it will be inspirational to many'
p9557
aS'i congratulate the maharashtra government on the accomplishment of both these tasks'
p9558
aS'my dear brothers and sisters do share your views before the next mann ki baat for i believe that democracy runs through public participation'
p9559
aS'we can take the nation forward when we work together'

p9566
aS'this is truly an esteemed gathering of spiritual leaders scholars and leaders from several countries of the world where buddhism is a prevalent way of life'
p9567
aS'it is a matter of immense happiness that this conference is being held in india including in bodh gaya'
p9568
aS'india is the ideal venue to host a symposium of this nature'
p9569
aS'we in india are proud of the fact that it was from this land that gautama buddha gave the world the tenets of buddhism'
p9570
aS'the life of gautama buddha illustrates the power of service compassion and most importantly renunciation'
p9571
aS'he was born into privilege'
p9572
aS'the hardships he faced were relatively fewer'
p9573
aS'yet with age grew a distinct consciousness about human suffering about illness about old age and about death'
p9574
aS'he was convinced that material wealth is not the sole goal'
p9575
aS'human conflicts repulsed him'
p9576
aS'and then he set out on the path to create a peaceful and compassionate society'
p9577
aS'in those days he had the courage and conviction to hold a mirror to the society and sought to break free from practices and systems seen as regressive'
p9578
aS'gautam buddha was a revolutionary'
p9579
aS'he nurtured a faith where a human being is at the core nothing else'
p9580
aS'the innermost being of man manifests godliness'
p9581
aS'in a way he created a faith without god and a faith where divinity is not about looking anywhere outside but about looking within'
p9582
aS'in three words appa deepo bhavah or be your own light gautam buddha gave humanity the greatest management lesson'
p9583
aS'nothing pained him more than mindless conflict that caused humansuffering'
p9584
aS'non-violence was integral to his worldview'
p9585
aS'the message and teachings of gautama buddha resonate loudly and clearly with the major themes chosen for this symposium the themes of avoiding conflicts moving towards environmental consciousness and a concept of free and frank dialogue'
p9586
aS'the three themes may appear independent but they are not mutually exclusive'
p9587
aS'infact they are mutually dependent and supportive'
p9588
aS'the conflict in the first theme is among humans religions communities and nation-states also between non-state actors and states and even the world'
p9589
aS'intolerant non-state actors now control large territories where they are unleashing barbaric violence on innocent people'
p9590
aS'the second conflict is between nature and man between nature and development and also between nature and science'
p9591
aS'these types of conflicts call for dialogue to bring about conflict avoidance not just give and take conflict resolution negotiations as what is happening today'
p9592
aS'ethical values of personal restraint in consumption and environmental consciousness are deeply rooted in asian philosophical traditions especially in hinduism and buddhism'
p9593
aS'buddhism along with other faiths such as confucianism taoism and shintoism has undertaken greater responsibility to protect the environment'
p9594
aS'hinduism and buddhism with their well-defined treatises on mother earth can help examine the changes in approach that need to be made'
p9595
aS'climate change is a pressing global challenge'
p9596
aS'it calls for a collective human action and a comprehensive response'
p9597
aS'in india faith and nature have had a deep link since ancient times'
p9598
aS'buddhism and environment are deeply co-related'
p9599
aS'the buddhist tradition in all of its historical and cultural manifestations encourages greater identification with the natural world because from a buddhist perspective nothing has a separate existence'
p9600
aS'the impurities in the environment affect the mind and the impurities of mind also pollute the environment'
p9601
aS'in order to purify the environment we have to purify the mind'
p9602
aS'the eco crisis in fact is a reflection of imbalance of mind'
p9603
aS'lord buddha therefore accorded importance to the need for preserving natural resources and created tools related to water conservation and forbid the monks from polluting water resources'
p9604
aS'the nature forests trees and the well-being of all beings play a great role in the teachings of lord buddha'
p9605
aS'i wrote a book convenient action which was released by the former president of india dr'
p9606
aS'apj abdul kalam'
p9607
aS'in my book i have shared my experiences of dealing with climate change as the chief minister'
p9608
aS'personally it is my reading of vedic literature that educated me about the strong bond between humans and mother nature'
p9609
aS'we are all aware of mahatma gandhis doctrine of trusteeship'
p9610
aS'in this context i want to say that we the present generation have the responsibility to act as a trustee of the rich natural wealth for the future generations'
p9611
aS'the issue is not merely about climate change it is about climate justice'
p9612
aS'again i repeat is not the issue of climate change it is about climate justice'
p9613
aS'in my view the most adversely affected by climate change are the poor and the downtrodden'
p9614
aS'when a natural disaster strikes they are hit the hardest'
p9615
aS'when there are floods they are rendered homeless during a quake their homes are destroyed during droughts they are affected and during extreme cold too the homeless suffer the most'
p9616
aS'we cant let climate change keep affecting people in this manner'
p9617
aS'which is why i believe the discourse must shift focus from climate change to climate justice'
p9618
aS'the third theme promotion of dialogue calls for a shift from ideological approach to a philosophic one'
p9619
aS'without proper dialogue neither of the two themes of conflict avoidance is possible or workable'
p9620
aS'the severe limitations in our conflict resolution mechanisms are becoming more and more obvious'
p9621
aS'we need significant collective and strategic efforts to prevent bloodshed and violence'
p9622
aS'it is thus no surprise that the world is taking note of buddhism'
p9623
aS'this is also a recognition of the historical asian traditions and values which can be used to shift the paradigm to conflict avoidance to move from the path of ideology to philosophy'
p9624
aS'the essence of the entire concept of this conference including the first two themes conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness is contained in the dialogue part of it which calls for a shift from the them vs us ideological approach to philosophic approach'
p9625
aS'it is necessary to inform the world about the need to shift from ideology whether religious or secular to philosophy'
p9626
aS'when i spoke at the unite nations last year i briefly mentioned that the world needs toshift from ideological approach to philosophic approach'
p9627
aS'a day later when i addressed the council for foreign relations i expanded on this concept a little more'
p9628
aS'the essence of philosophy is that it is not a closed thought while ideology is a closed one'
p9629
aS'so philosophy not only allows dialogue but it is perpetual search of truth through dialogue'
p9630
aS'the entire upanishad literature is a compilation of dialogue'
p9631
aS'ideology only believes in unabated truth'
p9632
aS'so ideologies which close the gatesfor dialogue have the propensity for violence while philosophy seeks to avoid it though dialogue'
p9633
aS'thus hindu and buddhist religions are in that sense more philosophies and not just belief systems'
p9634
aS'it is my firm belief that the solution to all problems lies in dialogue'
p9635
aS'earlier it was believed that force indicates power'
p9636
aS'now power must come through the strength of ideas and the effective dialogue'
p9637
aS'we have seen the adverse effects of war'
p9638
aS'the first half of the 20th century was witness to the horrors of two world wars'
p9639
aS'now nature of warfare is changing and the dangers are increasing'
p9640
aS'what took a hundred thousand men or a prolonged battle can now happen through the click of a button in a span of minutes'
p9641
aS'all of us here have a cardinal duty to ensure that our future generations lead a life of peace dignity and mutual respect'
p9642
aS'we need to sow the seeds of a conflict-free world and in this endeavour faiths of buddhism and hinduism have a great contribution'
p9643
aS'when we talk about dialogue what kind of dialogue should it be'
p9644
aS'it is dialogue which produces no anger or retribution'
p9645
aS'one of the greatest examples of such dialogue was the one between adi sankara and mandana mishra'
p9646
aS'it is worth recalling and describing this ancient example for our modern times'
p9647
aS'adi sankara a vedantic who did not give high marks for rituals was a young man while mandana mishra was an elderly scholar and high ritualist who believed even in animal sacrifice'
p9648
aS'adi sankara wanted to establish through dialogue and debate with the highest authority on ritualism and that rituals were not necessary for attaining mukti while mandana mishra wanted to prove that sankara was wrong in dismissing rituals'
p9649
aS'this was how in ancient india debates on sensitive issues between scholars avoided such issues being settled in streets'
p9650
aS'adi sankara and mandana mishra held a debate and sankara won'
p9651
aS'but the more important point is not the debate itself but how was the debate was conducted'
p9652
aS'it is a fascinating story that will ever remain one of the highest forms of debate for all times for humanity'
p9653
aS'it was agreed that if mandana mishra lost he would cease to be a householder gruhasta and accept sanyasa'
p9654
aS'if adi sankara lost he would give up his sanyasa and marry and settle down as householder or in gruhasta life'
p9655
aS'mandana mishra a high scholar offered to adi sankara who was young and therefore mishra considered unequal to choose a referee of his choice'
p9656
aS'adi sankara chose mandana mishras wife a scholar herself as the referee'
p9657
aS'if mandana mishra lost she would lose her husband'
p9658
aS'but see what she did'
p9659
aS'she asked both sankar and mishra to wear fresh garlands and then begin the debate and said that the one whose garland loses its freshness would be declared as the loser'
p9660
aS'why'
p9661
aS'because if one gets angry the body will develop heat and as a result the garland flowers will lose their freshness in that heat'
p9662
aS'anger within is a sign of defeat'
p9663
aS'on this logic mandana mishra was declared as having lost the debate'
p9664
aS'and he accepted sanyas and became a disciple of sankara'
p9665
aS'this demonstrates the vitality of dialogue and that too dialogue without anger or conflict'
p9666
aS'today in this august gathering we are people of different nationalities with different lifestyles but what binds us is the fact that the roots of our civilisations are in our shared philosophies history and heritage'
p9667
aS'buddhism and buddhist heritage have been a uniting and binding factor'
p9668
aS'they say that this century is going to be an asian century'
p9669
aS'i am very clear that without embracing the path and ideals shown by gautam buddha this century can not be an asian century'
p9670
aS'i see lord buddha doing to our collective spiritual well-being what global trade did to our collective economic well-being and the digital internet did to our collective intellectual well-being'
p9671
aS'i see lord buddha in the 21st century across national borders across faith systems across political ideologies playing the role of a bridge to promote understanding to counsel patience and to enlighten us with tolerance and empathy'
p9672
aS'you are visiting a nation that is extremely proud of its buddhist heritage'
p9673
aS'my hometown of vadnagar in gujarat is one of the many sites where buddhist relics were found and was one of the places visited by chinese traveller and chronicler xuanzang'
p9674
aS'the saarc region is home to the holy sites of buddhism lumbini bodh gaya sarnath kushinagar'
p9675
aS'these sites draw pilgrims from asean nations as also from china korea japan mongolia and russia'
p9676
aS'my government is doing everything possible to give an impetus to this buddhist heritage across india and india is taking the lead in boosting the buddhist heritage across asia'
p9677
aS'this three-day meet is one such effort'
p9678
aS'i hope the next three days are full of vibrant and rich discussions and we are able to sit together and think about the way ahead towards peace conflict resolution and a clean and green world'
p9679
aS'i look forward to seeing you in bodh gaya the day after'

p9683
aS'i feel very blessed to be here at bodh gaya'
p9684
aS'after pandit jawaharlal nehru and atal bihari vajpayee i have the opportunity to visit this sacred place'
p9685
aS'i am meeting you all on a very special day'
p9686
aS'today we in india are observing teachers day to commemorate the birth anniversary of our 2nd president a great scholar and teacher dr'
p9687
aS'sarvepalli radhakrishnan'
p9688
aS'in this symposium we have been talking about one of the most impactful teachers in world history gautama buddha'
p9689
aS'his teachings have inspired millions of people over centuries'
p9690
aS'today we are also celebrating janmashtami the day lord krishna was born'
p9691
aS'the world has so much to learn from lord krishna'
p9692
aS'when we talk about lord krishna we say -shri krishna the teacher of all teachers the guru of all gurus'
p9693
aS'both gautama buddha and lord krishna have taught the world so much'
p9694
aS'the themes of this conference in a way are inspired by the values and ideals given by these two greats'
p9695
aS'shri krishna gave his message before the start of the great war in the mahabharata and lord buddha repeatedly emphasized on rising above warfare'
p9696
aS'the message by both of them was about establishing dharma'
p9697
aS'both of them gave great prominence to principles and processes'
p9698
aS'gautama buddha gave the eight-fold path and the panchsheel'
p9699
aS'while shri krishna gave invaluable lessons of life in the form of karma yoga'
p9700
aS'these two divine souls had the strength to bring people together rising above differences'
p9701
aS'their teachings are most practical eternal and are more relevant in this day and age than ever before'
p9702
aS'the place where we are meeting makes it even more special'
p9703
aS'we are meeting in bodh gaya a land that has a distinctive place in the history of humankind'
p9704
aS'this is the land of enlightenment'
p9705
aS'years ago what bodh gaya got was siddhartha but what bodh gaya gave to the world was lord buddha the epitome of knowledge peace and compassion'
p9706
aS'this is therefore the ideal venue for a dialogue and meeting here on the auspicious day of janmashtami and the special day of teachers day makes this unique'
p9707
aS'it was my great privilege to have participated in the inaugural function of the first international hindu buddhist initiative on conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness hosted by the vivekananda international foundation and tokyo foundation with the support of the international buddhist confederation at delhi day before yesterday'
p9708
aS'the conference was conceptualised on shifting the paradigm from conflict resolution to conflict avoidance and from environmental regulation to environmental consciousness'
p9709
aS'i had shared some of my thoughts on the two critical themes which are threatening humanity as no other challenge before'
p9710
aS'i recalled how in the context of both issues and for changing the global paradigm of thinking the world is looking to the buddha today as conflict resolution mechanisms and environmental regulations both of them dependent on the instrumentality of nation states are increasingly failing to measure up to challenges'
p9711
aS'spiritual and religious leaders and also intellectuals largely from buddhist societies participated in the two day conference and deliberated on the two issues'
p9712
aS'at the end of the two day conference and after a churning in which spiritual religious and intellectual leaders participated the tokyo foundation has announced that they have decided to hold a similar conference in january 2016'
p9713
aS'and other buddhist nations have also offered to hold similar conferences in theircountries'
p9714
aS'this is an extraordinary development which coincides with the rise of asia as an economic and civilisational phenomenon'
p9715
aS'the themes of the conference informed and shaped by the hindu-buddhist civilisational and cultural perspectives promise to deepen the notion of conflict avoidance philosophy and environmental consciousness in asia and beyond'
p9716
aS'the two day conference seems to have arrived at a broad consensus on both issues'
p9717
aS'on the issue of conflicts most of which are being driven by religious intolerance the participants in the conference seem to have agreed that while there is no problem about the freedom to practise ones religion it is when the radical elements try to force their own ideologies on others that the potential for conflict arises'
p9718
aS'on the issue of environment the conference seems to have agreedthat the philosophic underpinning of the dharma which stresses the protection of natural heritage is critical for sustainable development'
p9719
aS'i may add that the united nations too has arrived at the view that sustainable development is achievable only through aligning development to the local culture of the people'
p9720
aS'this in my view is a positive turn in the development modelling of the world of diversity'
p9721
aS'i may add that the turn in thinking at the global level has created the eco-system for the hindu-buddhist societies to carry forward their consensual ideas to the global fora'
p9722
aS'i personally consider the hindu buddhist conference on conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness as an important development in a world that seems to be short of durable ideas on both issues'
p9723
aS'hindu philosophy was one of the greatest beneficiaries of the advent and the teachings of the lord buddha'
p9724
aS'many scholars have analysed the impact of buddha on hinduism'
p9725
aS'in fact adi sankara was even critiqued for the way he was influenced by the buddha and sankara was called as prachhanna boudha meaning sankara was buddha in disguised form'
p9726
aS'that was the extent of influence of the buddha on adi sankara regarded by many as the tallest hindu philosopher'
p9727
aS'at the mass level buddha was so venerated that jayadeva in his geeta govinda even praised him as mahavishnu or god himself whodescended to preach ahimsa'
p9728
aS'so hinduism after the buddhas advent became buddhist hinduism or hindu buddhism'
p9729
aS'they are today an inseparable amalgam'
p9730
aS'this is how swami vivekananda praised buddha'
p9731
aS'i quote at the time buddha was born india was in need of a great spiritual leader a prophet'
p9732
aS'buddha never bowed down to anything neither veda nor caste nor priest nor custom'
p9733
aS'he fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him'
p9734
aS'such a fearless search for truth and such love for every living thing the world has never seen'
p9735
aS'buddha was more brave and sincere than any teacher'
p9736
aS'buddha was the first human being to give to this world a complete system of morality'
p9737
aS'he was good for goods sake he loved for loves sake'
p9738
aS'buddha was the great preacher of equality'
p9739
aS'every man and woman has the same right to attain spirituality that was his teaching'
p9740
aS'i would personally call india buddhist india as it has imbibed all the values and virtues of the teachings of buddha by their religious scholars incorporating them in their literature'
p9741
aS'when this highest tribute is paid by one of the great hindu philosophers would it be wrong to call todays hinduism in quality and substance as buddhist hinduism'
p9742
aS'buddha is the crown jewel of the indian nation which accepts all ways of worship of all religions'
p9743
aS'this quality of hinduism in india was a product of many great spiritual masters chief among them was buddha'
p9744
aS'and this is what sustains the secular character of india'
p9745
aS'the enlightenment which buddha attained in bodh gaya also lit the light of enlightenment in hinduism'
p9746
aS'as the first servant of this ancient nation i revere buddha as a reformer of not only hinduism but also the world who has given all of us a new world view and vision which is critical for the survival of all of us and the entire world'
p9747
aS'i recognise how buddhists all over the world revere bodh gaya as a place of pilgrimage'
p9748
aS'we in india would like to develop bodh gaya so that it can become the spiritual capital and civilisational bond between india and the buddhist world'
p9749
aS'the government of india would like to provide all possible support that its buddhist cousin nations need for the satisfaction of their spiritual needs from this holiest of holy places for them'
p9750
aS'i am happy to read the declaration of buddhist religions and spiritual leaders'
p9751
aS'this declaration is the result of hardwork and extensive dialogue which is why it is a pioneering document that will show us the way ahead'
p9752
aS'i also echo prime minister shinzo abe of japan who the other day highlighted the importance of tolerance appreciation of diversity and spirit of compassion and fraternity'
p9753
aS'his message to this august gathering and his continuous support forfurthering this initiative is a matter of great strength for us'
p9754
aS'once again my congratulations and best wishes to you all'
p9755
aS'this conference has raised a hope and urge to go beyond clash and create a dialogue framework for civilizational harmony and world peace'
p9756
aS'i wish you well in your constant and determined efforts to ensure that our wisdom reaches the future generations and that too in a manner in which they can practically relate to'
p9757
aS'this is essential not for us or them but for the progress of the entire human race and the beautiful surroundingswhich we have got from mother nature'
p9758

p9759

p9782
aS'we both want deeper economic engagement'
p9783
aS'we would like to see our trade grow and become more balanced for sri lanka'
p9784
aS'we discussed how we can achieve these goals in a more open and competitive indian market including through bilateral arrangements for trade and investments'
p9785

p9786
aS'i offered indias full support to strengthen connectivity between our two countries to deepen human and economic links that will benefit all sections of our societies'

aS'with president sirisena and prime minister wickremesinghe we can look to the future with great optimism'
p9803
aS'thank you'
p9804
aS'my dear countrymen greetings to you all'
p9805
aS'this is the twelfth episode of mann ki baat and in a way it means that we have completed one year'
p9806
aS'last year on 3rd october i had an opportunity to conduct my first ever mann ki baat'
p9807
aS'mann ki baat one year many thoughts'
p9808
aS'i am not sure of what you gained but i can certainly say that i gained a lot'
p9809
aS'in a democracy the power of the people is of great significance'
p9810
aS'this thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why i have immense faith in the power of the people'
p9811
aS'but with mann ki baat whatever i was taught whatever i was explained and the experiences i had made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking'
p9812
aS'our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual'
p9813
aS'my experience of mann ki baat mademe realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as i have myself experienced them'
p9814
aS'i asked for suggestions for mann ki baat and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them'
p9815
aS'but people continued to contribute actively in lakhs'
p9816
aS'this in itself is a great power'
p9817
aS'i did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that i wrote a letter to the pm or posted on mygov'
p9818
aS'in yet my suggestions were not accepted even once'
p9819
aS'yes'
p9820
aS'these lakhs of letters did teach me something more'
p9821
aS'i became aware of very minute problems associated with governance'
p9822
aS'i would like to congratulate akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people'
p9823
aS'they conducted programmes after that'
p9824
aS'they called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised'
p9825
aS'they tried to get certain problems resolved'
p9826
aS'the various departments of thegovernment analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters others to personal issues some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of'
p9827
aS'many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government'
p9828
aS'it is true the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom'
p9829
aS'who would have thought that the mann ki baat will become a source ofinformation'
p9830
aS'but this has happened'
p9831
aS'in the same way mann ki baat became a platform to express the power of society'
p9832
aS'i had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became'
p9833
aS'the whole world was amazed'
p9834
aS'lakhs of people perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters'
p9835
aS'what dignity did it lend to our daughters'
p9836
aS'anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughters confidence but also made a commitment to them'
p9837
aS'whosoever saw it realized that theywill now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters'
p9838
aS'this was a kind of a silent revolution'
p9839
aS'i had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens keeping in mind the tourism industry of india to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of incredible india so that i can also see them'
p9840
aS'people sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of india'
p9841
aS'neither the government of india nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage'
p9842
aS'all things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny'
p9843
aS'the peoplethemselves took the task forward'
p9844
aS'in october last year i did my first mann ki baat'
p9845
aS'in that edition i had mentioned about gandhi jayanti'
p9846
aS'i told people that we are celebrating gandhijis birth anniversary on 2nd october'
p9847
aS'there was a time when there was khadi for nation'
p9848
aS'isnt it the need of the hour that there be khadi for fashion'
p9849
aS'i requested the people to buy khadi and to do their bit'
p9850
aS'today i can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of khadi have almost doubled'
p9851
aS'now see there wasno government advertisement'
p9852
aS'nor were lakhs and crores spent'
p9853
aS'a simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change'
p9854
aS'once i had mentioned in mann ki baat about the problem of poor families how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit'
p9855
aS'shouldnt they be getting gas cylinders'
p9856
aS'and i had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy'
p9857
aS'just thinktoday i can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people'
p9858
aS'i saw on t'
p9859
aS'v a retired teacher a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy'
p9860
aS'thecommon people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy'
p9861
aS'but then they did give up their subsidy'
p9862
aS'isnt it a silent revolution'
p9863
aS'isnt it a demonstration of the peoples power'
p9864
aS'the governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration'
p9865
aS'there is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society'
p9866
aS'mann ki baat has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again i would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform'
p9867
aS'they took up everysmall cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country'
p9868
aS'can there be a bigger satisfaction than this'
p9869
aS'this time i thought of conducting a new experiment through mann ki baat'
p9870
aS'i had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded'
p9871
aS'i told them that i will take it up in mann ki baat'
p9872
aS'i am happy that we received more than 55000 calls from across the country be it siachen kutch or kamrup be it kashmir or kanyakumari'
p9873
aS'there is no part of india from which i did not receive a phone call'
p9874
aS'this is a pleasant experience in itself'
p9875
aS'people of all age groups have sent messages'
p9876
aS'i listened to some message personally and i liked them'
p9877
aS'my team is working on the others'
p9878
aS'you must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important'
p9879
aS'the entire government will work on your suggestions'
p9880
aS'but there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy'
p9881
aS'it feels as if there is negativity all around us'
p9882
aS'but my experience was different'
p9883
aS'these 55000 people expressed themselves in their own way'
p9884
aS'it was frank interaction where they could say anything but i am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of mann ki baat'
p9885
aS'they were totally positive suggestion oriented and constructive'
p9886
aS'just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude this is the nations greatest wealth'
p9887
aS'there were serious complaints in about 1-2 phone calls'
p9888
aS'but more than 90 things were energizing and pleasant'
p9889
aS'another thing came to my mind for the speciallyabled'
p9890
aS'and among them especially from the kin of visually impaired they made quite a number of phone calls'
p9891
aS'the reason may be that they are not able to watch t'
p9892
aS'v but they must definitely be listening to the radio'
p9893
aS'this made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people'
p9894
aS'i am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive'
p9895
aS'pawan acharya form alwar rajasthan has sent me a message'
p9896
aS'i believe that all of you should hear it and follow it'
p9897
aS'please hear what he wants to say-my name is pawan acharya and i belong to alwar rajasthan'
p9898
aS'i want to give the message to prime minister shri narendra modi ji to request all the people of india through his programme mann ki baat to use as much earthen lamps diya as they can this diwali'
p9899
aS'this will not only help the environment but will also provide employment to many potter families'
p9900
aS'thank you'
p9901
aS'pawan i believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of india'
p9902
aS'it is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless'
p9903
aS'so the earthen lamps will be valuable too'
p9904
aS'it is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor mans home'
p9905
aS'poor people earn their living this way'
p9906
aS'i request the citizens to follow pawans advice in the coming festivals'
p9907
aS'if we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor'
p9908
aS'my dear countrymen on the day of ganesh chaturthi i had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces'
p9909
aS'the jawans from our army navy and air force guarding our land waters and skies'
p9910
aS'we have completed 50 years of our war with pakistan in 1965'
p9911
aS'to commemorate this event an exhibition named shouryanjali had been organized near india gate'
p9912
aS'i saw it with immense interest'
p9913
aS'i went there for half an hour but when i came out it was more than 2'
p9914
aS'5 hours andi felt like seeing more'
p9915
aS'what was it that was not there'
p9916
aS'the entire history has been brought to life'
p9917
aS'from aesthetic perspective it was excellent from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this'
p9918
aS'at that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war those tales of valour and sacrifice of our greatsoldiers which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition'
p9919

aS'if you want to create history then itis necessary to understand the nuances of the past'
p9923
aS'history binds us to our roots'
p9924
aS'if we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end'
p9925
aS'this exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past'

p9933
aS'look at the power of democracy a young kid has ordered the prime minister although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry'
p9934
aS'i do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought not only should the prime minister think about what he said but every indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say prime minister modi ji i want to tell you that for the swachhta abhiyan cleaniness drive that you started you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner'
p9935
aS'this child is absolutely right'
p9936
aS'we should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness'
p9937
aS'i got great satisfaction from this childs message'
p9938
aS'on the 2nd of october i declared this cleanliness drive and i think something like this has happened for the first time after independence because even in the parliament cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days'
p9939
aS'our government is criticized as well'
p9940
aS'i even have to listen to a lot of things people saythings like modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness but what really happened'
p9941
aS'i dont get offended by all this'
p9942
aS'i look at the positive side of it which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in india'
p9943
aS'look at the other side on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country both are talking about cleanliness a country can not be more fortunate than this'
p9944
aS'this ongoing movement of thoughts the environment thats building against filth there has been an awareness towards cleanliness'
p9945
aS'this will also compel the governments to work'
p9946
aS'the self-governing regional bodies be it panchayats municipal corporations municipalities municipal corporations ofmetropolitan cities central government or state government everybody will have to work on this'
p9947
aS'we will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in india in 2019 when we celebrate the 150th birthday of mahatma gandhi we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream'
p9948
aS'do you know what mahatma gandhi used to say'
p9949
aS'he once said if i have to choose between freedom and cleanliness i will choose cleanliness first and freedom later'
p9950
aS'cleanliness was more important for gandhi than freedom'
p9951
aS'come let us all follow what mahatma gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish'
p9952
aS'mr gulshan arora from delhi has left a message on mygov'
p9953
aS'he has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of dindayal ji'
p9954
aS'my dear fellow citizens the lives of great men will always inspire us'
p9955
aS'it is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men'

p9959
aS'you pick any date you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history'

p9963
aS'i had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing all kinds of fabric a lot of things but you must also own khadi'
p9964
aS'i am saying it again that khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd october onwards for one whole month'
p9965
aS'you must all avail this sale'
p9966
aS'along with khadi handloom must also be given equal importance'
p9967
aS'our weavers put in a lot of hard work'
p9968
aS'if we 1'
p9969
aS'5 billion indians buy a handloom product or khadi for even rs'
p9970
aS'5 10 or rs'
p9971
aS'50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver'
p9972
aS'it will reach the poor widow who weaves khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for khadi at our homes and on our bodies this diwali'
p9973
aS'i just have this small request i do not insist that you only wear khadi'
p9974
aS'but have a few collection'
p9975
aS'this is my only request'
p9976
aS'look last year we almost doubled thekhadi sale'
p9977
aS'a lot of the poor have been benefitted'
p9978
aS'advertisements worth crores by the government can not achieve what has been achieved through your help'

aS'this is the power of the masses and this is why i request you to come forward and help once again'
p9980
aS'dear countrymen my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing'
p9981
aS'i wish to share this joy with you as well'

aS'i visited kolkata in the month of may and the family members of subhash chandra bose came to meet me'
p9983
aS'his nephew chandra bose had organized everything'
p9984
aS'i got the opportunity to spend quality time with subhash babus family members'
p9985
aS'that day i decided to invite his great family to the prime ministers residence'
p9986
aS'mr chandra bose and his family members were in theprocess of organising this and last week i received the confirmation that around 50 members of the bose family are coming to the prime ministers residence for a meeting'
p9987
aS'you can imagine how happy i must have been on hearing this news'
p9988
aS'netajis family members probably must have been invited together to the prime ministers residence for the first time'

p9994
aS'my name is bhargavi kande'
p9995
aS'i want to request the prime minister to make the young generation aware about voters registration which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government'
p9996
aS'thank youbhargavi talked about registering the names in the voters list and the voting process'
p9997
aS'in a democracy every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually'
p9998
aS'the voting percentage is also increasing and for this i want to congratulate the election commission of india'
p9999
aS'up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years'
p10000
aS'today our election commission does not workonly as a regulator but has become a facilitator has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies'
p10001
aS'it is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do'
p10002
aS'we must mobilize schools colleges and societies we must spread awareness always not only during the time of elections'
p10003
aS'the voters list must be updated we must also keep a watch on it'
p10004
aS'this priceless right that i have is it safe'
p10005
aS'am i using it or not'
p10006
aS'we must alldevelop this habit'
p10007
aS'i hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voters list yet get themselves registered and must vote too'
p10008
aS'i publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food'
p10009
aS'this is a holy act everyone must do it'
p10010
aS'i have returned from a visit to kashi day before yesterday'
p10011
aS'i met a lot of people and attended a lot of events'
p10012
aS'i met many people there but these two kids i met have told me something that i want to share with you today'
p10013
aS'one of the boys kshitij is a student of class 7'
p10014
aS'he studies in the kendriya vidyalaya of banaras hindu university'
p10015
aS'he is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level'
p10016
aS'at such a young age i saw that he was interested in research in the fieldof physics'
p10017
aS'i thought he must be reading a lot books must be surfing internet must be watching new experiments'
p10018
aS'he was talking about things like how to stop railway accidents which technology to use how to save money in producing energy how to develop feelings in robots and what not'
p10019
aS'he was an amazing kid'
p10020
aS'although i could not follow what he was saying very closely but i liked his confidence and his interest in so many things'
p10021
aS'i want that kids in our country should developmore and more interest in science'
p10022
aS'kids should be very inquisitive why'
p10023
aS'how'

p10028
aS'she is the daughter of sadavrat patel a resident of sundarpur varanasi'
p10029
aS'her family is very poor'
p10030
aS'i was surprised that the girl had memorized the bhagvada geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its english interpretation and its definition in english as well as hindi'
p10031
aS'when i asked her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was onlyfive years old'
p10032
aS'i asked where she learned it from'
p10033
aS'they said we do not have any idea'
p10034
aS'then i asked if she only reads geetha or does she read something else as well'
p10035
aS'her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once she has everything memorized by the evening'
p10036
aS'if she picks history she knows everything by the evening'
p10037
aS'he told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has'
p10038
aS'i was really very impressed'
p10039
aS'sometimes kids become obsessedwith celebrities sonam did not have any such obsessions'
p10040
aS'i felt this girl is god-gifted'
p10041
aS'meeting these kids was a very special experience that i had on my kashi visit'
p10042
aS'so i thought i must share it with you'
p10043
aS'we do a lot of things other than what you see on the tv and read in the newspapers'
p10044
aS'sometimes we enjoy doing these things as well'
p10045
aS'similarly i will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids'
p10046
aS'i noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in mann ki baat'
p10047
aS'look what sandeep from haryana has to say sir i want you to do mann ki baat a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words'
p10048
aS'sandeep ji what all will you make me do'
p10049
aS'i have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme have to make adjustments to my time-table'

p10053
aS'for now we will stick to the one month program only'
p10054
aS'mann ki baat in a way has completed a year'
p10055
aS'do you know how much did subhash babu use the radio'
p10056

aS'i want to especially thank prime minister abe who has just arrived in new york'
p10073
aS'the subject of reforms in the united nations security council has been the focus of global attention for decades unfortunately without progress so far'
p10074
aS'our group of four countries g-4 came together in 2004 bound by our shared commitment to global peace and prosperity our faith in multilateralism and our willingness to assume our global responsibilities that the world expects from us'
p10075
aS'i am delighted that we are meeting again as heads of government after ten years'
p10076
aS'as i had reflected in my letter on the 70th anniversary of the united nations we live in a fundamentally different world from the time the un was born'
p10077
aS'the number of member states has grown four-fold'
p10078
aS'threats to peace and security have become more complex unpredictable and undefined'
p10079
aS'in many ways our lives are becoming globalized but fault-lines around our identities are growing'
p10080
aS'we live in a digital age'
p10081
aS'the global economy is changed with new engines of growth more widely dispersed economic power and widening wealth gap'
p10082
aS'trends in demography urbanization and migrations are posing new challenges'
p10083
aS'climate change and terrorism are new concerns'
p10084
aS'cyber and space are entirely new frontiers of opportunities and challenges'
p10085
aS'yet our institutions approaches and often mindsets reflect the wisdom of the century we have left behind not the century we live in'
p10086
aS'this is especially true of the united nations security council'
p10087
aS'the reform of the security council within a fixed time frame has become an urgent and important task'
p10088
aS'the security council must include the worlds largest democracies major locomotives of the global economy and voices from all the major continents'
p10089
aS'it will carry greater credibility and legitimacy and will be more representative and effective in addressing the challenges of the 21st century'
p10090
aS'after decades we finally see some movement'
p10091
aS'the 69th session of the general assembly has taken a significant step forward to commence text-based negotiations'
p10092

p10093
ag1875
aS'mr sam kutesa and ambassador courtney rattray'

aS'it is a great pleasure to be here'
p10104
aS'for me this is a special event because the idea of startups is close to my heart'
p10105
aS'you are likely to wonder why because governments and national capitals are supposed to stop or slow things down not start them up'
p10106
aS'i know this was once the view of washington from silicon valley and this is exactly how tech specialists in bengaluru thought about new delhi'
p10107
aS'and i know that many of you think that the only problems that have not been solved are the ones for which you have not written the apps yet'
p10108
aS'when i shifted to delhi last year i thought of my government as a startup'
p10109
aS'so i also saw some of the bumps you face on the road'
p10110
aS'i understand your challenges but also the wonderful feeling of creating something new'
p10111
aS'the course of human history and progress has been shaped by imagination inspiration invention and innovation'
p10112
aS'i often say if theres a strong wind blowing some might want to shut the window'
p10113
aS'others will want to put up a windmill or launch their sails on the seas'
p10114
aS'the difference between perception of something as a challenge or an opportunity is the difference between inertia and initiative status quo and progress'
p10115
aS'the idea of start ups is as ancient as this world'
p10116
aS'each economic age has been defined by disruption of the previous one by the evolution of ideas and products that displace the old ones'
p10117
aS'start ups have always been the engine of progress'
p10118
aS'the mega corporations of today were startsup of yesterday'
p10119
aS'what is different now is that the digital age has created a fertile new environment for startups'
p10120
aS'this is a world in which you dont grow by extracting resources but by spreading an idea'
p10121
aS'more than the creator it is the consumer who discovers applications'
p10122
aS'today the startups defy the natural rates of growth'
p10123
aS'an idea can become a global name within a year'
p10124
aS'customers can multiply at the rate of millions employees at the rate of thousands and valuation at the rate of billions'
p10125
aS'the convergence of technology integration across diverse fields distributed architecture and people willing to back an idea have opened a new world for enterprise'
p10126
aS'this ecosystem was born in the silicon valley'
p10127
aS'no community is shaping our world as much as the one on this californian coast'
p10128
aS'it isnt just big names but small firms that are fashioning every day new ways to enrich human life with the joy of artists and creators'
p10129
aS'that underlines americas success and inspires the world'
p10130
aS'so i see startups technology and innovation as exciting and effective instruments for indias transformation and for creating jobs for our youth'
p10131
aS'we are a nation of 800 million youth below the age of 35 years'
p10132
aS'they are eager for change have the energy and drive to pursue it and the confidence to achieve it'
p10133
aS'when each of the five hundred odd towns produces ten startups and each of our six hundred thousand villages produce six small businesses on a regular basis we will create an enormous economic momentum and generate a huge number of jobs in our country'
p10134
aS'indias own ecosystem of startups is evolving rapidly'

p10151
aS'from creating infrastructure to providing services from manufacture of products to human resource development from supporting governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy digital india is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you'
p10152

p10154
aS'we have here today our department of space that provides free data on its portal'

p10157
aS'but it is not just about the opportunities generated on the digital platform and advanced science by urban enterprises'
p10158
aS'i want to see the idea and the spirit of startups light up the economies and the fortunes of people in rural india'

aS'president barack obama secretary general ban ki-moon excellencies the foundations of the united nations were laid by the brave soldiers on the battlefields of second world war'
p10253
aS'by 1945 they included 2'
p10254
aS'5 million men of the indian army the largest volunteer force in history'
p10255
aS'more than 24000 lost their lives and nearly half of that went missing'
p10256
aS'the legacy of that sacrifice is shared by three countries present here'
p10257
aS'they remain today among the largest contributors to the united nations peacekeeping operations'
p10258
aS'over 180000 indian troops have participated in un peacekeeping missions - more than from any other country'

aS'i thank president obama for hosting this summit on peacekeeping'
p10265
aS'it is timely not just because of the 70th anniversary of the organization'
p10266
aS'it is also because the security environment is changing the demands on peacekeeping are growing and the resources are harder to find'
p10267
aS'todays peacekeepers are called upon not only to maintain peace and security but also address a range of complex challenges'
p10268
aS'mandates are ambitious but resources are often inadequate'
p10269
aS'mandates sometimes make peacekeepers party to conflicts putting at risk their lives and success of their missions'
p10270
aS'the problems arise to a large extent because troop contributing countries do not have a role in the decision-making process'
p10271
aS'they do not have adequate representation in senior management and as force commanders'
p10272
aS'peacekeeping missions should be deployed prudently with full recognition of their limitations and in support of political solutions'
p10273
aS'we are pleased that the high-level independent panel on peace operations has recognized these issues'
p10274
aS'we thank un secretary general for his prompt report on the panels recommendations'

p10279
aS'in conclusion l wish to emphasise that the success of un peacekeeping ultimately depends not on the weapons that the soldiers carry but on the moral force that decisions of the un security council command'
p10280
aS'we must complete the long-pending task of reforms within a fixed time frame of the un security council to preserve the relevance and effectiveness of the un'
p10281

p10334
aS'i fondly recall my visit to the city of hannover and hannover messe in april'
p10335
aS'15 states a number of ceos and hundreds of companies from india had participated'
p10336
aS'the exposure to hannover messe will go a long way in shaping our vision and strategy of manufacturing'
p10337
aS'this is particularly important at a time when we are on the path of making india a global manufacturing hub'
p10338
aS'dr'
p10339
aS'merkel and friends'
p10340
aS'there is tremendous potential in india-germany economic collaboration'
p10341
aS'germany ranks 7th among foreign investor countries in india'
p10342
aS'about 600 indo-german joint ventures are already operating in india'
p10343
aS'however as of now our economic partnership remains below our full potential'
p10344
aS'we are particularly keen to develop the sectors where germany is strong'
p10345
aS'we are working hard to create conducive conditions for the same'
p10346
aS'friends'
p10347
aS'at a time of global slowdown india represents a bright spot for investments'
p10348
aS'we are fortunate to be sailing in the right direction'
p10349
aS'the recent data on global economic activity reinforces this assertion'
p10350
aS'however we can not afford to be complacent'
p10351
aS'we are committed to doing everything possible to convert these analyses into reality'
p10352
aS'with a very open and global mindset we have worked aggressively in the last fifteen months to make india an easy place to do business'
p10353
aS'we are committed to creating favorable conditions for business and industry because we believe that they are necessary for improving the lives of ordinary citizens in india'
p10354
aS'a recent study conducted with the help of the world bank group has brought out the urgency among our provincial governments on ease of doing business'
p10355
aS'they are movinghand-in-hand with the federal government in this direction in a true spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism'
p10356
aS'in fact the provincial governments have now entered into a healthy competition among themselves to ensure that a transparent predictable and user friendly regulatory mechanism is quickly put in place'
p10357
aS'friends'
p10358
aS'one of the biggest challenges in india today is to productively employ our youth'
p10359
aS'for meeting this challenge we need to provide a huge push to manufacturing which has stagnated at around 16 of the gdp for several decades in india'
p10360
aS'this percentage must reach around 25 in the short and medium term'
p10361
aS'with this in view we have launched the make in india initiative'
p10362
aS'to make it a success apart from vigorous implementation of measures for ease of doing business we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure'
p10363
aS'transparent auction and allocation of spectrum and of key natural resources like coal iron ore and other minerals in the last 15 months have created a level playing field for investors'
p10364
aS'we are aware that our domestic financial resources are not sufficient to meet our needs'
p10365
aS'therefore to enhance the flow of foreign investments we have liberalized the fdi regime allowing 100 fdi in railways and enhancing the fdi limit to 49 in defence and insurance'
p10366
aS'we have also refined our fdi policy for construction and medical devices'
p10367
aS'we have rationalized a number of other fdi related policy issues including bringing in the concept of composite sector caps for thefpis and other investors'
p10368
aS'we are keen to build futuristic physical and social infrastructure'
p10369
aS'through self-imposed discipline in the management of our financial resources we have been able to allocate more resources for infrastructure sectors'
p10370
aS'in addition we are setting up an india investment and infrastructure fund'
p10371
aS'we have targeted an annual flow of rs 20000 crore which is approximately 2'
p10372
aS'7 billion euros into this fund from our own resources'
p10373
aS'we are putting in place a professional team for assetmanagement'
p10374
aS'we have also come up with the mechanism of tax free infrastructure bonds for projects in rail road and irrigation sectors'
p10375
aS'there were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on the sentiments of foreign investors'
p10376
aS'we have taken very decisive steps to remove a number of long pending concerns of investors'
p10377
aS'to give you some examples - we have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance - across the board we have increased the validity period of industrial licences - we have de-licenced a number of defence items and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate- we have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years - we have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and reinforced this position by not going for imposition of minimum alternate tax on fpis - we have notified the regulations for the alternative investment funds allowing foreign investments in such funds - we have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for real estate investment trusts - we have modified the permanent establishment norms - we have also decided to defer the implementation of the general anti-avoidance rules for two years - we have introduced the gst bill in parliament we are hopeful to roll it out in 2016 - we are working on a new bankruptcy code the company law tribunal is soon going to be formed'
p10378
aS'we want to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable'
p10379
aS'we are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters'
p10380
aS'as a result of our initiatives the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive'
p10381
aS'the growth rate of our gdp is above 7'
p10382
aS'fdi inflows have gone up by 40 compared with previous years corresponding period'
p10383
aS'many international financial institutions including the world bank imf oecd and others are predicting even faster growth in the coming years'
p10384
aS'moodys have upgraded the rating of india as positive'
p10385
aS'india has improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness'
p10386
aS'against 15th so far now we are at 9th place'
p10387
aS'india has also jumped 16 places on the world economic forums global competitive index after five years of decline in the list'
p10388
aS'similarly in a ranking of the top global destinations for greenfield investment in the first half of 2015 india is at number one'
p10389
aS'foreign policy magazine of usa has ranked india as number one fdi destination'
p10390
aS'thus just in fifteen months we have successfully restored the credibility of india in the eyes of global players'
p10391
aS'i have always said that government has no business to do business'
p10392
aS'hence through ppp or otherwise we are encouraging private investments in areas where earlier only government used to invest'
p10393
aS'we are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises to instill market discipline'
p10394
aS'friends'
p10395
aS'i want to assure you that india is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of all innovators and entrepreneurs'
p10396
aS'we have taken several initiatives for transparency and online processing in ip administration'
p10397
aS'a comprehensive national ipr policy is being finalized'
p10398
aS'last week i myself reviewed the situation'
p10399
aS'i can say that this will be a progressive and forward looking policy'
p10400
aS'friends'
p10401
aS'we want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality'
p10402
aS'our commitment and aggressiveness to achieve the goal in a faster and effective manner offers immense opportunities to german companies'
p10403
aS'these opportunities range from building 50 million houses to setting up 100 smart cities modernization of our railway network and stations to setting up of new railway corridors generation of 175 gw of renewable energy to construction of transmission anddistribution networks national highways bridges and metro rails'
p10404
aS'such a huge potential for creation and production will not be available in any one country'
p10405
aS'more importantly no one place on the earth can offer the potential for consumption on such a massive scale'
p10406
aS'we are trying to power this potential through our campaigns like digital india and skill india'
p10407
aS'to tap the energy fully we have launched the start up india campaign'
p10408
aS'i thank nasscom for becoming our active partner in this journey'
p10409
aS'recently we tried to ignite this energy through an interface of our youth with the eco-system of silicon valley'
p10410
aS'india in fact is on the threshold of a big it revolution'
p10411
aS'we are at the tipping point where technology is going to be leveraged to meet the aspirations of our 1'
p10412
aS'25 billion citizens'
p10413
aS'these initiatives provide additional avenues for investment in modern technology and human resources'
p10414
aS'friends'
p10415
aS'ours is a country of the young and it is going to remain so for many more years'
p10416
aS'there is a huge domestic market in india'
p10417
aS'unlike a decade ago talented young minds in india are no longer looking merely for high paying jobs'
p10418
aS'instead they have now begun taking risks and preferring to become entrepreneurs'
p10419
aS'we have witnessed exponential growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past'
p10420
aS'some of these have begun to challenge established global players'
p10421
aS'to conclude i can assure you that we will be open to welcome your ideas innovations and enterprises'
p10422
aS'i had said in hannover and i am saying it again that we are also open to carry out necessary corrections in our policies and procedures'
p10423
aS'i can say that never before india was so well prepared to absorb talent technology and investment from outside'
p10424
aS'to our understanding the necessary conditions to propel the indian economy to a high growth trajectory do exist today'
p10425
aS'i am eagerly looking forward to working with you'
p10426
aS'while in bengaluru i must add that it is the software of india that will move the hardware across the world it is the talent of india that will master the technology it is the market of india that will motivate manufacturing'
p10427
aS'therefore it makes strong business sense to be in india'
p10428
aS'it makes even better business sense to make in india'
p10429
aS'thank you very much'
p10430
aS'a very warm welcome to all of you'
p10431
aS'some of you have probably had the opportunity of visiting india before and for some probably it is the first time that you are visiting india'
p10432
aS'i hope that for your comfort you have been well looked after here'
p10433
aS'i know that there is an official programme but if you have any suggestion of what you would like to do here in addition to the programme that has been set up for you that can be accommodated'
p10434
aS'i also want that your visit here is not only important in the context of the india-africa forum summit but the very fact that it is a visit to india it is important and there will be full efforts on the part of my government'
p10435
aS'i feel that this india-africa forum summit is very important from many points of view'
p10436
aS'of course for india it is very important given that we are the host country but this is the first summit where all the 54 countries of africa have been invited and all the 54 countries are participating'
p10437
aS'in that sense the india-africa forum summit is the biggest event of its sort and partnership at this scale'
p10438
aS'till now as per the information that we have received 40 countries will be represented at the head of state head of government level the rest are being represented by senior ministers'
p10439
aS'this time in association with the india-africa forum summit there is also the conference of trade ministers because we would want that in the days and months and years to come the economic relations between india and africa should be further strengthened'
p10440
aS'the india-africa forum summits have had two summits earlier in 2008 and 2011 and now this is the 3rd india-africa forum summit taking place'
p10441
aS'earlier the two summits were organised on the basis of the banjul formula and in that sense very limited countries had come and participated'
p10442
aS'but this time we decided to in fact come out of this formula and ensure that there was participation from all countries of africa'
p10443
aS'this i think is going to take relations between india and africa to new heights'
p10444
aS'i think it is this partnership and this equality that is being given to all the countries'
p10445
aS'this is an initiative on our part and i think this is what makes this summit different from the two earlier versions'
p10446
aS'there are going to be meetings at various levels at the top level'
p10447
aS'i think it is this partnership with all which is going to bring a new freshness in every corner of africa'
p10448
aS'this new freshness is not just for africa but also for india that this summit is going to bring new freshness in our relations'
p10449
aS'i have been told that of course you have come to india and you are going to have a week-long programme during which you will be taken to various parts of the country and you will be seeing for yourself the progress and development'
p10450
aS'but in addition to you there are 400 journalists who are coming to cover this event from africa and they are coming on their own with their own means'
p10451
aS'i think this itself indicates the importance that is being attached to this summit'
p10452
aS'from the discussions that i have been having with everyone this summit in fact is attracting the focus of the entire world and people are in fact looking at it with great importance and i see this as a very good sign'
p10453
aS'the relations between india and the countries of africa these relations and these bonds that we have are not just political and economic but we also have a very rich cultural tradition'
p10454
aS'it is said that millions of years ago in fact the two parts of the earth were one piece and it was only much later that they became two separate pieces of land one was asia and the other was africa and we have an ocean which divides us'
p10455
aS'the west coast of india and the east coast of africa in fact are linked by the sea'
p10456
aS'i hail from the west coast of india from the state of gujarat'
p10457
aS'it was in fact the gujaratis who started trade and commerce with africa and maritime relations earlier on'
p10458
aS'even today there are 270000 indians who live in africa and many of them are gujaratis'
p10459
aS'in fact i too have had my links with africa not only when i was the chief minister of gujarat but even before that'
p10460
aS'i have always had relations with the african continent and whenever guests came they always met me'
p10461
aS'i have always had very good relations with various personalities of africa'
p10462
aS'so from a personal point of view i have always had very close links with this region'
p10463
aS'in fact there are many similarities between india and africa and together india and africa we represent one third of the worlds population'
p10464
aS'the population of india equals in fact the population of the entire african continent'
p10465
aS'africa in fact represents the youngest region in the world and india too is the youngest country'
p10466
aS'perhaps when we look at the world today these are the only two places where 65 per cent of the population is below 35 years of age and i feel that this is a matter of great fortune for both africa and for india'
p10467
aS'the bilateral trade between india and africa has been growing very rapidly and in the past few years it has grown by eight to nine times'
p10468
aS'i feel that after this summit it is going to see another major jump'
p10469
aS'india also is a major investor in africa today and this is especially so in the oil sector and this is giving a new dynamism to the african economy'
p10470
aS'following the two previous india-africa forum summits india has given to the tune of 7'
p10471
aS'4 billion dollars of concessional credit and this has been used to enhance in the fields of infrastructure agriculture industry energy and water'
p10472
aS'in more than 40 countries today there are more than 100 projects which are under implementation'
p10473
aS'in the same vein india has invested 1'
p10474
aS'2 billion dollars in more than 100 institutes and this is contributing in a major way to human resource development'
p10475
aS'for me i think the point which makes me the most happy is that there is this partnership between india and africa that is human resource development the capacity building'
p10476
aS'and in the last few years we have had the good fortune of imparting education and training to around 25000 african students and i think this is a matter of good fortune for india'
p10477
aS'today in africa many of the leaders who are now in power and in top position have had their education and training in india'
p10478
aS'i think between india and africa there is another aspect that links us with many countries in africa and that is solar power from which many african countries are benefiting'
p10479
aS'i think this is going to become a very strong community of nations and in the times to come the problem of climate change that the world is trying to counter and fight we are going to be playing a very major role in mitigation and lessening the effects of climate change'
p10480
aS'i think both india and africa can feel proud of the fact that today the world is facing the problem of climate change of the concerns regarding global warming i think both india and africa have had a tradition and it is in their culture not to pollute or not to damage the environment and we have perhaps sinned the less and contributed the minimum to this big problem to the world'
p10481
aS'i think this also is a common factor between india and africa'
p10482
aS'i am convinced that during this summit and following the summit we are going to have very important decisions which will give both india and africa a new sense of self confidence our relations are going to become closer and deeper and together i think we can lay the foundations of what we can contribute to the world'
p10483

p10505
aS'firstly these girls have created an image of mother india by thumb prints on a huge piece of cloth'
p10506
aS'they have sent me the image of mother india'
p10507
aS'initially i was surprised to see why they created a map of india using thumb prints'
p10508
aS'but when i read their letter i realized how beautifully a symbolic message was given'
p10509
aS'it is not as if these girls have tried to just awaken the prime minister alone'
p10510
aS'they are trying to create awareness among the people in their region and their mission is organ donation'
p10511
aS'they are organizing a public awareness campaign for organ donation'

p10522
aS'the country needs more than 2'
p10523
aS'5 lakh kidneys hearts and livers for donation per year'
p10524
aS'however in a country with 125 crore people only 5000 transplants could take place'
p10525
aS'each year about one lakh eyes are in need of a vision'
p10526
aS'and we are able to reach upto only 25000 people who need it'
p10527
aS'it implies that we are able to provide eye transplant services to only one out of the four needy persons'
p10528
aS'we should also know that if someone is killed in a road accident then also the organs can be donated'
p10529
aS'there are some legal hassles involved'
p10530
aS'and efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction'

aS'many new and encouraging things came to our attention'
p10595
aS'i would like to bring to your attention a few things'
p10596
aS'jharkhand a huge state is primarily tribal'
p10597
aS'unfortunately whenever one talks of jharkhand what comes to mind is maoism violence guns and blood soaked land'
p10598
aS'many regions in the state have been ruined by these communist terrorists'
p10599
aS'but the mp from that place a senior member who has also been our deputy speaker shri karia munda has dedicated his life for the tribals'
p10600
aS'he chose parsi gram panchayat from khunti district to be adopted for adarsh gram'
p10601
aS'it is difficult for government officials to go to places ruled by the maoists'
p10602
aS'even the doctors can not visit those places'
p10603
aS'he himself started travelling to this village to instill faith and give a new lease of life to governmental organizations'
p10604
aS'he encouraged the officials to visit'
p10605
aS'he tried to change the mood of despondency and create a mood to achieve something'
p10606
aS'a successful effort has been made in parsi village to create awareness along with infrastructure and organizational development'
p10607
aS'i would like to congratulate our honourable parliamentarian sri karia munda ji for the same'
p10608
aS'i got similar information from andhra too'
p10609
aS'the mp from andhra sri ashok gajapati raju became involved in this plan and chose dwarapudi gram panchayat from vijaynagram district for the same'
p10610
aS'other arrangements are in progress but he did something really innovative'
p10611
aS'he gave a task to the students in the village school'
p10612
aS'the new generation in the village is fortunate to be educated but the older generation is not literate'
p10613
aS'so he asked the students of a higher age group to educate the parents'
p10614
aS'so in the morning they are students and by evening they become educators'
p10615
aS'and so nearly 550 adults were taught by these children and made literate'
p10616
aS'just see no budget no circular no special arrangements but just will power brought about such a big change'
p10617
aS'this is amply demonstrated by the dwarapudi gram panchayat'

aS'i congratulate ruwala ji for his efforts to make this village not only an adarsh gram but self dependent village too'
p10628
aS'my dear brothers and sisters it is not possible that there be an episode of mann ki baat and we do not discuss cleanliness'
p10629
aS'savita rai from mumbai has sent me a telephonic message - each year on diwali we clean our houses'
p10630
aS'this diwali let us clean our environment along with our homes and maintain that cleanliness even after diwali'
p10631
aS'she has drawn attention to this issue'
p10632
aS'i want to remind you my dear countrymen that last year in our country the media ran a special campaign and showed all the places where crackers were lying and told that it was not the right thing'
p10633
aS'this was an awareness campaign launched by the media'
p10634
aS'as a result of it soon after diwali a cleanliness drive got initiated all by itself'
p10635
aS'so what you are saying is true that our concern before and after the festival should be the same'
p10636
aS'and we should express this concern on every public platform'
p10637
aS'and today i especially congratulate all the members of the indian media fraternity'
p10638

p10641
aS'there are so many places in our country that have been kept so clean'
p10642
aS'all these things were brought to light and i offered my heartfelt appreciation to india today group for their commendable efforts'
p10643
aS'since the inception of the cleanliness drive i have seen that from andhra and telangana etv eanadu have participated whole heartedly and specially sri ramoji rao who is very aged but beats any youth in his enthusiasm'
p10644
aS'he has made cleanliness his personal program his mission'
p10645

p10654
aS'thousands of channels and newspapers in our country i am unable to name them all due to time constraints but they all have helped run this campaign'
p10655
aS'this is why savita rai ji the suggestion that you have given us the whole nation has taken it upon them to do this work and taking it forward'
p10656
aS'the governor of meghalaya mr shanmuganthan wrote me a letter and talked about a village in meghalaya called mavalyannong'
p10657
aS'he has written that from last many years this village has set out on a mission for cleanliness and more or less every generation is completely dedicated towards this cause'
p10658
aS'he has also mentioned that a few years ago they also got the award for the cleanest village of asia'
p10659
aS'the idea of a far-flung village situated in the north-eastern region in meghalaya which has been particular about cleanliness since years makes me extremely happy'
p10660
aS'this has become the habit and the culture of the village'
p10661
aS'this is what reinforces our belief that our nation will be clean one day for sure'
p10662
aS'this will be possible because of the efforts of the people and by the time we celebrate the 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi the 125 crore people of the country should be able to proudly proclaim that we have made india clean'
p10663
aS'my dear countrymen i said this from the red fort on the 15th of august that there are few places where corruption is deep rooted'
p10664
aS'when a poor man goes for an ordinary job he faces so many problems to get a decent reference and has to go through a team of agents who take money from him in exchange for the position he is applying for'
p10665
aS'he loses money whether he gets the job or not'
p10666
aS'we keep hearing things like these and this is when i had an idea why do we need to interview people for ordinary jobs'
p10667
aS'i have never heard of any psychologist in the world who can analyze a person completely in a 1-2 minute long interview'
p10668
aS'with this thought i decided to do away with the tradition of interviews for small positions'
p10669
aS'my dear young friends i feel very proud to tell you all that the government has completed all the formalities and now there will not be any interview for the non-gazetted posts of group d group c and group b in the central government'
p10670
aS'this will come into effect from january 1st 2016'
p10671
aS'we will not interrupt the ongoing procedures now but from january 1st 2016 this will come into play'
p10672
aS'so let me congratulate all my young friends for the same'
p10673
aS'we had anyways declared an important scheme in the last budget'
p10674
aS'in our country gold has become a part of our social life'
p10675
aS'gold is considered the medium of financial security'
p10676
aS'gold is considered to be the solution for difficult times'
p10677
aS'this has been an age old tradition'
p10678
aS'i dont believe that anyone can reduce this love for gold that we have developed but keeping gold as dead-money does not suit todays generation'
p10679
aS'gold can become our strength'
p10680
aS'it can become our financial strength'
p10681
aS'gold can become the financial property of the nation and every indian must contribute to this'
p10682
aS'i am happy that the promise that we made of introducing important schemes we will do so around diwali and dhanteras when people buy specially buy gold'
p10683
aS'we have introduced a gold monetization scheme'
p10684
aS'under this scheme you can deposit your gold in a bank and the bank will give you interest same as you deposit your money and get interest from the bank'
p10685
aS'earlier we used to keep our gold in the lockers and paid for the lockers ourselves'
p10686
aS'now when you keep your gold in the bank the bank will give you money as interest'
p10687
aS'now tell me countrymen can gold become a property or not'
p10688
aS'can gold be converted from dead-money to a live strength or not'
p10689
aS'this is exactly what we have to do and you must stand with me'
p10690
aS'do not keep your gold in your homes'
p10691
aS'avail dual benefits its security and interest on the gold'
p10692
aS'you must avail this opportunity'
p10693
aS'another thing is in sovereign gold bonds you do not really get a physical gold in your hand'
p10694
aS'you get a sheet of paper and the value of that paper is equivalent to that of the amount of gold and the day you return that paper you will get the amount that is equivalent to the value of gold on that particular day'
p10695
aS'let us assume you buy a gold bond worth rs'
p10696
aS'1000 and five years later you go to return that bond and at that time the rate of gold is rs'
p10697
aS'2500 you will receive an amount of rs'
p10698
aS'2500 in exchange of that bond'
p10699
aS'so we are introducing this scheme now'
p10700
aS'due to this scheme we will not have to buy gold now'
p10701

aS'we can not say what will replace them in an uncertain future'
p10888
aS'but we might have a more fragmented world that is less capable of dealing with the challenges of our era'
p10889
aS'that is why india advocates reforms in global institutions'
p10890

p10891
aS'our institutions can not be representative of our world if they do not give voice to africa with more than a quarter of un members or the worlds largest democracy with one-sixth of humanity'
p10892
aS'that is why india and africa must speak in one voice for reforms of the united nations including its security council'
p10893
aS'excellencies today in many parts of the world the light of a bright future flickers in the storm of violence and instability'

p10920
aS'we will work together from the memory of our common struggles and the tide of our collective hopes from the richness of our heritage and the commitment to our planet from the pledge to our people and the faith in our future from the generosity of the african saying that a small home can hold hundred friends from the spirit of indias ancient belief that great souls are always taking the initiatives to do good to others from the inspiration of mandelas call to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others'

p10932
aS'for me jam is about just achieving maximum'
p10933
aS'maximum value for every rupee spentmaximum empowerment for our poormaximum technology penetration among the massesbut let me start by taking a brief look at the indian economy'
p10934
aS'by almost every major economic indicator india is doing better than when we took office 17 months ago'
p10935
aS'- gdp growth is up and inflation is down'
p10936
aS'- foreign investment is up and the current account deficit is down'
p10937
aS'- revenues are up and interest rates are down'
p10938
aS'- the fiscal deficit is down and the rupee is stable'
p10939
aS'obviously this did not happen by accident'
p10940
aS'and the world economy is not exactly doing well'
p10941
aS'this success is the result of a series of well thought out policies'
p10942
aS'many of the purely macro economic reforms we have undertaken are probably well known to this audience'
p10943
aS'we have embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation'
p10944
aS'we have entered for the first time into a monetary framework agreement with the reserve bank to curb inflation'
p10945
aS'even while cutting the fiscal deficit we havesubstantially increased productive public investment'
p10946
aS'this has been made possible in two ways'
p10947
aS'firstly we have imposed carbon taxes on fossil fuels'
p10948
aS'we took the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies'
p10949
aS'we have replaced them with taxes'
p10950
aS'the coal cess has been increased by four times from rs 50 per ton to rs 200 per ton'
p10951
aS'globally there is much talk of carbon taxes but much of it is just that - talk'
p10952
aS'we have actually acted'
p10953
aS'secondly wehave reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods like the use of technology'
p10954
aS'some of the methods are part of your agenda such as using aadhaar to target subsidies to the deserving'
p10955
aS'these are reforms that you are probably aware of'
p10956
aS'but our reforms are far broader and far deeper than is generally recognised'
p10957
aS'before i elaborate on this i would like to raise two issues'
p10958
aS'the first is reform for what'
p10959
aS'what is the aim of reform'
p10960
aS'is it just to increase the measured rate of gdp growth'
p10961
aS'or is it to bring about a transformation in society'
p10962
aS'my answer is clear'
p10963
aS'we must reform to transform'
p10964
aS'the second question is reform for whom'
p10965
aS'who is the target audience'
p10966
aS'is our aim to impress groups of experts and score points in intellectual discussions'
p10967
aS'or to achieve ranks in some international league table'
p10968
aS'again my answer is clear'
p10969
aS'reform is that which helps all citizens and especially the poor achieve a better life'
p10970
aS'it is sabka saath sabka vikas'
p10971
aS'in short reform is not an end in itself'
p10972
aS'reform for me is just a way station on the long journey to the destination'
p10973
aS'the destination is transformation of india'
p10974
aS'therefore reform to transform'
p10975
aS'and reforming to transform is a marathon not a sprint'
p10976
aS'the reforms we have undertaken are of many types'
p10977
aS'for simplicity i will classify them as financial structural and institutional'
p10978
aS'it will not be possible for me to cover all of them here'
p10979
aS'but i will certainly mention some of the most important'
p10980
aS'let me start with the financial reforms'
p10981
aS'we talk often about interest rates and credit policy'
p10982
aS'changes in interest rates are debated for months'
p10983
aS'tons of newsprint and hours of television are spent on it'
p10984
aS'interest rates are no doubt very important'
p10985
aS'but are they important to a person locked out of the banking system'
p10986
aS'to a person who has no prospect of ever lending or borrowing from a bank'
p10987
aS'and if large sections of a country are in this position then how important areinterest rates'
p10988
aS'it is for this reason that development experts have been advocating financial inclusion'
p10989
aS'what we have done in the last 17 months is to bring one hundred and ninety million people into the banking system'
p10990
aS'this is more than the population of most of the countries in the world'
p10991
aS'now these millions are part of our banking system and words like interest rate have a meaning for them'
p10992
aS'not only have these people been brought into the system but they have shown that there is great strength at the bottom of the pyramid'
p10993
aS'believe it or not accounts opened under the jan dhan yojana today have a total balance of almost rs'
p10994
aS'26000 crores or nearly four billion dollars'
p10995
aS'clearly our financial inclusion reform has been transformational'
p10996
aS'and yet this quiet revolution has hardly been noticed'
p10997
aS'the jan dhan yojana has also transformed the ability of the poor to make and to receive electronic payments'
p10998
aS'every jan dhan account holder is eligible for a debit card'
p10999
aS'indias banks are also being encouraged to operate mobile atms'
p11000
aS'a mobile atm is one where cash can be drawn and simple banking tasks done through a hand held device'
p11001
aS'thanks to jan dhan yojana and the rupay debit card we have also introduced healthy competition in the debit-credit card space'
p11002
aS'this has traditionally been dominated by a few international players'
p11003
aS'even one year ago there were hardly any indigenous card brands in the market'
p11004
aS'today 36 of debit cards in india are ru-pay cards'
p11005
aS'financial inclusion is not just about opening bank accounts or enabling electronic payments'
p11006
aS'i firmly believe that india has tremendous entrepreneurial energy'
p11007
aS'this needs to be harnessed so that we become a nation of job-creators rather than job seekers'
p11008
aS'when we took office we found that 58 million non-corporate enterprises provided one 128 million jobs'
p11009
aS'60 of them were in rural areas'
p11010
aS'over 40 were owned by people from the backward classes and 15 by scheduledcastes and tribes'
p11011
aS'but bank credit accounted for a tiny share of their financing'
p11012
aS'most of them never get any bank credit'
p11013
aS'in other words the most employment-intensive sector of the economy gets the least credit'
p11014
aS'while jan dhan yojana was to bring banking to the unbanked the second reform was to bring funding to the unfunded'
p11015
aS'we are creating a new financing and regulatory architecture under the micro-units development and refinance agency scheme popularly known asmudra'
p11016
aS'already under the pradhan mantri mudra yojana banks have provided more than six million loans to small businesses for a total value of nearly rs 38000 crores or six billion dollars'
p11017
aS'if one conservatively estimates that each loan creates 2 jobs we have laid the foundation for 12 million new jobs'
p11018
aS'even rs two hundred thousand crores invested in the corporate sector would not produce this many jobs'
p11019
aS'we have now launched a programme where each branch ofeach bank that is a total of 125000 bank branches will assist one dalit or a scheduled tribe person and one woman in starting a business'
p11020
aS'we are also creating an environment that fosters innovation and start-ups through the atal innovation mission and the self employment and talent utilisation programme'
p11021
aS'another financial reform is the provision of a safety net through new social security schemes'
p11022
aS'we have introduced three non-subsidised but low cost schemes covering accident insurance life insurance and pensions'
p11023
aS'because of their massive coverage the premia are low'
p11024
aS'there are now over 120 million subscribers'
p11025
aS'for many of these reforms to be successful we need a strong banking system'
p11026
aS'we inherited a system where cronyism and corruption were believed to be rampant in banking decisions and in appointments to public sector banks'
p11027
aS'after the first ever retreat of a prime minister with bankers known as the gyan sangam we have moved decisively to change this'
p11028
aS'major steps have been taken to improve efficiency including clear performance measures and accountability mechanisms'
p11029
aS'we havemade a commitment to ensuring adequate capital'
p11030
aS'but more than that there have been very powerful non-financial steps'
p11031
aS'interference in banking decisions has ended'
p11032
aS'a new process for appointments is being put in place under the bank boards bureau'
p11033
aS'credible and capable bankers have been appointed to head banks'
p11034
aS'for the first time since banks were nationalised 46 years ago private sector professionals have been appointed in key positions'
p11035
aS'this is a major reform'
p11036
aS'there is a whole eco-system focused on alleviating poverty'
p11037
aS'perhaps this can be called the poverty alleviation industry'
p11038
aS'obviously the intentions are good'
p11039
aS'well designed schemes and subsidies do have an important place'
p11040
aS'but empowering the poor is far more effective than empowering the poverty alleviation industry'
p11041
aS'our financial reforms empower the poor to fight poverty themselves'
p11042
aS'i can take the analogy of a house'
p11043
aS'the foundation and basic structure occupies someof the costs'
p11044
aS'then come the fixtures fittings and furniture'
p11045
aS'if the foundation and structure are weak any investment in nice fittings or attractive floor tiles or beautiful curtains is unlikely to last long'
p11046
aS'so also empowering the poor through financial inclusion and social security will provide a more stable and lasting solution'
p11047
aS'let me now turn to structural reforms in various sectors'
p11048
aS'agriculture remains indias mainstay in terms of providing livelihood'
p11049
aS'we have introduced a series of reforms'
p11050
aS'there was a tendency to divert subsidised fertiliser for the production of chemicals'
p11051
aS'a simple but very effective solution is neem-coating of fertiliser which makes it unsuitable for diversion'
p11052
aS'this had been tried on a small scale earlier'
p11053
aS'we are now moving towards universal neem-coating of urea'
p11054
aS'this has already saved crores of rupees of diverted farm subsidies'
p11055
aS'it is an example of how simple reforms can be very effective'
p11056
aS'we have introduced a soil health card nationally which tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil'
p11057
aS'it enables the farmer to choose the right quantity and mix of inputs'
p11058
aS'this greatly reduces wastage of inputs and increases crop yield besides protecting the soil'
p11059
aS'by reducing unnecessary chemical inputs it is also good for health of consumers'
p11060
aS'it enables farmers to choose the best crop for their soil'
p11061
aS'many farmers have been unaware that their land is actually more suitedfor a different crop'
p11062
aS'in economic terms it is a win-win-win-win'
p11063
aS'it reduces costs increases yields improves the environment and protects the health of consumers'
p11064
aS'140 million soil health cards will be issued requiring a collection of over twenty-five million soil samples'
p11065
aS'they will be tested through a nationwide network of nearly 1500 laboratories'
p11066
aS'about four million samples have already been collected'
p11067
aS'this too is a reform to transform'
p11068
aS'we have launched a housing for all program - one of the most ambitious in the world'
p11069
aS'it involves building twenty million urban houses and thirty million rural houses totalling nearly fifty million'
p11070
aS'the programme will make sure no indian is houseless'
p11071
aS'it will also generate a large amount of employment mainly for the unskilled the semi-skilled and the poor'
p11072
aS'this multi-pronged program is also a transformative reform'
p11073
aS'much has been said and written about indias labour markets'
p11074
aS'we have already undertaken some important steps'
p11075
aS'many workers in the organised sector have suffered when changing jobs by being unable to access provident fund and other benefits'
p11076
aS'the benefits accrued under one employer become difficult to account for under another employer'
p11077
aS'we have introduced a universal account number which will remain with an employee even when he changes jobs'
p11078
aS'this greatly improves labour mobility and makes life easier for employers and employees'
p11079
aS'we have gone a step further we have started empowering the unorganised sector employees by giving them a universal identity number and providing certain minimum social security benefits to them'
p11080
aS'over a period of years this will have a major impact on the quality of employment in india'
p11081
aS'before becoming prime minister i had received many inputs about the reforms needed in india from many economic experts'
p11082
aS'however none of them touched on the issue of cleanliness and sanitation'
p11083
aS'sanitation has languished for years as a poor cousin of health or of drinking water supply'
p11084
aS'it has often been viewed as a question of budgets and projects and expenditure'
p11085
aS'yet you will all agree that poor sanitation and lack of cleanliness is much more than anissue of health'
p11086
aS'it touches upon every aspect of our well-being'
p11087
aS'it is of particular importance to women'
p11088
aS'our swacch bharat or clean india campaign will impact not only health and sanitation but also uplift the status and security of women and above all create a powerful sense of well-being'
p11089
aS'if this reform succeeds as i am confident it will india would have been transformed'
p11090
aS'we have undertaken major managerial improvements in the transport sector'
p11091
aS'our major ports have seen a 5 growth in traffic and an 11 increase in operating income in 2014-15 despite a global contraction in trade volume'
p11092
aS'the shipping corporation of india had been making losses continuously for several years and had a loss of rs'
p11093
aS'275 crores in 2013-14'
p11094
aS'in 2014-15 it earned a profit of rs 201 crores a turnaround of nearly rs 500 crores in one year'
p11095
aS'the pace ofaward of new highway works has increased from 5'
p11096
aS'2 km per day in 2012-13 and 8'
p11097
aS'7 km per day in 2013-14 to 23'
p11098
aS'4 km per day currently'
p11099
aS'these managerial reforms in the working of the public sector will have large multiplier effects throughout the economy'
p11100
aS'another measure we have taken is to identify what can be called dead money and use it productively'
p11101
aS'the best example is gold'
p11102
aS'india is well known for its cultural affinity for gold'
p11103
aS'as economists you will probably understand that this so-called cultural affinity has a strong economic logic'
p11104
aS'india has often witnessed high inflation'
p11105
aS'gold is an excellent hedge against inflation and is a highly portable store of value'
p11106
aS'its portability and usability also make it a sourceof empowerment of women who traditionally are the main owners of gold jewellery'
p11107
aS'however this micro-economic virtue can become a macro-economic vice'
p11108
aS'it implies a high level of gold imports'
p11109
aS'we have just launched a series of gold-related schemes'
p11110
aS'these will provide indians with the inflation protection of gold along with a modest interest without actually holding it'
p11111
aS'if the scheme reaches its potential it will help meet the rational expectations of the public whilemoderating imports'
p11112
aS'surely this too is an important reform with potential to transform'
p11113
aS'let me now turn to institutional and governance reforms'
p11114
aS'for years the planning commission was widely criticised'
p11115
aS'it was generally seen as a cumbersome centralising force which imposed central will on the states'
p11116
aS'it is another matter that some of its strongest critics suddenly developed a nostalgic admiration for the institution they had hated till the previous day'
p11117
aS'after coming to power we created a new institution the national institution for transforming india or niti'
p11118
aS'my vision of niti is very different from theplanning commission'
p11119
aS'it is to be a collaborative forum for ideas and action where states are full partners and where centre and states meet in a spirit of co-operative federalism'
p11120
aS'perhaps some people thought this was merely a slogan'
p11121
aS'but we already have concrete examples of its transformative power'
p11122
aS'let me explain'
p11123
aS'as you all know the 14th finance commission recommended that states be given an enhanced share of central revenues as automatic devolution'
p11124
aS'despite some internal advice to the contrary i decided to accept the recommendation'
p11125
aS'this has created a need to restructure centrally sponsored schemes'
p11126
aS'ever since the first five year plan in 1952 such decisions were taken unilaterally by the centre'
p11127
aS'we did something very different'
p11128
aS'the task of fixing the sharingpattern of central schemes was entrusted not to a group of central ministers but to a sub-group of chief ministers in niti'
p11129
aS'and i am delighted to say that in a fine example of co-operative federalism at its best the chief ministers have unanimously agreed on a set of recommendations'
p11130
aS'this is despite the fact that this is a very complex issue and that they come from many different political parties'
p11131
aS'i received their report on 27th october'
p11132
aS'the main recommendationon the sharing pattern was accepted the very same day and written instructions were issued the very next day'
p11133
aS'on many other issues too the chief ministers are taking the lead in setting the national agenda'
p11134
aS'by reforming the institution we have transformed the relationship'
p11135
aS'our work on make in india and ease of doing business is of course well known'
p11136
aS'our push to make in india must be viewed in the context of the very slow growth in world trade'
p11137
aS'the growth rate of trade exceeded gdp growth from 1983 to 2008'
p11138
aS'since then trade has been growing more slowly than gdp'
p11139
aS'therefore producing for domestic consumption is important for growth'
p11140
aS'you are all probably aware that india has substantially improved its ranking in the world banks doing business survey'
p11141
aS'but a new feature is the very healthy and constructive competition among states'
p11142
aS'you would be surprised to know that among the top few states are jharkhand chattisgarh and odisha'
p11143
aS'this is an example of constructive competitive federalism'
p11144
aS'in a break with over sixty-five years of tradition we have involved states even in foreign policy'
p11145
aS'the ministry of external affairs has been asked to work with the states'
p11146
aS'when i visited china a state-to-state summit was also held'
p11147
aS'and states have been asked to create export promotion councils'
p11148
aS'making the states think globally is yet another reform with potential to transform'
p11149
aS'i firmly believe that indias people are far more mature and far more public-spirited than arm-chair critics and experts give them credit for'
p11150
aS'an important governance issue is the mutual trust between citizens and the state'
p11151
aS'we made a beginning in trusting the citizens by abolishing many requirements for attestation of signatures'
p11152
aS'for example the department of higher education has permitted self attestation by students of documents used for admission invarious academic courses'
p11153
aS'we also ended the requirement to visit government offices for life certification for pensioners by introducing online biometric identification'
p11154
aS'economists have traditionally believed that people act in their self interest'
p11155
aS'but india has a long tradition of voluntarism'
p11156
aS'we introduced the give-it-up campaign seeking the cooperation of the public in voluntarily giving up cooking gas subsidies'
p11157
aS'we promised them that for everyconnection given up one poor family currently without gas would be given a connection'
p11158
aS'this will enable us to liberate many poor women from the health hazards of using firewood including respiratory illness'
p11159
aS'the response has been tremendous'
p11160
aS'within a few months over four million indians have given up their cooking gas subsidies'
p11161
aS'most of them are not rich households and belong to the lower middle class'
p11162
aS'if any of you in this room still have a subsidised connectionlet me appeal to you to join them'
p11163
aS'this brings me to an achievement that i think even our worst critics do not dispute'
p11164
aS'this is the change in levels of corruption'
p11165
aS'for many years economists and other experts have held corruption to be one of the main constraints on the growth of any developing economy'
p11166
aS'we have taken decisive steps to curb corruption'
p11167
aS'i have already referred to what has been done in public sector banks'
p11168
aS'another major reform is well known'
p11169
aS'this is the removal of discretion inallocation of key resources'
p11170
aS'our auctions of coal spectrum and fm radio licences have produced major additional revenues'
p11171
aS'in the case of coal the major beneficiaries are some of indias poorest states who will now have much more resources for development'
p11172
aS'interviews for lower level government jobs have widely been seen as a source of corruption'
p11173
aS'we have recently abolished the system of interviews for lower level posts in government'
p11174
aS'we will rely on transparent writtenexamination results to decide who will be selected'
p11175
aS'our campaign against tax evasion and money laundering is also well known'
p11176
aS'rs'
p11177
aS'6500 crores has been assessed before the new black money act was implemented'
p11178
aS'additionally over rs 4000 crores has been declared under the new act'
p11179
aS'thus over rs 10500 crores of black money from abroad has been detected and assessed'
p11180
aS'if we can sustain this improvement in integrity and transparency what can be a more transformative reform'
p11181
aS'we are also taking several steps to serve the honest taxpayer better'
p11182
aS'electronic filing of returns now covers 85 of all tax returns'
p11183
aS'earlier electronic returns had to be followed by a paper verification which used to take weeks to be processed'
p11184
aS'this year we have introduced e-verification using aadhaar and over four million taxpayers made use of this facility'
p11185
aS'for them the entire process was simple electronic and completed instantly with no paper at all'
p11186
aS'this year 91 ofelectronic returns were processed within ninety days as compared to 46 last year'
p11187
aS'nearly 90 of refunds were issued within 90 days'
p11188
aS'i have asked the income tax department to move to a system where not only returns but also scrutiny is done without having to go to the office'
p11189
aS'queries could be raised and answered online or by email'
p11190
aS'there should be a visible electronic trail of what is pending with whom where and for how long'
p11191
aS'this is being piloted in five big cities'
p11192
aS'i have also instructed that the performance appraisal system for income tax officers be changed'
p11193
aS'the appraisal should reflect whether or not the officers orders and assessments have been upheld on appeal'
p11194
aS'this will deter corruption and also motivate officers to pass correct orders'
p11195
aS'when fully implemented these changes namely online scrutiny and changes in performance appraisal have transformative potential'
p11196
aS'this is a distinguished gathering'
p11197
aS'you have many interesting and thought provoking sessions ahead'
p11198
aS'my appeal to all of you is to think beyond conventional remedies'
p11199
aS'we should not limit our idea of reforms to a few standard notions'
p11200
aS'our idea of reforms should be inclusive and broad-based'
p11201
aS'the goal of reforms is not better headlines in the pink papers but better lives for our people'
p11202
aS'i am sure you with your knowledge will come up with even better ideas'
p11203
aS'i look forward tohearing from you of more reforms to transform which will make life better for the whole of india'
p11204
aS'then not only we in india but the whole world will benefit'
p11205
aS'thank you'
p11206
aS'lord speaker mr speaker mr'
p11207
aS'prime minister i am delighted to be in london'
p11208
aS'even in this globalised world london is still the standard for our times'
p11209
aS'the city has embraced the worlds diversity and represents the finest in human achievements'
p11210
aS'and i am truly honoured to speak in the british parliament'
p11211
aS'mr'
p11212
aS'speaker thank you for opening the doors to us here in this magnificent setting of the royal court'
p11213
aS'i know that the parliament is not in session'
p11214
aS'prime minister cameron looks relaxed and relieved'
p11215
aS'but i want to remind you mr prime minister that you owe me royalty for an election slogan'
p11216
aS'i know that you are hosting me at the chequers this evening'
p11217
aS'but i also know that you will understand if i am fair to both sides of the floor'
p11218
aS'especially since british mps of indian origin are evenly balanced between the treasury and the opposition benches'
p11219
aS'so i also extend my good wishes to the labour'
p11220
aS'indeed since these are still early days after the election my warm congratulationsto the members of the house'
p11221
aS'and greetings to the eminent leaders of britain and great friends of india present here today'
p11222
aS'so much of the modern history of india is linked to this building'
p11223
aS'so much history looms across our relationship'
p11224
aS'there are others who have spoken forcefully on the debts and dues of history'
p11225
aS'i will only say that many freedom fighters of india found their calling in the institutions of britain'
p11226
aS'and many makers of modern india including several of my distinguished predecessors from jawaharlal nehru to dr'
p11227
aS'manmohan singh passed through their doors'
p11228
aS'there are many things on which it is hard to tell anymore if they are british or indian the jaguar or the scotland yard for example'
p11229
aS'the brooke bond tea or my friend late lord ghulam nuns curry'
p11230
aS'and our strongest debates are whether the lords pitch swings unfairly or the wicket at eden gardens cracks too early'
p11231
aS'and we love the bhangra rap from london just as you like the english novel from india'
p11232
aS'on the way to this event prime minister cameron and i paid homage to mahatma gandhi outside the parliament'
p11233
aS'i was reminded of a question i was asked on a tour abroad'
p11234
aS'how is it that the statue of gandhi stands outside the british parliament'
p11235
aS'to that question my answer is the british are wise enough to recognise his greatness indians are generous enough to share him we are both fortunate enough to have been touched by his life and mission and we are both smart enough to use thestrengths of our connected histories to power the future of our relationship'
p11236
aS'so i stand here today not as a visiting head of government given the honour to speak in this temple of democracy'
p11237
aS'i am here as a representative of a fellow institution and a shared tradition'
p11238
aS'and tomorrow prime minister and i will be at the wembley'
p11239
aS'even in india every young footballer wants to bend it like beckham'
p11240
aS'wembley will be a celebration of one-half-million threads of life that bind us one and half million people - proud of their heritage in india proud of their home in britain'
p11241
aS'it will be an expression of joy for all that we share values institutions political system sports culture and art'
p11242

p11394
aS'with this in view we have launched the make in india initiative'

aS'i hope that your visit to india is pleasant and memorable'
p11613
aS'i also congratulate the officers of cbi who have received medals for distinguished service today'
p11614
aS'ladies and gentlemen governments across the world work to transform the lives of the poor and the marginalized'
p11615
aS'corruption is one of the principal challenges to that objective'
p11616
aS'we in india are currently in a crucial phase of nation building'
p11617
aS'our mission is to build a prosperous india'
p11618
aS'an india where - our farmers are capable - our workers satisfied - our women empowered - and our youth self-reliant this is not an impossible mission'
p11619
aS'however to achieve this objective it is essential to fight relentlessly against corruption'
p11620
aS'india stands committed in its fight against corruption'
p11621
aS'my government has taken significant steps to check corruption and the menace of black money in a short span of time'
p11622
aS'the very day that we assumed office we constituted a special investigation team under the supervision of the supreme court to look into the issue'
p11623
aS'we have entered into agreements with many countries for exchanging real time information on black money'
p11624
aS'the government has signed the inter government agreement with the united states to implement the foreign accounttax compliance act'
p11625
aS'this agreement enables indian tax authorities to receive financial account information of indians from foreign countries on an automatic basis'
p11626
aS'a comprehensive and deterrent law the black money undisclosed foreign income and assets and imposition of tax act has been enacted'
p11627
aS'it provides for stringent penalties and prosecution'
p11628
aS'we have also introduced a provision under the prevention of money laundering act for restitution of assets'
p11629
aS'this will enable millions of poor investors who have lost money in ponzi schemes to recover a part of their hard earned money'
p11630
aS'i hope that the partnership between stolen asset recovery initiative star and interpol will help in confiscation and recovery of stolen assets'
p11631
aS'i am sure that this conference will go a long way towards elimination of safe havens for the proceeds of corruption and help build secure exchange platforms for recovery of criminal assets'
p11632
aS'our recent initiatives to curb systemic corruption such as auction of coal blocks and fm radio spectrum have eliminated the element of discretion in allocation of national resources'
p11633
aS'this has brought about transparency in the system and restored faith of the citizens in government'
p11634
aS'it has also generated substantial revenues for the government which will benefit our people'
p11635
aS'ladies and gentlemen we are focused on providing system based and policy driven governance'
p11636
aS'a governance structure that is sensitive transparent and accountable'
p11637
aS'let me share an example to illustrate how corruption can be eliminated silently and efficiently by simple technology and policy based initiatives'
p11638
aS'when we assumed office i was informed that cooking gas cylinders were being subsidized to the tune of approximately four hundred rupees per cylinder'
p11639
aS'this subsidy was being provided to rich and poor alike'
p11640
aS'we decided that the subsidy should be credited directly into bank accounts of consumers with each account being linked to a unique aadhaar card'
p11641
aS'this single intervention has reduced the number of registered consumers claiming gas subsidy by about fifty million'
p11642
aS'subsequently wealso launched a campaign for the well off to voluntarily give up cooking gas subsidy'
p11643
aS'the response has been very encouraging'
p11644
aS'as on date more than 4'
p11645
aS'5 million people have given up their gas subsidy'
p11646
aS'friends'
p11647
aS'one of the challenges that we must address is governance deficit'
p11648
aS'this includes - inadequate capacity to deliver public services effectively and efficiently - lack of appropriate policy responses to emerging situations- and delays in project implementation my government has taken several steps to make the bureaucracy more efficient performance-oriented and accountable'
p11649
aS'the government is committed to ensuring probity among public servants and to protect them from frivolous allegations'
p11650
aS'equally the government is unsparing when it comes to punishing the corrupt'
p11651
aS'we have so far removed and ensured pension cuts of 45 senior officers of various services for unsatisfactory performance and delivery in public service'
p11652
aS'ladies and gentlemen globalization of organized crime poses a major threat to economies throughout the world'
p11653
aS'it is a well-known fact that dirty money drives out good money'
p11654
aS'organized crime can hamper investment and economic growth'
p11655
aS'it can also infiltrate or acquire control of large sectors of the economy'
p11656
aS'illicit funding promotes organized criminal activities like drug trafficking arms trafficking human trafficking and terrorism'
p11657
aS'the dastardly acts committed in paris a few days ago are a grim reminder that terrorists have shown remarkable flexibility and adaptability in meeting their funding requirements'
p11658
aS'they derive funding from a variety of criminal activities which include smuggling of narcotics bank robbery vehicle theft fake currency or from state sponsors and activities in failed states'
p11659
aS'disrupting fund flows constrains the capabilities of terrorists and reduces their ability to execute attacks'
p11660
aS'this involves putting in place both systemic safeguards and targeted economic sanctions based on credible counter-terrorism intelligence'
p11661
aS'targeting proceeds of crime is an important element in this fight against crime'
p11662
aS'hence there is an imperative need to focus our efforts to enhance international cooperation in the field of asset recovery for fighting crime corruption and terrorism'
p11663
aS'confiscation of property of offenders not only serves as punishment but also discourages commission of crime'
p11664
aS'in fact kautilya in his artha shastra had suggested confiscation of illegitimate income as one of the punishments for corrupt public servants'
p11665
aS'i am also pleased to note that the heads of state anti-corruption bureaus and cbi will deliberate on the related theme of tracking proceeds of corruption'
p11666
aS'this two decade old forum must not only focus on prosecution of offenders involved in corruption but also modify their standard operating procedures to more effectively target the proceeds of corruption'
p11667
aS'ladies and gentlemen economic liberalism and globalization have drastically increased the ability to park profits of crime anywhere in the world'
p11668
aS'today proceeds of crime can be routed through dozens of countries within seconds'
p11669
aS'by a process of layering the money-trail can be concealed'
p11670
aS'investigation agencies are limited by national boundaries'
p11671
aS'our government is committed to the implementation of a uniform global standard on automatic exchange of information on a fully reciprocal basis'
p11672
aS'this willfacilitate exchange of information regarding persons who have concealed their money in offshore financial centres and tax havens'
p11673
aS'interpol is playing an increasingly active role in asset recovery'
p11674
aS'since 2009 global focal point forum is actively promoting the exchange of corruption data among law enforcement agencies and anti-corruption entities worldwide'
p11675
aS'in this context mention must be made of interpols initiatives such as i-secom a secure web-based encrypted channel for the exchange of sensitive data among the specialized anti-corruption community'
p11676
aS'the new interpol notice could add value toasset-tracing investigations and facilitate real time information sharing in complex cases'
p11677
aS'i appreciate the efforts of interpol and its partners - world bank and unodc - in conceiving the idea and giving leadership to this forum that has the potential to put an end to safe havens for the corrupt'
p11678
aS'i am told that the excellent and proactive cooperation between interpol and indian investigative agencies has resulted in tracking of many fugitive criminals and their subsequent deportation or extradition'
p11679
aS'i would like this cooperation to deepen'
p11680
aS'cbi has been effectively assisting the indian law enforcement agencies and their foreign counterparts in overcoming the barriers that complicate the exchange of investigative information'
p11681
aS'i am also informed that cbi has been makinguse of interpol tools and databases for securing greater cooperation among law enforcement organizations throughout the world'
p11682
aS'it has also been consistently partnering interpol capacity building programmes'
p11683
aS'we are in the process of establishing an international centre of excellence in investigation at ghaziabad'
p11684
aS'this centre will render world class certified courses on investigation and prosecution in specialized and emerging domains of crime including cybercrime to the law enforcement community of india and abroad'
p11685
aS'a centralized technology vertical to focus on combating new age crimes like cybercrime is also being planned'
p11686
aS'there are several cases in the annals of indian judicial history in which conviction was secured solely on the basis of forensic expert opinion'
p11687
aS'india must therefore have adequate facilities to be able to clear the huge backlog of forensic opinion'
p11688
aS'the proceeds of crime and corruption are stolen assets'
p11689
aS'they do not belong to the country where they are stashed'
p11690
aS'they rightfully belong to the citizens of the country from which they have been plundered'
p11691
aS'i am well aware of the legal and procedural obstacles and differences in evidentiary standards that hinder asset recovery'
p11692
aS'to overcome these challenges police and law enforcement agencies should forge formal and informal relationships'
p11693
aS'i hope thisconference provides all of you such an opportunity'
p11694
aS'i also hope that the delegates will seriously deliberate and devise proper procedures and protocols to quicken the process of tracing identifying restraining confiscating and repatriating the stolen assets'

aS'friends'
p11706
aS'i have been saying that the 21st century belongs to asia'
p11707
aS'i say this because of the track record of the asean countries'
p11708
aS'together aseans ten member countries form an economic powerhouse'
p11709
aS'asean has emerged as one of the largest economic zones in the world'
p11710
aS'last fifteen years have seen your rapid and yet stable growth'

p11713
aS'in simple things like tourism you have done miracles'
p11714
aS'once again i compliment the leadership and people of asean countries for what they have achieved'
p11715
aS'when i analyse the asian miracle i find that small countries of asean and a big country like china both have done well'
p11716
aS'this shows that growth depends more on the spirit of people rather than the size of population'
p11717
aS'i have had personal relations with many leaders of this region'
p11718
aS'i have also visited a number of places a number of times'
p11719
aS'even as prime minister my engagements with the asian leadership started as soon as i took over'
p11720
aS'i met a number of asean leaders in the last summittoo'
p11721
aS'my government took office nearly 18 months ago'
p11722
aS'the indian economy faced serious challenges'
p11723
aS'a high fiscal deficit a high current account deficit a large number of stalled infrastructure projects and persistent inflation were among them'
p11724
aS'it was obvious that reforms were needed'
p11725
aS'we asked ourselves the question reforms for what'
p11726
aS'what is the aim of reform'
p11727
aS'is it just to increase the measured rate of gdp growth'
p11728
aS'or is it to bring about a transformation in society'
p11729
aS'my answer is clear we must reform to transform'
p11730
aS'in short reform is not an end in itself'
p11731
aS'reform for me is just a way station on the long journey to the destination'
p11732
aS'the destination is the transformation of india'
p11733
aS'we have to take the fruits of development to the margins of our geography and to the bottom of our demography'
p11734
aS'we have to touch lives while reaching for the sky'
p11735
aS'by almost every major economic indicator india is doing better than when we took office 18 months ago'
p11736
aS'- gdp growth is up and inflation is down- foreign investment is up and the current account deficit is down'
p11737
aS'- tax revenues are up and interest rates are down'
p11738
aS'- the fiscal deficit is down and the rupee is stable'
p11739
aS'obviously this did not happen by accident'
p11740
aS'and the world economy is not exactly doing well'
p11741
aS'this success is the result of a series of concerted policies'
p11742
aS'we have embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation'
p11743
aS'we have entered for the first time into a monetary framework agreement with the reserve bank to curb inflation'
p11744
aS'even while cutting the fiscal deficit we have substantially increased productive public investment'
p11745
aS'this has been made possible in two ways'
p11746
aS'firstly we have imposed carbon taxes on fossil fuels'
p11747
aS'we have taken the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies and have in fact imposed taxes on fossil fuels'
p11748
aS'we have increased the cess on coal by 300'
p11749
aS'globally there is much talk of carbon taxes'
p11750
aS'we have actually acted'
p11751
aS'secondly we havereduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods including targeting subsidies to the deserving through technology'
p11752
aS'overall there is increased confidence within and outside the country'
p11753
aS'the imf and world bank have expressed even better hope for our economy this year and after'
p11754
aS'the economist magazine this week stated that india is in healthier shape than any other big emerging economy'
p11755
aS'however as i said our aim is not mere reform but reform to transform'
p11756
aS'macro-economic stability is good'
p11757
aS'but to transform india much more needs to be done'
p11758
aS'we have begun a series of concerted steps'
p11759
aS'these include structural and institutional reforms'
p11760
aS'agriculture remains indias mainstay in terms of providing livelihood'
p11761
aS'we have introduced a series of simple but powerful structural reforms'
p11762
aS'there was a tendency to divert subsidised fertiliser for the production of chemicals'
p11763
aS'we have found a simple but very effective solution by neem-coating the fertiliser it becomes unsuitable for diversion'
p11764
aS'we are now moving towards universal neem-coating'
p11765
aS'this has already saved billions of rupees of diverted farm subsidies'
p11766
aS'we have also introduced soil health card'
p11767
aS'this tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil and then enables him to choose the right crop best quantity and mix of inputs'
p11768
aS'we have launched a housing for all program one of the most ambitious in the world'
p11769

p11772
aS'we have undertaken major improvements in the transport sector'
p11773

aS'and it was with his well known steely determination that he saw singapore through to its golden jubilee year'
p12342
aS'his impact was global'
p12343
aS'and in him india had a well wisher who spoke with the honesty of true friendship'
p12344
aS'he believed in indias potential at home and her role abroad more than many in india'
p12345
aS'for me he was a personal inspiration'
p12346
aS'from his singapore stories i drew many lessons'
p12347
aS'the most profound yet simple idea was that transformation of a nation begins with a change in the way we are'
p12348
aS'and that it was as important to keep your city and surroundings clean as it was to build modern infrastructure'
p12349
aS'for me too in india the swachh bharat campaign is not just a programme to clean our environment but to transform the way we think live and work'
p12350
aS'for quality efficiency and productivity are not just technical measures but also a state of mind and a way of life'
p12351
aS'so in my visit to singapore this march and in the observance of a days mourning in india we wanted to honour a true friend and a very special relationship'
p12352
aS'singapore is a nation that has become a metaphor for the reality of dreams'
p12353
aS'singapore teaches us many things'
p12354
aS'the size of a nation is no barrier to the scale of its achievements'
p12355
aS'and the lack of resources is no constraint for inspiration imagination and innovation'
p12356
aS'when a nation embraces diversity it can unite behind a common purpose'
p12357
aS'and international leadership flows from the power of thought not just from the orthodox measures of strength'
p12358
aS'singapore has done more than just lift a nation into the highest levels of prosperity within a generation'
p12359
aS'it has inspired this regions progress and led in its integration'
p12360
aS'and it has made others believe that the possibility of progress is within our horizons not an unseen and distant hope'
p12361
aS'singapores success flows not from the aggregate of numbers and the size of investments'
p12362
aS'it is based on what i believe is the key to success the quality of human resources the belief of a people and the resolve of a nation'
p12363
aS'distinguished members of the audience it is with the same vision that we are pursuing the transformation of india'
p12364
aS'people are the purpose of our efforts and they will be the power behind change'
p12365
aS'i do not judge the success of our efforts from the cold statistics of number but from the warm glow of smile on human faces'
p12366
aS'so one set of our policies are to empower our people'
p12367
aS'the other set to create the conditions in which enterprise flourishes opportunities expand and the potential of our citizens are unlocked'

p12371
aS'together with this software of change we are also building the hardware of progress next generation infrastructure revived manufacturing improved agriculture easier trade and smarter services'
p12372
aS'that is why we are moving on many fronts at the same time aware of the linkages that make up a comprehensive strategy'
p12373
aS'i learnt long ago that singaporeans are too well informed about india to be burdened with numbers by a visitor even from india'
p12374
aS'in any case for me the emergence of india as the fastest growing major economy in the world is less important than what is more enduring the wheels of change are moving confidence is growing resolve is stronger and the direction is clearer'
p12375
aS'and it is spreading across the nation as the most distant village and the farthest citizen begin to join the mainstream of national economy'
p12376
aS'distinguished guests india and singapore have been together at many crossroads of time'
p12377
aS'our relationship is written in the pages of history the footprints of culture the ties of kinship and the old connection of commerce'

aS'singapores success became an aspiration of indians'
p12380
aS'and in turn india became the hope for a more peaceful balanced and stable world'
p12381
aS'as india opened itself singapore became indias springboard to the world and gateway to the east'
p12382
aS'no one worked harder for it and no one deserves more credit for it than emeritus senior minister goh chok tong'
p12383

p12406
aS'the region is not an island in a vast ocean but deeply connected and influenced by the world beyond'
p12407
aS'we are also a region of disparities within and between states where the challenges of habitats food and water remain where our gifts of nature and wealth of traditions feel the pressure of rapid progress and our agriculture and islands are threatened by climate change'
p12408
aS'asia has seen some of this at different points of its history'
p12409
aS'but it has probably never been here before'
p12410
aS'and asia is still finding a path through its multiple transitions to a peaceful stable and prosperous future'

aS'today we constitute two-fifth of humanity and two of the worlds fastest growing major economies'

p12433
aS'india and japan may have discovered each other somewhat later'
p12434
aS'but my friend prime minister abe showed me in the magnificent shrines of kyoto the symbols of our much longer spiritual engagement'
p12435

aS'friends'
p12602
aS'whatever we are doing it is driven by two basic commitments one is that our people should be in the center'
p12603
aS'it is for them that we want investments'
p12604
aS'our faster growth will transform lives of one sixth of global community'
p12605
aS'the second commitment is towards our climate our planet our nature'
p12606
aS'our commitment to mitigate the dangers of climate change do not arise from economics or politics'
p12607
aS'they also do not arise from fear or favour'
p12608
aS'they arise from our fundamental belief that nature is our mother'
p12609
aS'nature provides and sustains our life hence we must nurture it'
p12610
aS'it is an article of faith'
p12611
aS'i assure the global community that we will do more than required'
p12612
aS'we will stretch ourselves to do more than what wecan normally do'
p12613
aS'both these commitments generate a wave of economic opportunities and activities which can not be matched by any other country'
p12614
aS'they also open up enormous opportunities for investors'
p12615
aS'to sum up i would like to say that in the last eighteen months - reforms are happening in a big way'
p12616
aS'they are now reaching to the last mile - reform is to transform the systems so that they perform - simply put they aim at enabling the people to realise their potentials and dreams - putting even more simply it means more charm on the faces and less forms in offices - in addition new frontiers and deeper foundations for financial markets have been laid - all together runways for take off of the economy have been made'
p12617
aS'recently the imf chief has said that india is a bright spot in the global economy'
p12618
aS'i did not want to wait for that brightness to reach to you on its own'
p12619
aS'hence i am here'

p12625
aS'so i speak in admiration for your resilience and resolve'
p12626
aS'and i salute the world for standing in full strength with france and paris'
p12627
aS'over the next few days we will decide the fate of this planet'
p12628
aS'we do so when the consequences of the industrial age powered by fossil fuel are evident especially on the lives of the poor'
p12629
aS'the prosperous still have a strong carbon footprint'
p12630
aS'and the worlds billions at the bottom of the development ladder are seeking space to grow'
p12631
aS'so the choices are not easy'
p12632
aS'but we have awareness and technology'
p12633
aS'we need now national will and a genuine global partnership'
p12634
aS'democratic india must grow rapidly to meet the aspirations of 1'
p12635
aS'25 billion people 300 million of whom are without access to energy'
p12636
aS'we are determined to do so guided by our ancient belief that people and planet are inseparable that human well being and nature are indivisible'
p12637
aS'so we have set ambitious targets'
p12638
aS'by 2030 we will reduce emissions by 33 to 35 per cent of 2005 levels and 40 per cent of our installed capacity will be from our non- fossil fuels'
p12639
aS'we will achieve it by expanding renewable energy - for example by adding 175 gigawatts of renewable generation by 2022'
p12640
aS'we will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2'
p12641
aS'5 billion tonnes worth of carbon dioxide'
p12642
aS'we are reducing dependence on fossil fuel through levies and reduction in subsidies switching sources of fuel where possible and transforming cities and public transportation'
p12643
aS'we hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely'
p12644
aS'it is not just a question of historical responsibility'
p12645
aS'they also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact'
p12646
aS'and climate justice demands that with the little carbon space we still have developing countries should have enough room to grow'
p12647
aS'this also means aggressive mitigation action by developed countries before 2020 including ratification of 2nd commitment period of kyoto protocol removing conditions and revisiting targets'
p12648
aS'the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities must remain the bedrock of our collective enterprise across all areas - mitigation adaptation and means for implementation'
p12649
aS'anything else would be morally wrong and disparities'
p12650
aS'equity means that national commitments must be consistent with the carbon space nations occupy'
p12651
aS'we also need a strong agreement on adaptation and loss and damage'
p12652
aS'developed countries must fulfill their responsibility to make clean energy available affordable and accessible to all in the developing world'
p12653
aS'this is in our collective interest'
p12654
aS'so we look to the developed countries to mobilize 100 billion us dollars annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in the developing countries'
p12655
aS'they must fulfill their commitment in a credible transparent and meaningful manner'
p12656
aS'energy is a basic human need'
p12657
aS'so we need an ambitious technology initiative driven by a public purpose not just market incentives'
p12658
aS'this includes intellectual property'
p12659
aS'for this we need to scale up green climate fund that will improve access to technology and intellectual property'
p12660
aS'we still need conventional energy'
p12661
aS'we should make it clean not impose an end to its use'
p12662
aS'and there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others'
p12663
aS'we welcome stocktaking that is transparent covers both support and commitments and based on differentiation'
p12664
aS'ultimately for success moderating our lifestyle is necessary and possible for a low carbon future'
p12665
aS'excellencies the presence of 196 countries tells us that we have a chance to unite behind a common purpose'
p12666
aS'we will succeed if we have the wisdom and courage to craft a genuinely collective partnership that balances responsibilities and capabilities with aspirations and needs'

p12679
aS'climate change is a major global challenge'
p12680
aS'but climate change is not of our making'
p12681
aS'it is the result of global warming that came from the prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel'
p12682
aS'but we in india face its consequences today'
p12683
aS'we see it in the risks of our farmers the changes in weather patterns and the intensity of natural disasters'

p12690
aS'this will mean a partnership in which those who have the luxury of choices and the capability of technology will make adjustments to sharply reduce their carbon emission'
p12691
aS'the extent of their commitment and the strength of their action must be consistent with the carbon space they occupy'
p12692
aS'and they must leave enough of what is left of our carbon space to let developing countries grow'
p12693
aS'they should share resources and technology with those who live between want and hope so that we can meet the universal aspiration for clean energy'
p12694
aS'it will also mean that the developing world will also try to have a lighter carbon footprint on their growth path'
p12695
aS'we want the conviction of the world to be matched by efforts to create conditions in which we can succeed'
p12696
aS'because our challenge is pressing our efforts must be urgent'
p12697

aS'indias progress is our destiny and the right of our people'
p12701
aS'but we are a nation that must also lead in combating climate change'
p12702
aS'it stems from our obligation to give our people clean air clean rivers resilient farms healthy habitats and forests rich with life'
p12703
aS'it comes from our conviction that we must aim not just for higher incomes but better quality of life'
p12704
aS'it comes from our commitment to the world'

p13023
aS'for this has always been the course of this regions history'
p13024
aS'and it must be the path to its future'
p13025
aS'but brave and tireless as the afghans are in defending their nations afghanistan will succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the border when nurseries and sanctuaries of terrorism are shut and their patrons are no longer in business'

p13051
aS'we must do that for the soldier from a foreign land who laid down his life in an afghan village that he had never heard of and for a people he had never known and for the enormous sacrifices that afghans have made for a life that others take for granted'
p13052
aS'we must support afghanistan without time lines because the new clouds of extremism and terrorism are rising even as the old ones continue to darken our skies and because afghans are not only fighting for their future but are standing up for all of us and a safer world'
p13053
aS'the world will be a better place when we can experience the real wealth of afghan people in their diversity and rich heritage'
p13054
aS'it is time for all afghans everyone in the region and the rest of the world to come together'
p13055

p13179
aS'the power department of the state and indian government were functional earlier as well but from the day 1000 day target to provide electricity to every village has been set we get news everyday that power supply is available in some or the other village and the happiness of the inhabitants knows no bounds'
p13180

p13182
aS'the biggest achievement of this task is that the government officials involved in this task will have immense satisfaction that they have done something which will bring about such a big change in the lives of the people and the village itself'

p13199
aS'after that all government departments started discussing it'
p13200
aS'can india become a start-up capital'
p13201
aS'can our states work together for new start-ups for youth and encourage innovations with start-ups be it in the manufacturing sector service sector or agriculture'
p13202
aS'everything should be new new ways and new thinking - after all the world does not move ahead without innovation'

aS'you will be presented with a structure'
p13207
aS'in this program all the iits iims central universities nits wherever there is young generation they will be brought together via live connectivity'
p13208
aS'there is an established thinking regarding the start-ups that they are meant only for the digital world or the it profession'
p13209
aS'this is not true at all we need to modify it according to the needs of india'
p13210
aS'for example when a poor person works somewhere as a labourer and there is a lot of physical effort involved but if a young man innovates something which can reduce the physical effort and help the labourer- i will call it as a start-up'
p13211
aS'i will ask the bank to help such an individual and i will tell him to move ahead with courage'
p13212
aS'you will get the market'
p13213
aS'similarly is the intellectual wealth limited to a few selected cities or what'
p13214
aS'this thinking is wrong'
p13215
aS'the indian youth all over the country has talent all they need is opportunities'
p13216
aS'this start-up india stand-up india should not be limited to a few cities only'
p13217
aS'it should spread to every corner of india'
p13218
aS'and i will request the state governments to take this forward'
p13219
aS'i will definitely interact with you on 16th january and will discuss this in detail'
p13220
aS'your suggestions are always welcome'
p13221
aS'dear young friends 12th january is the birth anniversary of swami vivekananda'
p13222
aS'there are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him'
p13223
aS'since 1995 12th january the birth anniversary of vivekananda is celebrated as the national youth festival'
p13224
aS'this year it will be organized from 12-16th january in raipur district of chhattisgarh'

p13229
aS'a feeling of determination will be experienced'
p13230
aS'can you give me suggestions regarding this youth festival'
p13231
aS'i would request the youth to send me their suggestions directly on the narendra modi app'
p13232
aS'i want to gain an insight into your understanding'
p13233
aS'and that it gets reflected in the youth festival for that i will give the government reasonable suggestions and information'
p13234
aS'so i will wait dear friends for your suggestions on the youth festival on the narendra modi app'
p13235
aS'dilip chauhan from ahmedabad gujarat who is a visually challenged teacher celebrated accessible india day in his school'
p13236
aS'he called me up to express his feelings sir we celebrated accessible india campaign in our school'
p13237
aS'i am a visually challenged teacher and i addressed 2000 children on the issue of disability and how we can spread awareness and help differently-abled people'
p13238
aS'and the students response was fantastic we enjoyed in the school and the students were inspired and motivated to help the disabled people in the society'
p13239
aS'i think it was a great initiative by you'
p13240
aS'dilip ji thank you very much'
p13241
aS'you are yourself working in this field'
p13242
aS'you understand everything and you must have faced a lot of difficulties too'
p13243
aS'sometimes when we meet someone with different ability in the society then a lot of things come to our mind'
p13244
aS'we express our perception of him based on our thinking'
p13245
aS'there are some people who lose a limb or body part in an accident'
p13246
aS'some people are born with some defects'
p13247
aS'and for these people different terms are used and a lot of thought goes on behind the usage of these terms'
p13248
aS'all the time people feel that this kind of identification does not sound nice and respectable'
p13249
aS'at some point we heard handicapped then it was disabled and somewhere it is specially-abled so many terms have been used'
p13250
aS'it is true that words have their own significance'
p13251
aS'this year when the government of india started the sugamya india programme i was supposed to attend it but could not make it because of severe floods in chennai and other areas of tamil nadu'
p13252
aS'however since i had to attend that program some thoughts kept coming in my mind'
p13253
aS'that time i thought that we call or know those people as handicapped since they are lacking in some ways in terms of their body structure or whose organs do not function properly'
p13254
aS'however at times when we interact with them we realize that we see only the deficits with our eyes but god has certainly bestowed them with some extra powers'
p13255
aS'god has bestowed upon them some different power which we can not see with our eyes but it is only when we see them working do we realize their talent'
p13256
aS'we think o great'
p13257
aS'look how he works'
p13258
aS'so i thought that upon looking at them with our eyes we feel that they are handicapped but experiences tell us that they have some extra power'
p13259
aS'so i thought why not use the term divyang instead of viklang in our country'
p13260
aS'they are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have'
p13261
aS'i like this term'
p13262
aS'my dear countrymen can we make it a habit to use the word divyang and make it popular'
p13263
aS'i hope that you will take this forward'
p13264
aS'that day we started the sugamya bharat campaign'
p13265
aS'under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the divyang people'
p13266
aS'be it schools hospitals government offices bus depots railway stations everywhere ramps accessible parking accessible lifts braille many amenities will be made available'
p13267
aS'to make things sugamya - we need innovation we need technology we need systems and we also need empathy from people'
p13268
aS'we have taken the initiative'
p13269
aS'we are receiving public participation too'
p13270
aS'people like it'
p13271
aS'you too can join in the manner you deem fit'
p13272
aS'my dear countrymen the government schemes will continue exist and run but it is necessary that these schemes always remain operational'
p13273
aS'the schemes should be operational till the last mile individual has benefitted from them'
p13274
aS'they should not have a dead existence in government files'
p13275
aS'after all these schemes are meant for common man the poor people'
p13276
aS'in the past few days the government has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of schemes reach out to the rightful owners'
p13277
aS'in our country we give subsidy for the gas cylinders'
p13278
aS'crores of rupees were spent on it but we did not know if it reached the right people or not if this subsidy reached people on time or not'
p13279
aS'the government has made some changes in the scheme'
p13280
aS'the government undertook the largest direct benefit transfer scheme to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of jan dhan account or aadhar card etc'
p13281
aS'i am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in guinness book of world records as the largest direct benefit transfer scheme which has been implemented successfully'
p13282
aS'this scheme is known as pahal and this experiment has been very successful'
p13283
aS'till november end around 15 crore lpg customers have become its beneficiaries'
p13284
aS'the government money is being directly transferred to the accounts of 15 crore beneficiaries'
p13285
aS'no middlemen nor any recommendation nor any possibility of corruption'
p13286
aS'on one hand was the aadhar card scheme and on the other was the jan dhan account'
p13287
aS'thirdly the state and indian government compiled the lists of beneficiaries'
p13288
aS'that was connected to account and aadhar'
p13289
aS'this work is still in progress'
p13290
aS'nowadays even the mnrega scheme which provides employment opportunities in villages is being connected to it'
p13291
aS'there were lots of complaints about this scheme'
p13292
aS'in many places the wages of the labourers is now being directly transferred into their accounts'
p13293
aS'there were complaints about student scholarships too they too are being transferred into their accounts'
p13294
aS'this has been started and will be gradually taken forward'
p13295
aS'till now around 40000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes'
p13296
aS'according to my rough estimate around 35-40 schemes are now under direct benefit transfer'
p13297
aS'my dear countrymen 26th january is the golden moment in the life of indian democracy'
p13298
aS'this is a beautiful co-incidence that baba saheb ambedkar the maker of the indian constitution his 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated this year'
p13299
aS'we organized a two day special discussion on the constitution and it was a very good experience'
p13300
aS'all the parties and all the members deliberated on the sanctity of the constitution its importance to understand the true interpretation of the constitution'
p13301
aS'it was an excellent discussion'
p13302
aS'we should take this thing forward'
p13303
aS'can republic day be an opportunity to connect the masses with the system'
p13304
aS'our constitution grants us several rights and there are many discussions on it and it should be so and it is equally important'
p13305
aS'but constitution equally emphasizes on duty also'
p13306
aS'but it is seen that duties are hardly discussed'
p13307
aS'at the most whenever there are elections then we see advertisement all around us they write on the walls and hoardings are put to tell that to vote is our sacred duty'
p13308
aS'there is a lot of talk about duties during elections but why not discuss our duties in general life too'
p13309
aS'this year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedkar then can we make 26th january a medium to organize debates poetry slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools colleges villages cities and various organizations and societies'
p13310
aS'if 125 crore indians take dutiful steps one after the other they can make history'
p13311
aS'but at least lets start with discussions'
p13312
aS'i have an idea send me an essay or poem before 26th january about duty in hindi or english or your native language'
p13313
aS'can you send me'
p13314
aS'i want to know your views'
p13315
aS'send them on my portal my gov'
p13316
aS'i would like to know what my young generation thinks about their duties'
p13317
aS'i want to give a small suggestion'
p13318
aS'on 26th january we celebrate republic day'
p13319
aS'can we citizens and school and college students take up the initiative of cleaning the statue of any great men installed in our city of cleaning the premises we can do best of cleanliness and best of decoration on the occasion of 26th january'
p13320
aS'and i am not saying this on government lines'
p13321
aS'we become so emotional about getting the statues of great men erected but become equally complacent when it comes to maintaining them'
p13322
aS'as a society as a nation can we make it a natural tendency to respect the statues of our great men'
p13323
aS'on this 26th january let us make an effort that we will respect such great men and keep the premises clean'
p13324
aS'but this should be done by the citizens willfully'
p13325
aS'dear countrymen greetings to you for a happy new year 2016'

p13337
aS'for our confidence about the future of india comes from our faith in you'
p13338
aS'it is a huge honour and privilege to address the 103rd science congress in the centenary year of the university of mysore'
p13339
aS'some of the tallest leaders of india have passed through the doors of this respected institution'
p13340
aS'the great philosopher and indias second president dr'
p13341
aS'radhakrishnan and bharat ratna professor cnr rao are among them'
p13342
aS'the history of the science congress and the university of mysore began around the same time'
p13343
aS'it was the time of a new awakening in india'
p13344
aS'it sought not just freedom but also human advancement in india'
p13345
aS'it wanted not just an independent india but an india that could stand independently on the strength of its human resources scientific capabilities and industrial development'
p13346
aS'this university is a testimony to the vision of a great generation of indians'
p13347
aS'now we have launched yet another revolution of empowerment and opportunities in india'
p13348
aS'and we are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development'
p13349
aS'the world has progressed because of human instinct to enquire and explore for knowledge but also to address human challenges'
p13350
aS'no one reflected this spirit more than late president dr'
p13351
aS'apj abdul kalam'
p13352
aS'his was a life of outstanding scientific achievements and his was a heart of boundless compassion and concern for humanity'
p13353
aS'for him the highest purpose of science was the transformation of the life of the weak the under-privileged and the youth'
p13354
aS'and his lifes mission was a self-reliant and a self-assured india that was strong and cared for its people'
p13355
aS'your theme for this congress is a fitting tribute to his vision'
p13356
aS'and it is leaders like professor rao and president kalam and scientists like you who have placed india at the forefront of science and technology in many areas'
p13357
aS'our success spans from the core of the tiny atom to the vast frontier of space'
p13358
aS'we have enhanced food and health security and we have given hope for a better life to others in the world'
p13359
aS'as we increase the level of our ambition for our people we will also have to increase the scale of our efforts'
p13360
aS'so for me good governance is not just about policy and decision making transparency and accountability'
p13361
aS'it is also about integrating science and technology into the choices we make and the strategies we pursue'
p13362
aS'our digital networks are expanding the quality and reach of public services and social benefits for the poor'
p13363
aS'and in the first ever national space conference we identified 170 applications that touch almost every aspect of governance development and conservation'
p13364
aS'we are launching startup india that will encourage innovation and enterprise'
p13365
aS'we are creating technology incubators in academic institutions'
p13366
aS'and i have asked for a framework of scientific audit for scientific departments and institutions in the government'
p13367
aS'it is with the same spirit of cooperative federalism that is shaping centre-state relations in every area that i am encouraging greater scientific collaboration between central and state institutions and agencies'
p13368
aS'we will also try to increase the level of resources for science and deploy them in accordance with our strategic priorities we will make it easier to do science and research in india improve science administration and expand the supply and improve the quality of science education and research in india'
p13369
aS'at the same time innovation must not be just the goal of our science'
p13370
aS'innovation must also drive the scientific process'
p13371
aS'frugal innovation and crowd sourcing are examples of efficient and effective scientific enterprise'
p13372
aS'and innovation in approach is not just the obligation of the government but also the responsibility of the private sector and the academia'
p13373
aS'in a world of resource constraints and competing claims we have to be smart in defining our priorities'
p13374
aS'and it is especially important in india where challenges are many and the scale is enormous from health and hunger to energy and economy'
p13375
aS'distinguished delegates today i wanted to speak to you about one of the biggest challenges for the world and one that dominated global attention last year to define a path to a more prosperous future for our world and a more sustainable future for our planet'
p13376
aS'in 2015 the world took two historic steps'
p13377
aS'last september the united nations adopted the development agenda for 2030'
p13378
aS'it places elimination of poverty by the end of 2030 and economic development at the top of our priorities but with equal emphasis on sustainability of our environment and our habitats'
p13379
aS'and last november in paris the world came together to craft a historic agreement to change the course of our planet'
p13380
aS'but we achieved something else that is equally important'
p13381
aS'we succeeded in bringing innovation and technology to the heart of the climate change discourse'
p13382
aS'we were consistent in our message that it is not enough to speak of targets and restraints'
p13383
aS'it is essential to find solutions that help us transition easily to a future of clean energy'
p13384
aS'i also said in paris that innovation is important not just for combating climate change but also for climate justice'
p13385
aS'for the developed world must leave enough of the little carbon space left for developing countries to grow'
p13386
aS'for this we need research and innovation to make clean energy technology available accessible and affordable for all'
p13387
aS'at paris president hollande president obama and i joined a number of global leaders for an innovation summit'
p13388
aS'we pledged to double national investments in innovation and build a global partnership that combines the responsibility of governments with the innovative capacity of the private sector'
p13389
aS'i also suggested an international network of 30-40 universities and labs focusing for next ten years on transforming the way we produce distribute and consume energy'
p13390
aS'we will also pursue this in g 20'
p13391
aS'we need innovation to make renewable energy much cheaper more reliable and easier to connect to transmission grids'
p13392
aS'this is especially critical for india to achieve our target of adding 175 gw of renewable generation by 2022'
p13393
aS'we must also make fossil fuel like coal cleaner and more efficient'
p13394
aS'and we should tap newer sources of renewable energy from ocean waves to geothermal energy'
p13395
aS'at a time when energy sources that fueled the industrial age have put our planet in peril and as the developing world now seeks to lift billions of people into prosperity the world must turn to sun to power our future'
p13396
aS'so at paris india launched an international solar alliance to forge a partnership between solar-rich countries'
p13397
aS'we need science and technology not just to make clean energy an integral part of our existence but also to combat the impact of climate change on our lives'
p13398
aS'we have to develop climate resilient agriculture'
p13399
aS'we must understand the impact of climate change on our weather biodiversity glaciers and oceans and how to adjust to them'
p13400
aS'we must strengthen our ability to forecast natural disasters'
p13401
aS'distinguished delegates we must also address the rising challenges of rapid urbanisation'
p13402
aS'this will be critical for a sustainable world'
p13403
aS'for the first time in human history we are in an urban century'
p13404
aS'by the middle of this century two-thirds of the worlds population will live in cities'
p13405
aS'a little less than 3'
p13406
aS'0 billion people will join the existing 3'
p13407
aS'5 billion urban dwellers'
p13408
aS'and 90 of the increase will come from developing countries'
p13409
aS'many urban clusters in asia will exceed the population of mid-sized countries elsewhere in the world'
p13410
aS'more than 50 of india will be living in urban habitats by 2050'
p13411
aS'and by 2025 india may already have more than 10 of the global urban population'
p13412
aS'studies suggest that nearly 40 of the global urban population lives in informal settlements or slums where they face a range of health and nutritional challenges'
p13413
aS'cities are the major engines of economic growth employment opportunities and prosperity'
p13414
aS'but cities account for more than two-thirds of global energy demand and result in up to 80 of global greenhouse gas emission'
p13415
aS'that is why i have placed so much emphasis on smart cities'
p13416
aS'it is not just about cities that are networked to become more efficient safe and better in delivery of services'
p13417
aS'it is also a vision of sustainable cities that are both locomotives of our economies and havens of healthy living'
p13418
aS'we will need sound policies to achieve our goals but we will rely on science and technology to provide creative solutions'
p13419
aS'we must develop better scientific tools to improve city planning with sensitivity to local ecology and heritage and reduce the demand for transportation improve mobility and reduce congestion'
p13420
aS'much of our urban infrastructure is yet to be built'
p13421
aS'we must maximise the use of local material with scientific improvements and and make buildings more energy efficient'
p13422
aS'we have to find affordable and practical solutions for solid waste management converting waste into building material and energy and recycling waste water'
p13423
aS'urban agriculture and ecology should get more attention'
p13424
aS'and our children must breathe cleaner city air'
p13425
aS'and we need solutions that are comprehensive and rooted in science and innovation'
p13426
aS'we need your inputs to make our cities more immune to the consequences of natural disasters and our homes more resilient'
p13427
aS'this will also mean making retrofit of buildings affordable'
p13428
aS'distinguished delegates a sustainable future for this planet will depend not only on what we do on land but also on how we treat our oceans'
p13429
aS'oceans occupy more than 70 of our planet and over 40 of humanity and 60 of the worlds largest cities are found within 100 kilometers of the coast'
p13430
aS'we are at the cusp of a new era where oceans will become important drivers of our economies'
p13431
aS'their sustainable use can bring prosperity and give us clean energy new medicines and food security beyond just fisheries'
p13432
aS'that is why i refer to the small island states as large ocean states'
p13433
aS'ocean is critical to indias future too with over 1300 islands a 7500 km coastline and 2'
p13434
aS'4 million square kilometers of exclusive economic zone'
p13435
aS'that is why in the past year we have increased our focus on ocean or blue economy'
p13436
aS'we will raise the level of our scientific efforts in marine science'
p13437
aS'we will set up an advanced centre of research in marine biology and biotechnology and establish a network of coastal and island research stations in india and abroad'
p13438
aS'we have entered into agreements on marine science and ocean economy with several countries'
p13439
aS'we will also hold an international conference on ocean economy and pacific island countries in new delhi in 2016'
p13440
aS'distinguished delegates rivers have played as important a role in human history as oceans'
p13441
aS'civilisations have been nurtured by rivers'
p13442
aS'and rivers will remain critical for our future'
p13443
aS'so revival of rivers is an essential part of my commitment for a cleaner and healthier future for our society economic opportunities for our people and renewal of our heritage'
p13444
aS'we need regulations policy investments and management to achieve our objective'
p13445
aS'but we will succeed only when we integrate technology engineering and innovation into our efforts not just to clean our rivers now but to keep them healthy in the future as well'
p13446
aS'for this we also need scientific understanding of the impact of urbanisation farming industrialisation and groundwater use and contamination on the river eco-system'
p13447
aS'river is the soul of nature'
p13448
aS'their renewal must be an element of a larger effort to sustain nature'
p13449
aS'in india we see humanity as part of nature not outside or superior to it and divinity manifested in natures diverse forms'
p13450
aS'so conservation is rooted in the natural instincts of our culture and tradition and in our commitment to the future'
p13451
aS'india has a rich heritage of ecological knowledge'
p13452
aS'we have scientific institutions and human resources to mount concerted national action on conservation of nature that is rooted firmly in scientific studies and methods'
p13453
aS'distinguished delegates and if we wish to restore the harmony between human and nature we must also harness the full potential of traditional knowledge'
p13454
aS'societies across the world have developed this enormous wealth through wisdom gathered over the ages'
p13455
aS'and they hold the secrets to economic efficient and environment friendly solutions to many of our problems'
p13456
aS'but today they are at risk of extinction in our globalised world'
p13457
aS'like traditional knowledge science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of nature'
p13458
aS'so we must recognize that science as we see it does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world'
p13459
aS'and we must bridge the distance between traditional knowledge and modern science so that we can craft local and more sustainable solutions for our challenges'
p13460
aS'so in agriculture even as we seek to make our farms yield more reduce the intensity of our water use or increase the nutrient content of our farm output we should also integrate traditional techniques local practices and organic farming to make our agriculture less resource intensive and more resilient'
p13461
aS'and in the area of health modern medicines have transformed healthcare'
p13462
aS'but we must also use scientific techniques and methods to delve deeper into traditional medicines and practices like yoga for more holistic lifestyle and change our paradigm from treatment to wellness'
p13463
aS'this is especially important in dealing with growing challenge of lifestyle diseases that take a huge toll in terms of human lives and economic costs'
p13464
aS'distinguished delegates as a nation we still inhabit many worlds'
p13465
aS'we are at the global frontiers of achievements in science and technology'
p13466
aS'we also see the uncertainty and despair of many living at the edge of existence looking for a life of hope opportunity dignity and equity'
p13467
aS'we must meet these aspirations at a speed and on a scale that is rare in human history'
p13468
aS'and from the richness of our tradition the consciousness of our age and the strength of our commitment to our world we must choose the most sustainable path possible'
p13469
aS'the success of one-sixth of humanity will also mean a more prosperous and a sustainable future for the world'
p13470
aS'we can only do this with your leadership and support'
p13471
aS'we will realise it when in the words of vikram sarabhai we encourage scientists to interest themselves in problems outside their fields of specialization'
p13472
aS'and the impact of science will be the most when scientists and technologists will keep the principles of what i call five es at the centre of their enquiry and engineering economy when we find cost effective and efficient solutions environment when our carbon footprint is the lightest and the impact on the ecology is the least possible energy when our prosperity relies less on energy and the energy we use keeps our skies blue and our earth green'
p13473
aS'empathy when our efforts are in tune with our culture circumstances and social challenges'
p13474
aS'equity when science advances inclusive development and improves the welfare of the weakest'
p13475
aS'this year we mark a hundred years of a significant moment in the history of science when albert einstein published in 1916 the foundation of the general theory of relativity'
p13476
aS'today we must recall the humanism that defined his thought concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavours'
p13477
aS'nothing can be a higher duty for us whether we are in public life or we are private citizens and whether we are in business or explore science than to leave the planet in a better state for our future generations'
p13478
aS'let the different disciplines of science technology and engineering unite behind this common purpose'
p13479
aS'thank you'

p13483
aS'nagendra dignitaries on the dais esteemed guests from all over the world and yoga enthusiasts it is a great pleasure and privilege to participate in the 21st international conference on frontiers in yoga research and its applications'
p13484
aS'iam deeply grateful to vivekananda yoga anusandhan sansthan for organizing this conference'
p13485
aS'vivekanandas vision was a synthesis of a deep reading of the indian and western thought and drew its spirit from our ancient philosophy and knowledge'
p13486
aS'he not only made a unique contribution to the spiritual revival of india he also placed our timeless wisdom before the world'
p13487
aS'he had a deep understanding of the beauty of human diversity and spoke passionately for unity in our world'
p13488
aS'this is a particularly special year for the science of yoga'
p13489
aS'on june 21 more than a million people in 192 countries came together to celebrate the first international day of yoga'
p13490
aS'the overwhelming global support is a mark of yogas growing international popularity'
p13491
aS'it is also a symbol of the universal aspiration for health and well being'
p13492
aS'it reflects the shared global desire for balance between human and mother nature and peace and harmony between people and nations'
p13493
aS'above all it demonstrated once again the capacity of people from different cultures to reach beyond the familiar boundaries of their lives and unite in pursuit of a larger good'
p13494
aS'it is this spirit of unity that demonstrates the timeless science of yoga'
p13495
aS'and it is this belief in the power of yoga and faith in humanity that i proposed this initiative in my inaugural address to the united nations general assembly in september 2014'
p13496
aS'when it comes to a sustainable future for our world a healthy habit and happier people a change in our way of life that influences the choices we make as individuals nations and global community is important'
p13497
aS'this is a recognition that is dawning on the world'
p13498
aS'and across cultures and geography people are increasingly taking to yoga to redefine their lives - to find oneness between their inner self and outer world between their existence and their environment'
p13499
aS'the who fact sheet on the global burden of disease says that non-communicable diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide'
p13500
aS'in 2008 80 percent of deaths due to these diseases were in developing countries up from 40 percent in 1990'
p13501
aS'by 2030 low-income countries will have eight times more deaths attributed to ncds than high-income countries'
p13502
aS'in india cardiovascular diseases cancers chronic respiratory diseases diabetes and other non communicable diseases are estimated to account for 60 of all deaths'
p13503
aS'these diseases account for about 40 of all hospital stays and roughly 35 of all recorded outpatient visits'
p13504
aS'we face the tragedy of productive lives cut short and families that must deal with untimely loss the huge toll on the economy and the excessive burden on the over-stretched health system'
p13505
aS'some studies have estimated that india stands to lose about 4'
p13506
aS'58 trillion dollars before 2030 due to non communicable diseases and mental health conditions'
p13507
aS'so we must address the question of psychological state of our existence as much as we try to advance our physical and material life'
p13508
aS'this is where the role of yoga is paramount'
p13509
aS'across the world there are moving stories of transformed lives and rekindled hopes due to yoga'
p13510
aS'the prediction of shri aurobindo that indian yoga'
p13511
ag449
ag449
aS'is potentially one of these dynamic elements of the future life of humanity is coming true'
p13512
aS'this discipline was not originally considered or conceived as system of medicine'
p13513
aS'but because yoga is about aholistic lifestyle and the physical mental intellectual emotional moral and spiritual harmony it has profound health benefits'
p13514
aS'it fits well with the change in the way that world increasingly defines health'
p13515
aS'we are no longer satisfied with just preventing and managing diseases'
p13516
aS'people now demand promotion of wellness which is a healthy balance of the mind body and spirit'
p13517
aS'we now increasingly hear voices calling for holistic treatment which means dealing not just with the immediate ailment but with the complete person physically psychologically socially and spiritually'
p13518
aS'traditional indian systems are rooted in looking at human beings in totality'
p13519
aS'they see the link between adhi or problems at the mind level and vyadhi or problems at the physical level'
p13520
aS'they probe deeper causes not just look at symptoms'
p13521
aS'they treat the person not just cure the disease'
p13522
aS'they may at times take longer to take effect but they tend to have deeper and longer impact'
p13523
aS'and they are without side effects'
p13524
aS'as i argued at the science congress this morning like traditional knowledge science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of nature'
p13525
aS'so we must recognize that science as we see it does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world'
p13526
aS'and we must remember that the western system of thought from hippocrates to percival to edison have expressed views on health that are not fundamentally different from the philosophy of the indian system'
p13527
aS'so along with the accumulated wisdom and experience gathered over the ages we must also apply the techniques and methods of modern science to test and validate results assure quality and explain benefits'
p13528
aS'and this is why we are placing emphasis on our efforts to increase awareness acceptance and adoption of ayush system of medicine'
p13529
aS'and in doing so we will create better wellness among people rely more on local resources and reduce healthcare costs'
p13530
aS'we will also reduce the social and economic costs to our society and promote a more environment friendly healthcare system'
p13531
aS'i am not here to advocate the supremacy of one system over another'
p13532
aS'i believe that humanity is wealthier for its diversity'
p13533
aS'civilisations cultures and countries have enriched each other by sharing their knowledge and wisdom'
p13534
aS'and we can progress more by learning from each other'
p13535
aS'it is in this spirit that swami vivekananda called for combining the best from the east and the west'
p13536
aS'so it must be in the area of healthcare'
p13537
aS'my vision for healthcare is an integrated system that understands and builds on the best and most effective of different traditions'
p13538
aS'this is why i deeply appreciate your effort to integrate yoga ayurveda naturopathy unani siddha homeopathy and modern medicine by bringing prominent researchers and doctors on one platform'
p13539
aS'your focus on four major non-communicable diseases - diabetes cancer psychiatric disorders hypertension and cardiovascular diseases is appreciable'
p13540
aS'it addresses issues that are very close to my heart'
p13541
aS'modern systems of medicine have transformed healthcare screening detection and diagnosis of diseases'
p13542
aS'use of technology has reduced barriers to accessing health care and improved our understanding of disease patterns'
p13543
aS'breakthroughs in medicines and vaccines have helped conquer and contain many diseases'
p13544
aS'but as our understanding of its limitation and its side effects have grown as we have experienced the growing costs of modern medicine systems we have begun to look beyond to traditional systems not just in india but in other countries as well'
p13545
aS'their popularity is growing'
p13546
aS'yoga is now a global heritage'
p13547
aS'and the world is embracing traditional indian medicine with great enthusiasm'
p13548
aS'so we look to you at this conference to define the path forward in the service of humanity'
p13549
aS'i hope that health professionals policymakers government organizations and industry will bridge the distance between the various forms of medical systems'
p13550
aS'i hope that you will to integrate yoga and traditional indian medicine more closely into our healthcare system and make wellness a part of life for all in india and rest of the world'
p13551
aS'you will contribute not only to healthier and happier life for people but also to a more prosperous and peaceful world and a more sustainable future for our planet'
p13552
aS'thank you'
p13553
aS'i am delighted that the tokyo foundation is hosting a conclave on the theme of asian values and democracy on january 19 as follow-up of the conclave held by vivekananda international foundation in delhi last year'
p13554
aS'the theme of the two-day conference held in delhi in september 2015 was conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness from the hindu buddhist civilizational perspective'
p13555
aS'it is universally accepted that this century belongs to asia'
p13556
aS'asia is at the crossroads of a very special moment in the history of humanity'
p13557
aS'this is a continent bustling with energy enthusiasm and exuberance driven by the dynamism of a youthful population that is constantly innovating'
p13558
aS'all asian civilizations indic shinto or dao had had a common value system which could avoid conflicts among humans and between humans and nature -- the conflict among states being different'
p13559
aS'that common value system recognizes accepts and even celebrates diversity among humans'
p13560
aS'this is what leads to conflict avoidance as it is founded on harmony in diversity'
p13561
aS'conflict avoidance based on harmonizing the diversity of humans is inherent in asian democracy as its basic value'
p13562
aS'our idea of democracy is not just a game of numbers mediated by the rules of majority and minority as it happens in numerical democracies'
p13563
aS'our democratic approach is founded on consensus'
p13564
aS'it does not rest on the idea of rights alone but also includes duties'
p13565
aS'the indian constitution provides for moral fundamental duties of individuals towards one another and to the creation which sustains us all'
p13566
aS'our idea of democracy is founded on values which recognize the space of not only humans but also of nature -- animals and plants -- which incorporates the principles of environment'
p13567
aS'the inclusion of nature and environment makes our life and approach less anthropocentric and more eco-centric'
p13568
aS'great indian thinkers like maharishi aurobindo swami vivekananda and rabindranath tagore have envisioned asian unity in this higher sense of the term'
p13569
aS'i am sure that with its theme of asian values and democracy the tokyo conclave will enable india and japan to expand articulate and include the concepts of conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness as integral to our larger democratic framework'
p13570
aS'with this i wish the tokyo conclave all success'
p13571
aS'i send my heartiest congratulations to the tokyo foundation and the japanese government for having organized this meeting'
p13572
aS'thank you'
p13573
aS'shri vineet jain distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen i am very happy to be here today'
p13574
aS'the global economy is going through a period of uncertainty'
p13575
aS'at a time like this i am glad that so many participants not only from india but also from abroad have taken the time to come here'
p13576
aS'i am sure all of us in india will benefit from the experience of other countries'
p13577
aS'i will take this opportunity to present to you some of my thoughts on the progress of the indian economy and on the business environment'
p13578
aS'some of you may recall what i have said before - that true reforms are those which result in transformation in the lives of citizens'
p13579
aS'as i have said before my goal is reform to transform'
p13580
aS'let me start with the basics'
p13581
aS'what should be the basic guiding principles of economic policy in any country particularly for the developing countries'
p13582
aS'firstly we have to improve the use of our natural and human resources to increase the value addition we can get from them'
p13583
aS'this means increasing the efficiency in allocation of resources'
p13584
aS'it means greater managerial efficiency'
p13585
aS'it means removing unnecessary controls and distortions'
p13586
aS'secondly we should create new opportunities for citizens to progress and also give them a choice of opportunities'
p13587
aS'opportunity is like oxygen to the aspirational citizen and we are keen that this is never in short supply'
p13588
aS'in simple terms it means sabka saath sabka vikas'
p13589
aS'thirdly we have to increase the quality of life of the common citizen and even more so the quality of life of the poor'
p13590
aS'quality of life may have an economic aspect but it is not economics alone'
p13591
aS'if a government is progressive and runs an honest and efficient administration the biggest beneficiaries are the poor'
p13592
aS'i know from my experience that poor governance hurts the poor more than it hurts others'
p13593
aS'therefore improved governance is as important as economic reform'
p13594
aS'we live in a globally connected world'
p13595
aS'actions of one country affect another'
p13596
aS'such actions are not only based on trade and investment but also in matters of pollution and environment'
p13597
aS'a poet had said that no man is an island'
p13598
aS'today it can be said that no country can live alone'
p13599
aS'it is often said that all politics is local'
p13600
aS'to me all economics is global'
p13601
aS'indeed the distinction between domestic affairs and foreign affairs is increasingly losing relevance'
p13602
aS'for a country in the modern day it is not sufficient that its economic policies should only address its domestic priorities'
p13603
aS'to me indias policies must be such that they make a positive contribution to the rest of the world'
p13604
aS'many of you are aware of the contribution india can make to the global economy at a time of economic stagnation in many parts'
p13605
aS'for the last four quarters india has been the fastest growing large economy in the world'
p13606
aS'in 2014-15 india contributed 7'
p13607
aS'4 of global gdp in purchasing power terms'
p13608
aS'but it contributed 12'
p13609
aS'5 of global growth'
p13610
aS'thus its contribution to growth is 68 higher than its share of the global economy'
p13611
aS'fdi in india has increased by 39 in the last 18 months at a time when global fdi has fallen'
p13612
aS'but a countrys contribution goes beyond economics'
p13613
aS'protecting our planet from climate change is one of the most important tasks for this generation'
p13614
aS'if one country reduces its environmental footprint it creates benefits for all others'
p13615
aS'it is for this reason that in the cop 21 summit india made far reaching commitments towards the larger welfare of the planet'
p13616
aS'in history every country that has grown has increased its per capita emissions footprint'
p13617
aS'we are committed to re-writing that history'
p13618
aS'we are committed to reducing the emission intensity of our gdp by 33 by 2030 even while growing at a fast pace'
p13619
aS'for a country which is already at a very low base of per capita emission this is a very ambitious target'
p13620
aS'we have committed that by 2030 40 of our electric power capacity will be from non-fossil fuel'
p13621
aS'we have also committed to building an additional carbon sink of over 2'
p13622
aS'5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent'
p13623
aS'this will be done by creating additional forest cover by 2030'
p13624
aS'this commitment is from a country with a very low per capita land availability'
p13625
aS'we have taken the lead in launching an international solar alliance involving 121 countries falling between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn'
p13626
aS'this initiative will help many developing countries from africa to south america to take advantage of developments in renewable energy around the world'
p13627
aS'let me now return to the three policy objectives i mentioned'
p13628
aS'i will start with the performance of indian economy'
p13629
aS'economists talk about gdp growth inflation investment and the fiscal deficit as key economic parameters'
p13630
aS'since this government took office growth has increased and inflation has decreased'
p13631
aS'foreign investment has increased and the fiscal deficit has decreased'
p13632
aS'and despite a slow-down in global trade the balance of payments deficit has also decreased'
p13633
aS'yet such broad statistics give only a partial picture of what we are attempting and what we are achieving'
p13634
aS'it is often said the devil is in the detail'
p13635
aS'but i believe that god is in the proper execution of many so-called details'
p13636
aS'it is these so-called details which when done well add up to a big picture'
p13637
aS'you may be interested to know that - indias highest ever urea fertiliser production was achieved in 2015'
p13638
aS'- indias highest ever production of ethanol as blended fuel benefiting sugar cane farmers was in 2015'

aS'- indias highest ever generation of electricity was achieved in 2015 - indias highest ever quantity of cargo handled by major ports was in 2015'
p13642
aS'- indias fastest average turnaround time in ports was in 2015'

p13646
aS'- indias highest ever rank in world bank doing business indicators was achieved in 2015'
p13647
aS'- indias highest ever foreign exchange reserves were achieved in 2015'
p13648
aS'when i give these figures it is important to remember that in the preceding years many of these indicators were moving in the opposite direction'
p13649
aS'not only have many indicators improved but they have improved by large margins'
p13650
aS'for example in 2013-14 the total number of national highway kilometres awarded was about 3500'
p13651
aS'this more than doubled in the first year of this government to nearly 8000 kilometres an all-time high'
p13652
aS'this year we are planning to award 10000 kilometres'
p13653
aS'let me give you more examples of quantum leaps'
p13654
aS'the shipping corporation of india which made a loss of rs'
p13655
aS'275 crores in 2013-14 made a profit of rs'
p13656
aS'201 crores in 2014-15'
p13657
aS'this is a turnaround of rs'
p13658
aS'475 crores in one single year'
p13659
aS'in 2013-14 india accounted for just 0'
p13660
aS'1 of global demand for energy efficient led lighting'
p13661
aS'in 2015-16 it is 12'
p13662
aS'indian led bulbs are now the cheapest and most competitive in the world costing less than a dollar versus a global average of 3 dollars'
p13663
aS'in 2013-14 india commissioned 947 megawatts of solar power plants'
p13664
aS'in 2015-16 this will rise to over 2500 megawatts'
p13665
aS'it is expected to reach 12000 megawatts in 2016-17'
p13666
aS'indias share of the global solar energy market will rise from 2'
p13667
aS'5 in 2014 to 18 in 2016'
p13668
aS'indias contribution here is not merely in increasing the share of clean energy'
p13669
aS'its other contribution is that the huge increase in scale has enabled producers to cut prices benefitting the whole world'
p13670
aS'in 2013-14 16800 kilometres of transmission lines were added'
p13671
aS'in 2014-15 this rose to over 22000 an increase of 32'
p13672
aS'in the power sector as a whole the cost of power has declined by over 30'
p13673
aS'let me turn to the second aspect improving opportunities'
p13674
aS'i believe in the politics of empowerment'
p13675
aS'i believe in empowering the people to improve their own lives'
p13676
aS'we undertook the worlds largest and most successful financial inclusion programme'
p13677
aS'it has brought over two hundred million unbanked people into the banking system'
p13678
aS'in the early days of this programme sceptics felt that these accounts would have no balances'
p13679
aS'you will be surprised to know that today these accounts have a balance exceeding rs'
p13680
aS'thirty thousand crores or over four billion dollars'
p13681
aS'we have also issued a record number of debit cards to them'
p13682
aS'india is now one of the few countries where the market share of an indigenous credit card brand exceeds 33'
p13683
aS'we have introduced a new and comprehensive program of crop insurance'
p13684
aS'this empowers farmers to give their best with the state providing cover against risks beyond the farmers control'
p13685
aS'we have introduced soil health cards to empower our farmers'
p13686
aS'the card will tell every farmer the exact character of his soil'
p13687
aS'this will enable him to increase crop yield reduce over-use of chemical inputs and fertilizer and restore soil health'
p13688
aS'entrepreneurship is one of indias traditional strengths'
p13689
aS'it was sad to see it neglected in the last few years'
p13690
aS'business and profits had become bad words'
p13691
aS'we have changed that'
p13692
aS'we need to value enterprise and hard work not wealth'
p13693
aS'our programs ranging from mudra to start up india and stand-up india provide opportunity to the hard working and to the enterprising'
p13694
aS'in so doing we have placed special emphasis on scheduled castes scheduled tribes other backward classes and women'
p13695
aS'we are empowering them to become masters of their own destinies'
p13696
aS'creating opportunities for cities and towns to grow is very crucial'
p13697
aS'urban areas are an engine of growth'
p13698
aS'a key initiative for urban transformation is the smart city mission'
p13699
aS'the mission has several firsts'
p13700
aS'it is the first time that certain areas in cities will be comprehensively developed in a systematic and qualitative way'
p13701
aS'these areas will act as light houses which will eventually influence the rest of the city'
p13702
aS'it is the first time that there has been such extensive citizen consultation'
p13703
aS'nearly 2'
p13704
aS'5 million people participated through contests discussions polls blogs and talks on the mygov platform'
p13705
aS'this is a major break from the top-down approach to urban planning'
p13706
aS'it is the first time that allocation of funds in a government scheme is done not by decisions of ministers or officers but on the basis of competition'
p13707
aS'this is a good example of competitive and cooperative federalism'
p13708
aS'as i mentioned earlier the role of a government does not end with the economy alone'
p13709
aS'there are many non-economic dimensions which are vital for ensuring the welfare of the citizens'
p13710
aS'good governance is crucial'
p13711
aS'we have taken numerous steps which have transformative potential'
p13712
aS'we have ended the era of high level corruption'
p13713
aS'this is a fact acknowledged by indians and foreigners and by critics and supporters of this government'
p13714
aS'this is not an easy achievement'
p13715
aS'we have ended political interference and crony capitalism in nationalized banks'
p13716
aS'we have for the first time appointed several heads of public sector banks from the private sector'
p13717
aS'transparent auctions have cleaned up the natural resources sector which was riddled with scandals'
p13718
aS'many experts have commented on the need to reduce subsidies'
p13719
aS'the new universal access to banking through the jan dhan yojana has enabled plugging of huge leakages in subsidies'
p13720
aS'in developing countries fuel subsidies are generally very difficult to tackle'
p13721
aS'we have successfully decontrolled cooking gas prices'
p13722
aS'we are now operating the worlds largest direct benefit transfer scheme for cooking gas'
p13723
aS'subsidies are transferred to the bank account of households'
p13724
aS'through electronic verification multiple and bogus connections are eliminated'
p13725
aS'this enables genuine beneficiaries to get what they deserve while eliminating those who are not eligible'
p13726
aS'this has substantially reduced the subsidy'
p13727
aS'another subsidized fuel is kerosene used by the poor for cooking and lighting and distributed by state governments'
p13728
aS'there is clear evidence that a large quantity of subsidized kerosene is misused and diverted'
p13729
aS'we have begun a pilot in thirty three districts where kerosene will be sold at market prices'
p13730
aS'the difference between market price and the subsidized price will be transferred directly to bank accounts of those who are poor'
p13731
aS'the poor will be properly identified through bank accounts and biometric identification through aadhaar'
p13732
aS'this will eliminate duplicate non-eligible and bogus consumers'
p13733
aS'this elimination will reduce the total subsidy'
p13734
aS'we have decided that 75 of the savings from this will be passed on to the states'
p13735
aS'thereby we have encouraged state governments to implement this in all districts'
p13736
aS'the experience of chandigarh shows that this is possible'
p13737
aS'in april 2014 there were 68000 beneficiaries of subsidized kerosene in chandigarh'
p13738
aS'a campaign was launched to issue gas connections to all eligible families'
p13739
aS'10500 new gas connections were issued'
p13740
aS'kerosene quotas were stopped for 42000 families who already had gas connections'
p13741
aS'by 31st march 2016 chandigarh will be declared kerosene-free'
p13742
aS'believe it or not till date the saving achieved in kerosene consumption through this initiative is 73'
p13743
aS'two days ago at a meeting with chief secretaries of the states i was reviewing implementation of various pension schemes'
p13744
aS'i was pleasantly surprised to see that there had been noteworthy reduction in leakage simply by eliminating those who were double counted and who were ineligible'
p13745
aS'in some states a reduction of 12 in subsidies has been achieved without any harm to the poor'
p13746
aS'another major subsidy is on fertilizer'
p13747
aS'a substantial quantity of subsidized urea is diverted illegally to use in the production of chemicals'
p13748
aS'we have introduced a simple but effective technical solution neem-coating of urea'
p13749
aS'the organic neem coating makes the fertilizer unsuitable for diversion'
p13750
aS'we have now achieved 100 neem coating in both domestic and imported urea'
p13751
aS'a significant side benefit has also happened'
p13752
aS'the collection of neem leaves for urea has become a new income earning opportunity for rural women'
p13753
aS'i know that several of you are economists'
p13754
aS'economists generally believe that human beings are rational'
p13755
aS'they believe people will not give up a benefit for which they are entitled'
p13756
aS'last year i gave a call to citizens'
p13757
aS'i asked them to give up their cooking gas subsidies if they felt they were not poor enough to get it'
p13758
aS'we also made a promise'
p13759
aS'every connection given up would be used to give a new gas connection to a poor family'
p13760
aS'poor women in rural india use firewood or biomass and suffer greatly because of smoke'
p13761
aS'this scheme is entirely voluntary'
p13762
aS'you may be surprised to learn that nearly 6'
p13763
aS'5 million people in india have responded to my call'
p13764
aS'it warms my heart to see that so many of them have come forward with no compulsion to benefit the poor and give up their subsidies'
p13765
aS'already over 5 million new connections have been given to the poor'
p13766
aS'it is a sign of the public spirit and the self-respect which prevails among indians and shows the potential of citizen action'
p13767
aS'another example where citizens have responded is in the case of khadi'
p13768
aS'in october 2014 i had appealed to all indians to buy at least one khadi garment'
p13769
aS'in response khadi sales have increased substantially'
p13770
aS'we have taken a creative approach to tackling the problem of loss making power distribution companies'
p13771
aS'under the uday programme short term debt relief is given by state governments taking over bank loans'
p13772
aS'but this is accompanied by strong long term conditions to hold both the distribution companies and the states'
p13773
aS'this will create the conditions for rolling out 24x7 power supply'
p13774
aS'our country suffers from an excess of old and unnecessary laws which obstruct people and businesses'
p13775
aS'we began the exercise of identifying unnecessary laws and repealing them'
p13776
aS'1827 central laws have been identified for repeal'
p13777
aS'out of these 125 have already been repealed'
p13778
aS'bills for repealing another 758 have been passed by the lok sabha and are awaiting the approval of the upper house'
p13779
aS'i have given just a few examples of the potential of improved governance'
p13780
aS'the benefits of improved governance and reduced corruption are lasting and profound'
p13781
aS'if our policies are studied closely you will find that many are popular but none are populist'
p13782
aS'every one of the changes we have made is in the direction of good governance and rationality'
p13783
aS'i have been referring to cooking gas fertilizer and kerosene subsidies'
p13784
aS'i must confess that i am surprised by the way words are used by experts on this matter'
p13785
aS'when a benefit is given to farmers or to the poor experts and government officers normally call it a subsidy'
p13786
aS'however i find that if a benefit is given to industry or commerce it is usually called an incentive or a subvention'
p13787
aS'we must ask ourselves whether this difference in language also reflects a difference in our attitude'
p13788
aS'why is it that subsidies going to the well-off are portrayed in a positive manner'
p13789
aS'let me give you an example'
p13790
aS'the total revenue loss from incentives to corporate tax payers was over rs'
p13791
aS'62000 crores'
p13792
aS'dividends and long term capital gains on shares traded in stock exchanges are totally exempt from income tax even though it is not the poor who earn them'
p13793
aS'since it is exempt it is not even counted in the rs'
p13794
aS'62000 crores'
p13795
aS'double taxation avoidance treaties have in some cases resulted in double non-taxation'
p13796
aS'this also is not counted in the rs'
p13797
aS'62000 crores'
p13798
aS'yet these are rarely referred to by those who seek reduction of subsidies'
p13799
aS'perhaps these are seen as incentives for investment'
p13800
aS'i wonder whether if the fertiliser subsidy is re-named as incentive for agricultural production some experts will view it differently'
p13801
aS'i am not arguing that all subsidies are good'
p13802
aS'my point is that there can not be any ideological position on such matters'
p13803
aS'we have to be pragmatic'
p13804
aS'we have to eliminate bad subsidies whether or not they are called subsidies'
p13805
aS'but some subsidies may be necessary to protect the poor and the needy and give them a fair chance to succeed'
p13806
aS'hence my aim is not to eliminate subsidies but to rationalize and target them'
p13807
aS'in 19 months much has been achieved'
p13808
aS'much more is expected of us'
p13809
aS'and there are challenges ahead'
p13810
aS'yet i am now confident - that we can successfully go forward - that we can successfully go faster - and that we can do so in a way that will benefit the common people'
p13811
aS'when the people of a nation make up their minds to go forward and when the power of the people is with us hard challenges become huge opportunities'
p13812
aS'this confidence of mine is not formed in a vacuum but founded on my experience over the last 19 months'
p13813
aS'we inherited a struggling economy just recovering from a currency crisis'
p13814
aS'in less than two years we have taken india to the top of global league tables of foreign investment and growth'
p13815
aS'friends we have a long way to go but i feel ours is a journey well begun'
p13816
aS'like all long journeys there may be obstacles on the way but i am confident we will reach our destination'
p13817
aS'we have created a platform for a new future and for a new india an india where every child is born safely and maternal and infant mortality are below world averages an india where no person is houseless an india where every town and every village every school and every train every street and every house are clean and sanitary an india where every citizen has access to good health care an india where every village has 24x7 electricity an india where every city is vibrant and livable an india where girls are educated and empowered an india where every boy and every girl is skilled and ready for productive employment an india where agriculture industry and services provide well-paying jobs to all who need them an india where farmers know the nature of their soil have the best inputs and reach global levels of productivity an india where enterprises large and small have access to capital and credit an india where start-ups and other businesses provide innovative solutions an india which is at the forefront of a global digital economy an india which leads the world in clean energy an india where every citizen has basic social security and a pension in old age an india where citizens trust government and are trusted by government'
p13818
aS'and above all a transformed india where all citizens have the opportunity to reach their full potential'
p13819
aS'thank you'
p13820
aS'namaskar distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen'
p13821
aS'i am happy to be present here for the inaugural function of the vision conclave as a part of the global ayurveda festival organized in gods own country - kerala'
p13822
aS'kerala is the hub of traditional ayurveda'
p13823
aS'this is not only due to the long uninterrupted practice of ayurveda in this state but also due to the global popularity of its authentic medicines and therapies and now the vast fast growing network of health resorts and hospitals of ayurveda'
p13824
aS'i have been informed that the five-day global ayurveda festival has turned out to be excellent in terms of participation and projection of the various facets of ayurveda'
p13825
aS'it is heartening to note that foreign delegates in large numbers have come from various countries to participate in the ayurveda festival'
p13826
aS'i am sure their participation in this festival will provide a lot of impetus to the spread of ayurveda'
p13827
aS'in india we have had a long great tradition of saints and hermits who evolved our own indigenous systems of healthcare like ayurveda yoga and siddha'
p13828
aS'over time we also interacted with different civilizations and assimilated other systems of medicine as well'
p13829
aS'all these systems were based on the philosophy of'
p13830
aS'that is all should remain happy all should remain healthy'
p13831
aS'ayurveda is generally defined as science of life by translating ayuh r as life and veda as science'
p13832
aS'sushruta defines health as samdosha samagni samdhatu malakriyah prasannatma indriyas manah swath abhidayate'
p13833
aS'this means that health is balanced when all three doshas or bioenergy and agni or metabolic process are balanced and excretions are in proper order'
p13834
aS'when atman or soul senses manah or intellect are in harmony with internal peace svastha or optimal health is achieved'
p13835
aS'compare this with the definition of health that the world health organization uses health is a complete state of physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'
p13836
aS'so we see how strongly the principles of ayurveda are aligned with the definition of health propagated by the who'
p13837
aS'health is the complete state of well being and not the absence of disease'
p13838
aS'today ayurveda is relevant globally because of its holistic and comprehensive approach to health'
p13839
aS'the ayurvedic dincharya or daily schedule helps to bring about peace and harmony in ones life'
p13840
aS'ayurvedic daily life routines are meant to enhance the total health of a human being both mental and physical'
p13841
aS'what are the great health challenges that the world is facing today'
p13842
aS'non-communicable diseases lifestyle related diseases like hypertension diabetes and cancers have become the greatest health challenges'
p13843
aS'who estimates that non-communicable diseases kill about 38 million people each year and almost three quarters of ncd deaths that is 28 million occur in low and middle-income countries'
p13844
aS'it is in managing these that ayurveda offers solutions'
p13845
aS'the long tradition of saints and hermits who created indian systems of healthcare like ayurveda yoga and siddha believes in a harmonious relationship with nature'
p13846
aS'these systems try to create balance and preserve health through eco-friendly practices and sustainable sourcing of medicinal herbs'
p13847
aS'unfortunately the real potential of ayurveda is untapped because of many reasons'
p13848
aS'most importantly because of inadequate scientific scrutiny and concerns regarding standards and quality'
p13849
aS'if these issues are addressed properly i am sure ayurveda can provide solutions to many health problems'
p13850
aS'india can be a leader in making affordable holistic health care available to the world'
p13851
aS'what can we do and what are we doing to address these issues'
p13852
aS'our government is fully committed to promotion of ayurveda and traditional systems of medicine'
p13853
aS'as soon as this government was formed the department of ayush was upgraded to the status of a full ministry in the government of india'
p13854
aS'the national ayush mission has been started to promote ayush medical systems through cost effective ayush services strengthening of educational systems facilitating the enforcement of quality control of ayurveda siddha and unani homoeopathy drugs and sustainable availability of raw-materials'
p13855
aS'for quality control of ayush drugs steps are being taken to bring regulatory amendments for effective enforcement and strengthening the regulatory framework at the central and state levels'
p13856
aS'creating a vertical structure for ayush drugs in central drug standards control organization control over misleading advertisements and extension of financial support to the states under national ayush mission for quality control activities are important initiatives that are underway'
p13857
aS'to ensure credibility of knowledge and skills of yoga experts a scheme for voluntary certification of yoga professionals has been launched on 22nd june last year during the international conference on yoga for holistic health'
p13858
aS'our policy regarding ayurveda and other indian systems of medicine is already aligned with the traditional medicine strategy 2014-2023 of who which has been adopted in the world health assembly for implementation by 192 member countries of who'
p13859
aS'the who strategy contains methodologies for harnessing the potential contribution of traditional and complementary medicine to health wellness and person-centered healthcare'
p13860
aS'in the words of swami vivekananda therefore we shall- combine the best of east with that of the west'
p13861
aS'modern systems of medicine have strong and effective diagnostic tools that allow us to screen and detect disease early'
p13862
aS'the use of technology in healthcare has the potential to reduce barriers to accessing care and improve our understanding of disease patterns'
p13863
aS'however we do need to look beyond'
p13864
aS'we need to look beyond providing healthcare and engage in the pursuit of good health a combination of physical and mental well being'
p13865
aS'the escalating costs of treatment the side effects of medicines have prompted medical experts to think of widening their horizons to traditional systems of medicine'
p13866
aS'we are committed to promote the use of traditional medicine in our public health system through regulation of research and appropriate integration of quality products practices and practitioners into the health system'
p13867
aS'our efforts are to tap the real potential of ayurveda and other ayush systems in imparting preventive promotive and holistic healthcare to the people'
p13868
aS'we will maximize the utilization of ayurveda and yoga and other traditions of healing in accordance with their genius and acumen and help promotion of integrative medical facilities'
p13869
aS'young entrepreneurs who are planning a start-up could find a lot of opportunities in holistic healthcare'
p13870
aS'in the context of health sector planning while we think of the utility and contemporary relevance of ayurveda and other traditional medical systems it is also important to ponder over the realities and the challenges faced by these systems'
p13871
aS'traditional medicine is affordable to many of the rural people'
p13872
aS'it is locally available to the communities time-tested for its safety and efficacy'
p13873
aS'above all it imbibes the culture and eco-system of the communities within which it grows'
p13874
aS'in many parts of developing countries traditional medical practices are the only resources of healthcare within the physical and financial reach of the poor people'
p13875
aS'it is therefore even more important that we ensure the quality of these systems'
p13876
aS'all stakeholders of ayurveda gathered here must agree that it is important for us to address the issues of safety efficacy quality access and rational use of our traditional medical knowledge of ayurveda'
p13877
aS'we should also move closely with the emerging trends in the areas of bio-medicine health technology and information technology'
p13878
aS'i know that there have been great efforts in china to develop and establish policies and regulations for promoting the safe use of traditional chinese medicine which comprises a large chunk of the international trade of complementary and alternative medicine'
p13879
aS'we will learn from the experience of other countries and ensure that ayurveda and other indian systems are propagated and popularised'
p13880
aS'i am also told that the delhi declaration on traditional medicine adopted by the south east asian countries in february 2013 and later resolved by the who regional committee seeks member countries to follow harmonized approaches for developmental activities of traditional medicine'
p13881
aS'i hope proper implementation of articles of the delhi declaration will help to achieve systematic development of traditional medicine including ayurveda as well at national regional and global level'
p13882
aS'we would like to offer our institutions as referral centres for training capacity building and information technology exchange programs in ayurveda and other ayush systems'
p13883
aS'our leadership on these fronts can be sustained only with concerted efforts for rendering quality healthcare and education and by producing competent professionals'
p13884
aS'ladies and gentlemen as you are well aware india has a long history and rich heritage of ayurveda and yoga'
p13885
aS'the multi-cultural origins of ayurvedic knowledge are revealed in the classical texts themselves'
p13886
aS'both charaka samhita and sushruta samhita urge physicians to seek the help of cowherds hunters and forest-dwellers for procuring medicinal plants'
p13887
aS'in the charaka samhita we notice the participation and contribution of a central asian physician in one of the assemblies of scholars gathered to formulate the principles of ayurveda'
p13888
aS'the three major classical texts give importance to buddhist moral values'
p13889
aS'vagbhata who is said to be the author of one of the classical texts ashtangahridayam was a buddhist'
p13890
aS'it is evident therefore that these traditions grew by sharing knowledge both locally as well as across cultures'
p13891
aS'they learnt from the most humble as well as those with arcane knowledge'
p13892
aS'we will continue this effort'
p13893
aS'we will share the knowledge of our systems with the world and continue to enrich our traditions by learning from other systems'
p13894
aS'the global ayurveda festival takes this vision forward'
p13895

p14482
aS'we should pursue our dreams and stay focused'

p14495
aS'on this last day i will not ask you to do exercise or run for 3 or 5 kilometers'

aS'but what is your routine especially during exams is important'
p14497
aS'during all 365 days out routine should be according to our dreams and commitments'
p14498
aS'i agree with what shri prabhakar reddy has said'
p14499
aS'he has suggested that students should sleep on time and should do revision after getting up early'
p14500
aS'students should reach examination centre before time with admit card and other essential things'
p14501
aS'shri prabhakar reddy has said this and i may not have said this'
p14502
aS'because i am little unconcerned regarding sleep'
p14503
aS'my friends also keep telling me that i sleep very less'
p14504
aS'i will try to do something about it'
p14505
aS'but i definitely agree with this'
p14506
aS'stipulated time to sleep sound sleep are equally important as your other day-to-day activities'
p14507
aS'and this is possible'
p14508
aS'i am fortunate that i sleep less but it is very sound'
p14509
aS'and it is enough too for me'
p14510
aS'but i will request you'
p14511
aS'some people have a habit of talking on phone for long time before sleeping and those thoughts occupy their mind so how will they sleep'
p14512
aS'when i ask you to sleep i am not asking to sleep only for exams'
p14513
aS'to write well in exams i am asking you to sleep tension-free'
p14514
aS'i am not asking to keep on sleeping'
p14515
aS'it shouldnt happen that when you score less and your mother asks the reason you tell that modi ji asked me to sleep and i slept'
p14516
aS'i hope you will not do that'
p14517
aS'in life discipline is a big reason behind strong foundation of successes'
p14518
aS'discipline provides a strong foundation'
p14519
aS'unorganized and undisciplined people who complete days work in evening think that they have done the job but so much of energy is wasted and there is tension every moment'
p14520
aS'in our body also even if one part is paining the whole body does not feel comfortable'
p14521
aS'not only that our routine also gets disturbed'
p14522
aS'any that is why we should not consider any thing small'
p14523
aS'you should never compromise on your decisions'
p14524
aS'decide and try to do it'
p14525
aS'friends i have seen two types of students who appear in exams'
p14526
aS'one is who concentrates on his strengths and learning'
p14527
aS'second types of students doubt their abilities and worry too much about their question paper'
p14528
aS'you would have seen these two types of people'
p14529
aS'concern about the paper has a negative impact on results too'
p14530
aS'the one who is confident about whatever he has learnt is able to handle anything that comes up'
p14531
aS'someone who can say this better than me is chess champion shri vishwanathan anand'
p14532
aS'he will share his experiences and tell you how to check-mate in exams hello this is viswanathan anand'
p14533
aS'first of all let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams'
p14534
aS'i will next talk a little bit about how i went to my exams and my experiences for that'
p14535
aS'i found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life'
p14536
aS'you need to be well rested get a good nights sleep you need to be on a full stomach you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm'
p14537
aS'it is very very similar to a game of chess'
p14538
aS'when you play you dont know which pawn will appear just like in a class you dont know which question will appear in an exam'
p14539
aS'so if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment'
p14540
aS'so stay calm'
p14541
aS'it is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself dont keep your expectations too high'
p14542
aS'just see it as a challenge do i remember what i was taught during the year can i solve these problems'
p14543
aS'at the last minute just go over the most important things and the things you feel the topics you feel you dont remember very well'
p14544
aS'you may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter'
p14545
aS'if you revise the questions you find difficult you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam you will be able to deal with them much better'
p14546
aS'so stay calm get a good nights sleep dont be over-confident but dont be pessimistic either'
p14547
aS'i have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before'
p14548
aS'so stay confident and all the very best to you'
p14549
aS'vishwanathan anand has really said a very important thing and you would also have seen him playing international matches with good health'
p14550
aS'he plays with so much concentration and does not even move his eyes'
p14551
aS'we used to hear about arjuna how he used to concentrate on the birds eye'
p14552
aS'similarly vishwanathan anands eyes are fixed on target when he plays and that is expression of the inner peace'
p14553
aS'it is difficult to say whether we will get inner peace just by someones words'
p14554
aS'but we should strive for that smilingly'
p14555
aS'even during exams if we smile and laugh we will start experiencing the inner peace'
p14556
aS'you cant have inner peace when you are not talking to friends walking alone trying to read so many books at the last moment'
p14557
aS'laugh with your friends'
p14558
aS'share jokes'
p14559
aS'you will feel peaceful environment automatically'
p14560
aS'i want to share a small thing with you'
p14561
aS'just imagine you are standing at a pond and you are getting a nice view of the water but suddenly if someone throws a stone in it'
p14562
aS'now the nice view which you were getting will not be there anymore'
p14563
aS'if water is still no matter how deep are the things they look clear'
p14564
aS'but if water is not still then nothing is visible inside'
p14565
aS'there is a lot inside you labour of the whole year'
p14566
aS'but if your mind is not at peace then you cant find that treasure'
p14567
aS'if you have a peaceful mind then you will be able to use your treasure of knowledge and exam will become very easy'
p14568
aS'i want to tell you something about myself'
p14569
aS'when i go to attend some lecture or in the government also there are subjects i need to concentrate hard'
p14570
aS'when i try to understand by concentrating more then i feel an inner pressure'
p14571
aS'then i realize that i need to relax a bit'
p14572
aS'then i developed a technique of deep breathing and take 3-5 deep breaths'
p14573
aS'it takes me around 3040 or 50 seconds but then my mind becomes calm and ready to understand the matter'
p14574
aS'this is my experience and may work for you too'
p14575
aS'shri rajat aggarwl has written a good thing on my app'
p14576
aS'he said we should relax with friends family for at least half an hour every day'
p14577
aS'this is a very important thing said by shri rajat'
p14578
aS'most of the times when we come back from exam we start calculating about right and wrong answers'
p14579
aS'and if parents are educated and more so if teachers then they ask the exact answers'
p14580
aS'they calculate whether you will score 4080 or 90 marks'
p14581
aS'your mind is still entangled in the exam that is already over'
p14582
aS'you also share with friends about the answers'
p14583
aS'we get entangled in that only'
p14584
aS'friends please do not do this'
p14585
aS'once an exam is over its over'
p14586
aS'chat with your family on other subjects remember old memories'
p14587
aS'try to remember the scenes of a location you had visited with your parents'
p14588
aS'spend half an hour on this'
p14589
aS'what shri rajat has said is absolutely correct'
p14590
aS'friends what can i tell you about peace'
p14591
aS'today before you take your exams one such person has sent you his message who himself is a teacher'

p14596
aS'my advice to all the students is that at the time of examination you unburden your mind and with a clear calm and concentrated mind take the exam'
p14597
aS'and then accept whatever situation comes'
p14598
aS'my view is that by accepting the situation as it is we can be more happy and peaceful'
p14599

aS'i feel proud that there is so much curiosity about yoga'
p14608
aS'how many people on my mobile app shri atanu mandal sri kunal gupta shri shashank kumar shri k g anand shri abhijeet kulkarni innumerable such people have referred to yoga and meditation'
p14609
aS'i do not say that you start practicing yoga from tomorrow that will be injustice with you however those who practice it should not stop it just because of exams'
p14610
aS'however it is true that be it student life or latter part of life yoga is an important key for the development of conscience'
p14611
aS'and it is a key which is most accessible and simple'

p14776
aS'the youth of the country should be able to face global challenges and should get opportunities in education'
p14777
aS'but due to archaic laws and regulations education has suffered a lot and in order to improve it 10 public and 10 private institutions will be raised to global standards after selection through a challenge route'
p14778
aS'these institutes will be provided financial aid as well'

aS'i am delighted to address the international workshop on rule of law and sustainable development'
p14795
aS'i welcome our friends from abroad and thank them for their active participation'
p14796
aS'this workshop is being organized soon after two important international agreements which happened during 2015'
p14797
aS'one is the paris agreement on climate change'
p14798
aS'the other is the agreement on sustainable development goals'
p14799
aS'therefore this conference provides a timely and useful opportunity to discuss the way forward'
p14800
aS'this is important not only in the national context but also in the global context'
p14801
aS'i hope you will keep in mind the welfare of mankind and the concerns of the international community in your deliberations'
p14802
aS'the role of rules and laws in achieving sustainable development goals is going to be very important in the days to come'
p14803
aS'however rules should be such that they facilitate the achievement of these goals'
p14804
aS'unfortunately some times the concern for environment is defined narrowly'
p14805
aS'we all have to realize that if there is conflict no ones purpose will be served'
p14806
aS'i hope that you will show us the way to build and ensure climate justice across the globe based on legal as well as social frameworks'
p14807
aS'last year in september i attended the meeting of the un general assembly where the sustainable development goals for 2030 were adopted'
p14808
aS'these goals reflect our evolving understanding of the social economic and environmental linkages that define our lives'
p14809
aS'this was followed by the cop-21 where we contributed significantly in shaping the narrative'
p14810
aS'our commitments at cop-21 underline the indian ethos which aims at changing human lifestyle along with changes in the manner in which we engage in economic activity'
p14811
aS'the problems of environment are largely the effect of our consumptive lifestyles'
p14812
aS'if we want to make a meaningful impact we all need to look within before we read the books of law'
p14813
aS'friends'
p14814
aS'i have always felt that anything which is not sustainable can not be called development'
p14815
aS'in our culture development means and'
p14816
aS'this can not happen unless the development process is inclusive and sustainable'
p14817
aS'anything which compromises on the ability of future generations to meet their requirements can not be called development'
p14818
aS'we in india have always believed in sustainability'
p14819
aS'for us the law of nature holds great value'
p14820
aS'if we all observe it then many man-made laws will not be required'
p14821
aS'only the practice of and will be enough to help us'
p14822
aS'in modern terminology there is a word called stakeholder'
p14823
aS'a path becomes sustainable if all stakeholders are benefitted'
p14824
aS'however i must add a word of caution here'
p14825
aS'the stake should be natural'
p14826
aS'it should be inherent'
p14827
aS'it can not be stretched to include those who may be working with ulterior motives'
p14828
aS'nature is pure'
p14829
aS'hence only pure intentions can keep it intact'
p14830
aS'we in india have a strong tradition of living in harmony with nature'
p14831
aS'we worship nature'
p14832
aS'we worship the sun the moon rivers land trees animals rain air and fire'
p14833
aS'these elements of nature have been given the stature of gods in our culture'
p14834
aS'moreover in indian mythology most of the gods and goddesses are associated with an animal and a tree'
p14835
aS'thus respect for nature is an integral part of our culture and has been passed across generations'
p14836
aS'protection of environment comes naturally to us'
p14837
aS'this strong tradition has been a guiding principle for all of us'
p14838
aS'there is a well-known sanskrit saying which means we always pray for welfare peace fulfillment and sustainability of all at all places and for all times'
p14839
aS'this is our commitment not of today but since time immemorial'
p14840
aS'if we remember this follow this and act accordingly india could provide leadership in sustainable development'
p14841
aS'for example the practice of yoga is aimed at balancing contentment and worldly desires to lead to a path of moderation and sustainable lifestyle'
p14842
aS'when i talk of yoga it is not just its physical dimension'
p14843
aS'yoga is very comprehensive'
p14844
aS'the ideas of yam niyam pratyahar teach us discipline austerity and control'
p14845
aS'much before the debate on sustainable development began mahatma gandhi the father of our nation had said that we should act as trustees and use natural resources wisely'
p14846
aS'it is our moral responsibility to ensure that we leave a healthy planet for future generations'
p14847
aS'friends'
p14848
aS'i am sure all of us agree that poverty is the biggest challenge for environment'
p14849
aS'therefore eradication of poverty is one of the fundamental goals of my government'
p14850
aS'guided by our core values we are working towards achieving this goal with sincerity'
p14851
aS'we want to ensure a conducive environment for 1'
p14852
aS'25 billion indians to develop and prosper'
p14853
aS'we are encouraging education skill development digital connectivity and entrepreneurship to provide an enabling ecosystem for our youth to blossom'
p14854
aS'we aim to do all this in a sustainable manner'
p14855
aS'we realize that fulfilling the demand for energy is vital to the achievement of our development goals'
p14856
aS'this is why one of the first challenges that we took up was generation of 175 giga watts of renewable energy'
p14857
aS'we are well on our way to achieving this objective'
p14858
aS'we have also taken up the swacch bharat and clean ganga initiatives'
p14859
aS'i am happy to note that millions of people across the country have joined the cleanliness drive'
p14860
aS'i take this opportunity to invite the participants to explore as to how we can strengthen this collective endeavour'
p14861
aS'i am glad to learn that this workshop will also discuss issues related to pollution and waste management'
p14862
aS'these are issues that need to be addressed proactively'
p14863
aS'i look forward to your recommendations towards strengthening such initiatives'
p14864
aS'friends'
p14865
aS'the problems we face in india today are not unique'
p14866
aS'other civilizations have also faced similar problems and were able to overcome them'
p14867
aS'i believe that through our collective efforts we will succeed as well'
p14868
aS'while doing so we must ensure that we avoid contradictions between our need to develop and develop sustainably'
p14869
aS'our culture teaches us union between the and'
p14870
aS'if we become one with the universal order there are no conflicts of interest'
p14871
aS'therefore my government is treating the challenge of adapting to climate change as an opportunity rather than a problem'
p14872
aS'we need to adopt the philosophy of'
p14873
aS'we must do things in a way that causes minimum damage to the environment'
p14874
aS'this is or mastery'
p14875
aS'this is what i mean when i talk of zero defect and zero effect manufacturing'
p14876
aS'i have written some of my thoughts on this theme in my book convenient action continuity for change'
p14877
aS'friends'
p14878
aS'the rule of law dictates that no one can be punished for anothers misdeed'
p14879
aS'we need to recognize that there are many people who are least responsible for the problem of climate change'
p14880
aS'they are also the people who still wait for access to modern amenities'
p14881
aS'they face the adverse impact of climate change more than anyone else'
p14882
aS'this includes cyclones droughts floods heat waves and rising sea levels'
p14883
aS'the poor vulnerable and marginalized groups have fewer resources to cope with climate disasters'
p14884
aS'unfortunately their present and future generations are also burdened by laws and agreements on environment'
p14885
aS'that is why i talk about climate justice'
p14886
aS'moreover the rules laws practices and principles of one country can not be applied to another uniformly'
p14887
aS'every country has its own challenges and its own ways of dealing with them'
p14888
aS'if we apply the same set of rules for all countries and for all people it will not work'
p14889
aS'sustainable development is our responsibility'
p14890
aS'i am confident that we can achieve it collectively'
p14891
aS'i am also confident that we can find ways for development which are in harmony with nature'
p14892
aS'we can find them along the road travelled by our forefathers'
p14893
aS'i hope the deliberations during this workshop will help in developing a shared understanding of these imperatives'
p14894
aS'i wish this conference a grand success'
p14895
aS'thank you'
p14896
aS'madam lagarde my cabinet colleague shri jaitley ladies and gentlemen i warmly welcome you all to india and to delhi'
p14897
aS'delhi is a city with a rich heritage and has several historical landmarks'
p14898
aS'i hope you will have time to see some of them'
p14899
aS'i am very happy that the imf has collaborated with us in organizing this conference'
p14900
aS'madam lagarde this event is another example of your fondness for india and asia'
p14901
aS'i congratulate you on being appointed as managing director for a second term'
p14902
aS'this reflects the confidence the world has in your understanding of the global economy and your ability to lead this institution'
p14903
aS'madam lagarde the long pending quota revisions agreed in 2010 have finally come into effect'
p14904
aS'the quotas of emerging countries will now better reflect their weight in the world economy'
p14905
aS'this will give them more say in collective decisions in the imf'
p14906
aS'you have demonstrated exceptional leadership in managing the tensions that emerged due to the delay'
p14907
aS'you played a major role in finally persuading all members to ratify the decisions taken in 2010'
p14908
aS'i am sure the imf will be able to build on this success'
p14909
aS'reform of global institutions has to be an on-going process'
p14910
aS'it must reflect changes in the global economy and the rising share of emerging economies'
p14911
aS'even now imf quotas do not reflect the global economic realities'
p14912
aS'change in quotas is not an issue of increasing the power of certain countries'
p14913
aS'it is an issue of fairness and legitimacy'
p14914
aS'the belief that quotas can be changed is essential for the fairness of the system'
p14915
aS'for poor nations to respect the legitimacy of such institutions they must be able to aspire and to hope'
p14916
aS'i am therefore very happy that the imf has decided to finalize the next round of quota changes by october 2017'
p14917
aS'india has always had great faith in multi-lateralism'
p14918
aS'we believe that as the world becomes more complex the role of multilateral institutions will increase'
p14919
aS'some of you may not be aware that india was represented at the bretton woods conference in 1944 which gave birth to the imf'
p14920
aS'indias delegate was mr r'
p14921
aS'k'
p14922
aS'shanmukham chetty who later became independent indias first finance minister'
p14923
aS'our ties therefore are more than seventy years old'
p14924
aS'we are a founding member of the asian infrastructure investment bank and the new development bank'
p14925
aS'we are confident that these banks will play an important role in the development of asia'
p14926
aS'the fund has built up an immense stock of economic expertise'
p14927
aS'all its members should take advantage of this'
p14928
aS'all of us need to pursue policies that provide a stable macro economy enhance growth and further inclusion'
p14929
aS'the fund can be of great assistance in this'
p14930
aS'apart from advice the imf can help in building capacity for policy making'
p14931
aS'i am happy to announce a new partnership with bangladesh bhutan maldives nepal sri lanka india and the imf'
p14932
aS'we have agreed to set up the south asia regional training and technical assistance centre'
p14933
aS'the centre will provide training to government and public sector employees'
p14934
aS'it will enhance their skills and improve the quality of their policy inputs'
p14935
aS'it will also provide technical assistance to governments and public institutions'
p14936
aS'let me now turn to the theme of this conference'
p14937
aS'i will touch on two issues firstly why asia'
p14938
aS'and secondly how india'
p14939
aS'why is asia so important and how can india contribute'
p14940
aS'many knowledgeable people have said that the twenty first century is and will be the asian century'
p14941
aS'three out of every five people in the world live in asia'
p14942
aS'its share in global output and trade is now close to one-third'
p14943
aS'its share in global foreign direct investment is about forty percent'
p14944
aS'it has also been one of the worlds most dynamic regions'
p14945
aS'although asia has slowed down it is still growing at a rate three times greater than that of the advanced countries'
p14946
aS'it is therefore the ray of hope for global economic recovery'
p14947
aS'when we think about asia we must recognize that it is distinct in many ways'
p14948
aS'for example the theme of this conference is investing for the future'
p14949
aS'asian families tend naturally to save more than people in other parts of the world'
p14950
aS'thus they invest for the future'
p14951
aS'economists have commented on the savings ethic of asian countries'
p14952
aS'asians tend to save to buy a house rather than borrow to buy a house'
p14953
aS'many asian countries have relied more on developmental financial institutions and banks than on capital markets'
p14954
aS'this provides an alternative model for the financial sector'
p14955
aS'social stability built on strong family values is another feature of asias development'
p14956
aS'asians tend to leave things behind for the next generation'
p14957
aS'madam lagarde you are one of the worlds top women leaders'
p14958
aS'you will be interested in another unique feature of asia which is rarely commented upon which is the large number of women leaders'
p14959
aS'india sri lanka bangladesh pakistan indonesia thailand korea myanmar and philippines all of these countries have had women as national leaders'
p14960
aS'asia has done so to a much greater degree than other continents'
p14961
aS'today four large states of india west bengal tamil nadu gujarat and rajasthan are headed by democratically elected women'
p14962
aS'the speaker of the lower house of parliament in india is also a woman'
p14963
aS'india has a special place in asia'
p14964
aS'it has historically contributed to asia in several ways'
p14965
aS'buddhism spread to china japan and other parts of south east asia from india'
p14966
aS'it has had a lasting influence on the continents culture'
p14967
aS'kingdoms in the south and west of india have engaged in maritime trade with other parts of asia for over a thousand years'
p14968
aS'the indian national movement showed other asian countries that freedom from colonial rule could be achieved without violence'
p14969
aS'it also demonstrated clearly that the sense of nationhood could be broad and inclusive'
p14970
aS'it need not be defined by narrow linguistic or religious identities'
p14971
aS'the sanskrit saying vasudhaiva kutumbakam the world is one family - refers to this sense of the oneness of all identities'
p14972
aS'india has dispelled the myth that democracy and rapid economic growth can not go together'
p14973
aS'indias growth rate of over seven per cent is being achieved in a country that is also a vibrant democracy'
p14974
aS'it is sometimes assumed that democracy is a colonial gift to india'
p14975
aS'but historians tell us that india had produced forms of democratic self governance many centuries ago when democracy was unknown in many parts of the world'
p14976
aS'india has also shown that a large diverse country can be managed in a way that can promote economic growth and maintain social stability'
p14977
aS'one way in which we are doing this is through cooperative and competitive federalism'
p14978
aS'the states and the centre come together to pursue common objectives'
p14979
aS'states which pursue good policies and deliver essential services for the poor induce others to follow'
p14980
aS'our rapid economic growth is also very distinct in asia'
p14981
aS'we have never tried to gain in trade at the expense of our partners'
p14982
aS'we do not follow beggar thy neighbour macro-economic policies'
p14983
aS'we have never undervalued our exchange rate'
p14984
aS'we add to world and asian demand by running current account deficits'
p14985
aS'we are therefore good asian and good global economic citizens and a source of demand to our trading partners'
p14986
aS'we all want asia to succeed'
p14987
aS'i firmly believe that india can contribute to asian prosperity and development by being economically strong'
p14988
aS'amid global problems i am happy to say that india is a haven of macro-economic stability and a beacon of hope dynamism and opportunity'
p14989
aS'madam lagarde you have referred to india as the bright spot in the global economy'
p14990
aS'i view this as a great privilege and at the same time a major responsibility'
p14991
aS'let me outline our achievements in the last few months and our priorities for the period ahead'
p14992

aS'as it enriched itself it also enriched the world'
p15063
aS'it set once again an enduring lesson of human history it is through openness and enquiry engagement and accommodation and respect for diversity that humanity advances nations progress and the world prospers'
p15064
aS'and this is the message of sufism one of the greatest contributions of islam to this world'
p15065
aS'from its origins in egypt and west asia sufism travelled to distant lands holding aloft the banner of faith and the flag of human values learning from spiritual thoughts of other civilisations and attracting people with the life and message of its saints'
p15066
aS'in the different settings of saharan africa or in southeast asia in turkey or in central asia in iran or india sufism reflected the universal human desire to go beyond the practice and precepts of religion for a deeper unity with the almighty'
p15067
aS'and in that spiritual and mystical enquiry sufis experienced the universal message of almighty that perfection in human life is reflected in the qualities that are dear to god'
p15068
aS'that all are creations of god and that if we love god we must also love all his creations'
p15069
aS'as hazrat nizamuddin auliya said almighty holds dear those who love him for the sake of human beings and those who love human beings for the sake of almighty'
p15070
aS'this is the message of oneness of humanity of all of almightys creations'
p15071
aS'for the sufis therefore service to god meant service to humanity'
p15072
aS'in the words of khwaja moinuddin chishti of all the worships the worship that pleases the almighty god the most is the grant of relief to the humble and the oppressed'

aS'in a beautiful imagery of human values he said human beings must have the affection of the sun the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth because they benefit us all without discrimination and distinction among people'

p15075
aS'above all sufism is a celebration of diversity and pluralism expressed in the words of hazrat nizamuddin auliya that every people has its own path of truth beliefs and focus of reverence'
p15076
aS'these words reflect the divine message to the holy prophet that there is no compulsion in religion and also that to every people we have appointed ways of worship which they observe'
p15077
aS'and it is in harmony with the soul of the bhakti saints saying in the hindu tradition into the bosom of the one great sea flow streams that come from hills on every side'
p15078
aS'and in the wisdom of bulleh shah lord is mixed in every heart'
p15079

p15080
aS'this is the reality of nature'
p15081
aS'we learn this wisdom in the perfect balance and harmony that exists in the vast diversity of a forest'
p15082
aS'its message is beyond the confines of schools and sects'
p15083
aS'its a spiritual quest that traces its origin from the holy prophet and the fundamental values of islam which literally means peace'
p15084
aS'and it reminds us that when we think of the 99 names of allah none stand for force and violence and that the first two names denote compassionate and merciful'
p15085
aS'allah is rahman and raheem'
p15086
aS'sufism is the voice of peace co-existence compassion and equality a call to universal brotherhood'
p15087
aS'and just as india became a principal center of islamic civilization our nation also emerged as one of the most vibrant hubs of sufism'
p15088
aS'sufism became the face of islam in india even as it remained deeply rooted in the holy quran and hadis'
p15089
aS'sufism blossomed in indias openness and pluralism'
p15090
aS'it engaged with her spiritual tradition and evolved its own indian ethos'
p15091
aS'and it helped shape a distinct islamic heritage of india'

aS'we see this heritage in the fields of art architecture and culture that is part of the fabric of our nation and our collective daily lives'

p15097
aS'sufisms contribution to poetry in india is huge'
p15098
aS'its impact on the development of indian music is profound'
p15099
aS'none had a greater impact than the sufi poet-musician amir khusrau'
p15100
aS'eight centuries later his poetry and musical innovation continue to be part of the soul of hindustani music'
p15101
aS'no one had spoken of indian music with such passion as he had'
p15102
aS'who else could have expressed love for india so beautifully as he did but india from head to toe is a picture of heaven adam came from the palace of paradise he could only be sent to an orchard of fruits that is india'
p15103
aS'if india is not paradise how could it be made the abode of the peacock the bird of paradise'
p15104
aS'it is this spirit of sufism the love for their country and the pride in their nation that define the muslims in india'
p15105
aS'they reflect the timeless culture of peace diversity and equality of faith of our land they are steeped in the democratic tradition of india confident of their place in the country and invested in the future of their nation and above all they are shaped by the values of the islamic heritage of india'
p15106
aS'it upholds the highest ideals of islam and has always rejected the forces of terrorism and extremism'
p15107
aS'now as they travel to different parts of the world they are the ambassadors of the values and traditions of our nation'
p15108
aS'as a nation we stood against colonialism and in our struggle for freedom'
p15109
aS'at the dawn of independence some chose to go away and i believe that it also had to do with the colonial politics of that time'
p15110
aS'the tallest of our leaders such as maulana azad and important spiritual leaders such as maulana hussain madani and millions and millions of ordinary citizens rejected the idea of division on the basis of religion'
p15111
aS'now india is moving forward on the strength of the struggles the sacrifices the bravery the knowledge the skill the art and the pride of every member of every faith in our diverse and yet united nation'
p15112
aS'like the strings of sitar that each produces a note but come together to create a beautiful melody'
p15113
aS'this is the spirit of india'
p15114
aS'this is the strength of our nation'
p15115
aS'all our people hindus muslims sikhs christians jains buddhists the micro-minority of parsis believers non-believers are an integral part of india'
p15116
aS'just as it once came to india today sufism from india has spread across the world'
p15117
aS'but this tradition that evolved in india belongs to the whole of south asia'
p15118
aS'that is why i urge others in the region to nurture and revive this glorious heritage of ours'
p15119
aS'when the spiritual love of sufism not the violent force of terrorism flows across the border this region will be the paradise on earth that amir khusrau spoke about'
p15120
aS'let me paraphrase what i have said before terrorism divides and destroys us'
p15121
aS'indeed when terrorism and extremism have become the most destructive force of our times the message of sufism has global relevance'
p15122
aS'in the centres of conflict in west asia to calm cities in distant countries in the remote villages of africa to the towns in our own region terrorism is a daily threat'
p15123
aS'each day brings us terrible news and horrifying images - of schools turned into graveyards of innocence - of prayer gatherings turned into funeral processions - of call to prayer or azaan drowned by the sound of explosion - of blood on the beach massacres in malls and smouldering cars on streets - of thriving cities ruined and priceless heritage destroyed - and of parents bearing coffins entire communities dislocated millions displaced and refugees caught between fire and stormy seas'
p15124
aS'in this digital century of new promise and opportunities the reach of terror is growing and its toll is rising every year'
p15125
aS'since the beginning of this century tens of thousands of families have lost their loved ones in thousands of terrorist incidents globally'
p15126
aS'last year alone i am talking about 2015 over 90 countries experienced terrorist attacks'
p15127
aS'parents in 100 countries live with the daily pain of their children lost to the battlefields of syria'
p15128
aS'and in a globally mobile world one incident can claim citizens of many nations'
p15129
aS'every year we spend over 100 billion dollars on securing the world from terrorism money that should have been spent on building lives of the poor'
p15130
aS'the impact can not be fully captured in statistics alone'
p15131
aS'it is changing the way we live'
p15132
aS'there are forces and groups that are instruments of state policy and design'
p15133
aS'there are others recruited to the cause in misguided belief'
p15134
aS'there are some who are trained in organized camps'
p15135
aS'there are those who find their inspiration in the borderless world of cyber space'
p15136
aS'terrorism uses diverse motivations and causes none of which can be justified'
p15137
aS'terrorists distort a religion whose cause they profess to support'
p15138
aS'they kill and destroy more in their own land and among their own people than they do elsewhere'
p15139
aS'and they are putting entire regions to peril and making the world more insecure and violent'
p15140
aS'the fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion'
p15141
aS'it can not be'
p15142
aS'it is a struggle between the values of humanism and the forces of inhumanity'
p15143
aS'it is not a conflict to be fought only through military intelligence or diplomatic means'
p15144
aS'it is also a battle that must be won through the strength of our values and the real message of religions'
p15145
aS'as i have said before we must reject any link between terrorism and religion'
p15146
aS'those who spread terror in the name of religion are anti-religious'
p15147
aS'and we must advance the message of sufism that stands for the principles of islam and the highest human values'
p15148
aS'this is a task that states societies sages scholars and families must pursue'
p15149
aS'however to me the message of sufism is not just confined to combating terrorism'
p15150
aS'the values of harmony welfare compassion and love for human beings are the foundation of a just society'
p15151
aS'that is the principle behind my creed of sab ka saath sab ka vikaas'
p15152
aS'and these values are important to preserve and nurture diversity in our societies'
p15153
aS'diversity is a basic reality of nature and source of richness of a society and it should not be a cause of discord'
p15154
aS'we need just not constitutional provisions or legal safeguards but also social values to build an inclusive and peaceful society in which everyone belongs secure about his rights and confident of her future'
p15155
aS'this is also a time of great flux and transition in the world'
p15156
aS'the middle of the last century was an important turning point in history'
p15157
aS'a new world order emerged'
p15158
aS'many new nations were born'
p15159
aS'at the beginning of a new century we are at yet another point of transformation on a scale rarely seen in human history'
p15160
aS'in many parts of the world there is uncertainty about the future and how to deal with it as nations and societies'
p15161
aS'these are precisely the times that the world is most vulnerable to violence and conflicts'
p15162
aS'the global community must be more vigilant than ever before and counter the forces of darkness with the radiant light of human values'
p15163
aS'so let us remember the teaching of holy quran that if anyone slew one innocent person it would be as if he slew a whole people if anyone saved one life it would be as if he saved a whole people'
p15164
aS'let us be inspired by the message of hazrat moinuddin chishti with your spiritual light dissolve the clouds of discord and war and spread goodwill peace and harmony among the people'
p15165
aS'let us remember the infinite humanism in sufi poet jalaluddin rumis words contain all human faces in your own without any judgment of them'
p15166
aS'let us also live the sermon of bible that calls us to do good seek peace and pursue it'
p15167
aS'and oneness in kabirs observation that a river and its waves are one'
p15168
aS'and guru nanak devjis prayer that lord may everyone in the world prosper and be in peace'
p15169
aS'let us be inspired by swami vivekanandas appeal against divisions and for people of all religions to hold the banner of harmony not of dispute'
p15170
aS'let us also reaffirm the enduring message of ahimsa of lord buddha and mahavira'
p15171
aS'and from this forum in this land of gandhi and of timeless prayers that always end with invocation of om shanti shanti shanti peace peace peace peace within and in the world'
p15172
aS'let us therefore send a message to the world - a melody of harmony and humanity- the embrace of diversity the spirit of oneness - of service with compassion and generosity - a resolve against terrorism a rejection of extremism- and a determination to advance peacelet us challenge the forces of violence with the kindness of our love and universal human values'

aS'some people also go outside their states'
p15234
aS'last time too i had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit'
p15235
aS'and i have noticed that the kind of work which our department of tourism our department of culture state governments and the government of india cant do that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of indian tourists'
p15236
aS'photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them'
p15237
aS'we have to take this task forward'
p15238
aS'do it this time as well'
p15239
aS'but this time along with a photo please write and send a small piece about the place thus displaying your creative prowess'
p15240
aS'one gets to learn a lot by visiting new places'
p15241
aS'things we cant learn in a classroom within our family from our friends sometimes we can learn those things by travelling'
p15242
aS'we get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit we learn about people their languages foods and lifestyles'
p15243
aS'someone has rightly said that a traveller without observation is a bird without wings'
p15244
aS'if you have a desire to truly view you should also develop an insight'
p15245
aS'india is full of diversities'
p15246
aS'once you set out to see the country for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it'
p15247
aS'i have been fortunate that i had a lot of opportunities to travel'
p15248
aS'when i was neither chief minister nor prime minster and i was young like you i travelled a lot'
p15249
aS'perhaps there isnt a district in india which i have not visited'
p15250
aS'travel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives'
p15251
aS'these days the youth of india are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity'
p15252
aS'unlike before they dont want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track'
p15253
aS'they want to do something new see something new'
p15254
aS'i see this as a good sign'
p15255
aS'our youth should be bold'
p15256
aS'they should be brave'
p15257
aS'they should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before'
p15258
aS'in this context i would like to specially congratulate coal india'
p15259
aS'western coalfields limited at savaner near nagpur where there are coal mines has developed an eco-friendly mine-tourism circuit'
p15260
aS'generally we dont think of coal mines as places to be visited'
p15261
aS'when we see pictures of miners we wonder what it must be like out there'
p15262
aS'we even have a saying coal blackens your hands hence people tend to stay away from coal mines'
p15263
aS'but western coalfields limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism'
p15264
aS'this is only the beginning but already nearly 10000 people have visited this eco-friendly mine-tourism site at savaner near nagpur'
p15265
aS'this in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new'
p15266
aS'i hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too'
p15267
aS'there is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free'
p15268
aS'both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it'
p15269
aS'maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way but it is being done'
p15270
aS'can you too being a tourist lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations'
p15271
aS'i am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task'
p15272
aS'tourism is a sector that provides maximum employment'
p15273
aS'even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism'
p15274
aS'when tourists visit a place even the not-so-well-off among them spend money'
p15275
aS'rich tourists are bound to spend more money'
p15276
aS'there are many employment opportunities created by tourism'
p15277
aS'india lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world'
p15278
aS'but if we 125 crore indians decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector we can attract the world'
p15279
aS'we can draw a very large number of tourists to our side'
p15280
aS'through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in india'
p15281
aS'be it the government institutions society citizens we all have to come together to make this happen'
p15282
aS'come lets make an endeavour in this direction'
p15283
aS'my dear young friends i dont like it when holidays are just frittered away'
p15284
aS'you too should think along these lines'
p15285
aS'will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that'
p15286
aS'i will give you something to ponder upon'
p15287
aS'can you resolve to add one skill one special attribute to your personality during your holidays'
p15288
aS'if you dont know how to swim can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays'
p15289
aS'if you dont know how to cycle can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays'
p15290
aS'or you could tell yourself i type with just two fingers on the keyboard so shouldnt i learn proper way of typing'
p15291
aS'there are so many skills to develop our personality'
p15292
aS'why not learn them'
p15293
aS'why not overcome some of our shortcomings'
p15294
aS'why not add to our strengths'
p15295
aS'do give it a thought'
p15296
aS'it is not like you need lots of classes a great trainer hefty fees or a big budget for this'
p15297
aS'you can find something around you'
p15298
aS'lets say you decide to make the best out of waste'
p15299
aS'just look for some waste material and start creating something from it'

p15301
aS'by the time evening falls you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish'
p15302
aS'suppose you are fond of painting and you dont know how to paint'
p15303
aS'just start painting and gradually you will get better at it'
p15304

p15305
aS'there can be countless areas where you could do so it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that i am spelling out for you'
p15306
aS'this will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously'
p15307
aS'just try it for yourself'
p15308
aS'when you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new they will realise that they wasted their time'
p15309
aS'they will admire you you are a very determined man my friend you have accomplished something concrete'
p15310
aS'this will perhaps become a big thing among friends'
p15311
aS'i am confident that you will surely do it and yes do share with me what you have learned'

p15326
aS'abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends'
p15327
aS'the great hindi poetess mahadevi verma used to love birds'
p15328

p15329
ag449
ag449
aS'come let us also do what mahadevi ji used to do'
p15330
aS'i greet abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing'
p15331
aS'shilpa kukke from mysore has raised a very humane issue'
p15332
aS'she says milkmen newspaper vendors postmen come close to our homes'
p15333
aS'sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes'
p15334
aS'have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days'
p15335
aS'have we ever given them water to drink'
p15336
aS'shilpa i am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner'
p15337
aS'it is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water he will feel good'
p15338
aS'of course it is a part of our nature in india'
p15339
aS'but i am glad shilpa that you have observed these things'
p15340
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters you must have repeatedly heard the term - digital india'
p15341
aS'some people feel that digital india is to do with the world of the youth in our cities'
p15342
aS'no its not like that'
p15343
aS'you will be happy to learn that a kisan suvidha app has been launched to serve your interests'
p15344
aS'if you download this kisan suvidha app on your mobile phone you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips'
p15345
aS'there are many topics on this app such as what is the state of the market what is the position of the wholesale market which crops are doing well these days which are the appropriate pesticides'
p15346
aS'not just this'
p15347
aS'there is a button on the app which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts'
p15348
aS'if you pose a question to them they will reply to it they will explain things to you'
p15349
aS'i hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the kisan suvidha app on their mobile phones'
p15350
aS'why dont you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you'
p15351
aS'if you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also'
p15352
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters summer is holiday time for the rest of the people but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more'
p15353
aS'a farmer waits for the rains'
p15354
aS'before that he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste'
p15355
aS'for farmers the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance'
p15356
aS'we will have to give a thought to what will happen if theres no water'
p15357
aS'can we utilise this time to visit ponds check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing because of which reservoirs get depleted'
p15358
aS'can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected'
p15359
aS'if we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds rivers and streams then even if the rains fail later our losses will be reduced'
p15360
aS'but this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water'
p15361
aS'you must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs'
p15362
aS'under mnrega also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation'
p15363
aS'every village should save water'
p15364
aS'how can we save every drop of water during the coming rains'
p15365
aS'how do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village'
p15366
aS'you should devise a plan and get connected with government schemes so that we can start a peoples movement which will help us understand the importance of water'
p15367
aS'then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation'
p15368
aS'there must be many such villages in the country many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work'
p15369
aS'but we still need to do much more in this direction'
p15370
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters a few days ago the government of india had organised a very big kisan mela farmers fair'
p15371
aS'there i saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture'
p15372
aS'but we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields'
p15373
aS'now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed'
p15374
aS'i welcome this'
p15375
aS'excessive use of fertilisers has made our mother earth unwell'
p15376
aS'we are the children of our soil so how can we watch our mother earth suffering'
p15377
aS'when we add spices and condiments while cooking our food it adds to the taste'
p15378
aS'but if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments then would one want to eat that food'
p15379
aS'the same food would taste so bad isnt it'
p15380
aS'the same thing happens with fertilisers as well'
p15381
aS'no matter how good fertilisers may be if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination'
p15382
aS'there should be a balance in everything'
p15383
aS'this will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money'
p15384
aS'our stand is clear less cost more output'
p15385
aS'invest less and reap more'
p15386
aS'we should move forward with this mantra and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods'
p15387
aS'i hope we will do with full concentration whatever is necessary for water conservation'
p15388
aS'we have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon'
p15389
aS'do remember the more we save water the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved'

aS'but now we are not scared of it because everybody knows tb is curable and can be easily cured'
p15418
aS'paradoxically when tb was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it but now that it is curable we have become almost careless about it'
p15419

p15509
aS'i look forward to welcoming him in india'
p15510
aS'thank you'
p15511
aS'minister for agriculture forests royal government of bhutan and chairman global tiger forum distinguished ministers from tiger range countries shri prakash javadekar our minister for environment forest climate change other dignitaries on the dais delegates from tiger range countries ladies and gentlemen'
p15512
aS'i am pleased to welcome you all'
p15513
aS'the tiger has brought all of us together here'
p15514
aS'this is an important meeting to discuss the conservation of one of the important endangered species'
p15515
aS'your very presence is a testimony to the importance your country attaches to this umbrella among species'
p15516
aS'as we all know the tiger is an apex consumer in the ecological pyramid and food chain'
p15517
aS'it requires a large amount of prey supported by good forests'
p15518
aS'therefore by protecting the tiger we protect the entire ecosystem and the ecological services which are equally crucial for the well-being of human beings'
p15519
aS'in fact the benefits from tiger conservation are enormous but intangible'
p15520
aS'we can not quantify this in economic terms'
p15521
aS'putting a price tag on nature is difficult'
p15522
aS'since mother nature has bestowed them for its own conservation it becomes our bounden duty to conserve them'
p15523
aS'in india the tiger is much more than just a wild animal'
p15524
aS'in our mythology the mother goddess who is the embodiment of mother nature is depicted sitting on a tiger'
p15525
aS'in fact most of our gods and goddesses are associated with some animal tree or river'
p15526
aS'in fact sometimes these animals are put on the same pedestal as gods and goddesses'
p15527
aS'no wonder the tiger is also our national animal'
p15528
aS'i am sure other tiger range countries would have some cultural legacy associated with tigers'
p15529
aS'friends'
p15530
aS'species belonging to the animal kingdom usually do not act to their disadvantage'
p15531
aS'however human beings are an exception'
p15532
aS'our compulsions and cravings our needs and greed have led to shrinkage of natural habitat and destruction of ecosystems'
p15533
aS'here i recall the famous words of gautam buddha who said the forest is a peculiar organism of unlimited kindness'
p15534
aS'it affords protection to all beings offering shade even to the axe-man who destroys it'
p15535
aS'i appreciate the good efforts made by the tiger range countries in conserving tigers'
p15536
aS'i compliment you all for this great ongoing effort'
p15537
aS'i also appreciate the efforts through global tiger initiative and the council'
p15538
aS'i must mention the great effort made by mr vladimir putin in convening the tiger summit in 2010'
p15539
aS'the global tiger recovery programme was an important outcome of these efforts'
p15540
aS'i also appreciate the initiatives of mr dorji the chairman of the global tiger forum'
p15541
aS'however from what i have been told it appears that tiger habitats have reduced drastically across tiger range countries'
p15542
aS'the situation has been aggravated further by the ongoing trafficking in body parts and derivatives of this magnificent animal'
p15543
aS'in india too we have been facing the challenge of poaching and disruption in their ecosystems'
p15544
aS'the positive side for us in india is that majority of the population respects trees animals forests rivers and other elements of nature like the sun and the moon'
p15545
aS'we consider the earth as our mother'
p15546
aS'our scriptures encourage us to treat the entire universe as one'
p15547
aS'and is our philosophy'
p15548
aS'we pray for peace and prosperity of everyone - including the ecosystem friends'
p15549
aS'forests are inseparable from wild animals'
p15550
aS'both are mutually complementary'
p15551
aS'destruction of one leads to destruction of the other'
p15552
aS'this is an important cause of climate change which is now affecting us adversely in many ways'
p15553
aS'this is a global phenomenon which all of us are grappling with'
p15554
aS'as a solution we have committed to work towards country specific mitigation strategies'
p15555
aS'in my view for the tiger range countries a viable tiger population undoubtedly symbolises a mitigation strategy for climate change'
p15556
aS'this will create a huge carbon sink in the form of tiger bearing forests'
p15557
aS'thus conservation of tiger will go a long way in ensuring a good future for ourselves and our coming generations'
p15558
aS'india has a long standing and successful track record of protecting its tigers'
p15559
aS'we launched project tiger in 1973'
p15560
aS'its coverage has increased considerably from the initial 9 tiger reserves to 49 at present'
p15561
aS'tiger conservation is a collective responsibility of the government of india and states'
p15562
aS'i also compliment our state governments for their efforts'
p15563
aS'but the efforts of government can not succeed unless they are supported by the people'
p15564
aS'our cultural legacy which encourages compassion and co-existence has played an important role in the success of project tiger'
p15565
aS'due to such collective efforts there has been a rise of thirty per cent in the number of tigers'
p15566
aS'it has gone up from 1706 in 2010 to 2226 in 2014'
p15567
aS'our national tiger conservation authority has taken many landmark initiatives'
p15568
aS'use of modern technology including intelligent infrared and thermal cameras on a 24x7 basis is being promoted for surveillance against poaching in sensitive tiger reserves'
p15569
aS'several protocols for smart patrolling and tiger monitoring have been evolved'
p15570
aS'radio telemetry is also being promoted to monitor tigers'
p15571
aS'a national repository of tiger camera trap photo database is also being created'
p15572
aS'to do all this we have this year doubled our allocation for tiger conservation'
p15573
aS'we have increased it from rupees 185 crores to rupees 380 crores which is 3'
p15574
aS'8 billion rupees'
p15575
aS'i strongly believe that tiger conservation or conservation of nature is not a drag on development'
p15576
aS'both can happen in a mutually complementary manner'
p15577
aS'all we need is to re-orient our strategy by factoring in the concerns of the tiger in sectors where tiger conservation is not the goal'
p15578
aS'this is a difficult task but can be achieved'
p15579
aS'our genius lies in smartly integrating the tiger and wildlife safeguards in various infrastructures at the landscape level'
p15580
aS'this essentially takes us to the much needed smart green infrastructure while adopting a landscape approach'
p15581
aS'the landscape approach would also help us to involve business groups through corporate social responsibility for various initiatives towards tiger conservation'
p15582
aS'in the indian context we intend to achieve this through the tiger conservation plans'
p15583
aS'considering the ecosystem value of tiger conservation areas we need to consider them as natural capital'
p15584
aS'our institutions have done an economic valuation of a few tiger reserves'
p15585
aS'this study has highlighted the fact that besides conserving the tiger these reserves also provide a range of economic social cultural and spiritual benefits'
p15586
aS'these are known as ecosystem services'
p15587
aS'thus we need to define conservation as a means to achieve development rather than considering it to be anti-growth'
p15588
aS'this calls for factoring in the value of the ecosystem in the economic arithmetic of development and growth'
p15589
aS'friends'
p15590
aS'i am confident that we can achieve a framework to foster proactive engagement of industry for conservation'
p15591
aS'the natural capital denoting the stock of natural ecosystems should be treated at par with capital goods'
p15592
aS'our economy needs to be viewed as a subset of a larger economy of natural resources and ecosystem services which sustain us'
p15593
aS'as a country having more than seventy per cent of the global tiger population india is committed to complement the initiatives of other tiger range countries'
p15594
aS'we have bilateral arrangements with china nepal bhutan bangladesh'
p15595
aS'we hope to continue our efforts to address issues of mutual concern for the tiger'
p15596
aS'a major threat to the tiger is the demand for its body parts and derivatives'
p15597
aS'the forest and its wild denizens are an open treasury which can not be locked up'
p15598
aS'it is painful to learn about trafficking of body parts and derivatives of tigers and other big cats'
p15599
aS'we need to collaborate at the highest levels of government to address this serious issue'
p15600
aS'india along with several tiger range countries is a founder member of the global tiger forum which is headquartered in new delhi'
p15601
aS'this is the only inter-governmental organisation of its kind'
p15602
aS'it is now working closely with the global tiger initiative council'
p15603
aS'as a host country i assure you of our fullest support'
p15604
aS'we will also be happy to support capacity building of wildlife personnel at the wildlife institute of india'
p15605
aS'the tiger range countries are signatories to other international conventions to address international trade on endangered species'
p15606
aS'in this regard i want to give you another good news'
p15607
aS'we are moving towards formally adopting the statute of south asia wildlife enforcement network'
p15608
aS'at the end i would like to emphasise that conservation of tigers is not a choice'
p15609
aS'it is an imperative'
p15610
aS'i would also like to emphasise that regional co-operation is essential for combating wildlife crime'
p15611
aS'in this conference let us resolve to work together to protect the tiger and its space'
p15612
aS'india is committed to engage with all tiger range countries for this purpose'
p15613
aS'i appreciate your presence and wish this conference all success'
p15614
aS'thank you'
p15615

p15618
aS'i have great pleasure in being with you and welcoming you at the maritime india summit'
p15619
aS'this is the first time that a global event of such a large scale is being organised by india'
p15620
aS'i extend a warm welcome to all the esteemed guests attending this event in the maritime hub of india'
p15621
aS'i am sure this event together with the seminars and exhibition will showcase the emerging trends and opportunities in the maritime sector'
p15622
aS'we all know that oceans cover more than seventy percent of the earths surface'
p15623
aS'we also know that oceans contain ninety-seven percent of the earths water'
p15624
aS'therefore maritime transport can be the most extensive mode of transport'
p15625
aS'it is also the most eco-friendly mode of transport'
p15626
aS'however there is one more aspect to this fact'
p15627
aS'which is that oceans contain ninety nine percent of the living space on the planet'
p15628
aS'this means that our lifestyle transport systems and trading behavior should not spoil the ecology of the oceans'
p15629
aS'also maritime security freedom of navigation and safety and security of sea lanes is equally important'
p15630
aS'the challenges of climate change have shown that even offshore human behavior can change the ecology of glaciers and oceans'
p15631
aS'this is already causing a lot of concern for island countries and coastal communities in particular'
p15632
aS'i hope this summit will deliberate on these issues while discussing economic issues related with oceans'
p15633
aS'the elimination of sea piracy which was a big threat to international shipping a few years ago is a good example of how joint efforts by maritime nations can achieve outstanding results'
p15634
aS'friends'
p15635
aS'there is a reason why this important summit has been organised today on the 14th of april 2016'
p15636

aS'babasaheb ambedkar on this auspicious day'
p15642
aS'i also wish and pray that his wisdom continues to guide us in our efforts towards nation building'
p15643
aS'many of us may not know that babasaheb created two powerful institutions related to water navigation and power'
p15644
aS'they were the central waterways irrigation and navigation commission and the central technical power board'
p15645
aS'his observations while setting up these two organizations is a testimony to his great foresight'
p15646
aS'i quote from his address on 3rd january 1945 the objects which have led to the setting up of two organizations are to advise on how the water resources can be best utilized and how a project can be made to serve purposes other than irrigation'
p15647
aS'dr ambedkar had emphasized the importance of the new waterways policy in order to lay the foundation for a regime of prosperity for the millions of poor of our country'
p15648
aS'i am happy to state that we have embarked on the development of national waterways in keeping with babasahebs vision and foresight'
p15649
aS'with a gdp growth rate of more than seven percent india is the fastest growing major economy today'
p15650
aS'the imf and the world bank have indicated even better prospects in the days to come'
p15651

p15659
aS'this dock was equipped to berth and service ships'
p15660
aS'it was built after studying tidal flows'
p15661
aS'in addition to lothal there were also some other indian ports which were major drivers of global maritime trade two thousand years ago'
p15662
aS'these included barygaza - which today is known as bharuch in gujarat muziris which today is known as kodungallur near cochin in kerala korkai which is todays tuticorin kaveripattinam which is in nagapattanam district of tamil nadu andarikamedu which is in ariyankuppam district of puducherry there are many references in ancient indian literature and in greek and roman works about the vibrant maritime trade of india with rome greece egypt and arabia'

p15664
aS'friends'
p15665
aS'since my government took over among other things we have laid emphasis on building futuristic infrastructure'
p15666
aS'this includes building next generation infrastructure in many sectors'
p15667
aS'port shipping and maritime infrastructure is prominent among them'
p15668
aS'it is my governments endeavour to revive and restore indias position of eminence in the global maritime sector'
p15669
aS'building upon our glorious maritime tradition we are working hard to achieve new heights in this area'
p15670
aS'in the very early days of our government we announced the sagarmala programme'
p15671
aS'this is aimed at leveraging our long coastline and natural maritime advantages'
p15672
aS'it also focuses on promoting port led development energizing the coastal economy and infrastructure development in these areas'
p15673
aS'we particularly want to modernize our ports and integrate them with special economic zones port based smart cities industrial parks warehouses logistics parks and transport corridors'
p15674
aS'i must mention that our vast coastline of 7500 kilometers offers a huge investment opportunity'
p15675
aS'apart from the length of the coastline indias maritime potential also lies in its strategic location on all major shipping highways'
p15676
aS'in addition we have an expansive and productive hinterland through which flows a network of mighty rivers'
p15677
aS'our maritime agenda will complement this ambitious infrastructure plan for the hinterland which is going on in parallel'
p15678
aS'i call upon the global business community to partner with us to give shape to our process of port led development'
p15679
aS'i am sure the long coastline of india along with diverse coastal regions and hard working coastal communities can become an engine of growth of india'

p15714
aS'approximately eighteen percent of indias population lives in 72 coastal districts'
p15715
aS'it comprises twelve percent of indias landmass'
p15716
aS'therefore there is a need for holistic and sustainable development of coastal regions and communities'

aS'in addition we are also focusing on value addition in fisheries aquaculture and cold chain development'
p15725
aS'the port sector in india is a good mix of private and public ports with both contributing to the growth of the sector'

aS'the ppp model of development has been quite successful in this sector and has helped in bringing latest technology and best practices'
p15727
aS'private ports have been growing at a very healthy pace and have nearly doubled their capacity in the last 5 years'

p15801
aS'they touch the lives of not just those who read them but they resonate with the future generations as well'
p15802
aS'such is the power of the writings of dinkar ji'
p15803
aS'jai prakash narayan ji who revolutionized india was much older as compared to the young generation and dinkar jis poems were like as a bridge between the two'
p15804
aS'everyone is aware that that in the fight against corruption the poems of dinkarji which prasoon ji just sang would inspire the youth and awaken the country'
p15805
aS'he would not let the society be a mute spectator'
p15806
aS'not only this he wont sleep in peace as long as the society slept'
p15807
aS'he wanted to keep the society alert by awakening its conscience and by revolutionizing its spirit'
p15808
aS'he did not find freedom in mere self expression'
p15809
aS'he wanted that the flame inside him should spread everywhere but he did not visualize it as a destructive force capable of burning everything but as an inspirational light that would guide the future generations'
p15810
aS'this is a rarity'
p15811
aS'i am a worshipper of goddess saraswati and hence i am able to experience the power of the spoken word'
p15812
aS'i know how some words can be so powerful so as to change the course of lives and i can very well feel that strength within me'
p15813
aS'as a worshipper and a priest i know that dinkar ji has given us an invaluable gift and we will have to see how we take it forward to future generations'
p15814
aS'i sometimes feel that in our country there might be thousands of poets and lovers of literature in every generation'
p15815
aS'i believe that there might be literature lover in thousands who might be reciting dinkar jis creations by heart'
p15816
aS'this by no means is a small achievement'
p15817
aS'some people recite the shlokas from ramayana mahabharata vedas and upanishads'
p15818
aS'similarly there might be others who would be orally reciting dinkar jis words'
p15819
aS'they might be finding pleasure in the same in lending voice to dinkar jis creations'
p15820
aS'they might be thinking that people may or may not hear me but the world will definitely hear dinkar ji'
p15821
aS'dinkar ji created parshuram ki pratiksha'
p15822
aS'his creations had inputs from history as well as cultural sensitivities the greatness demonstrated by india at various points and the capacity to imbibe everything'
p15823
aS'the way dinkar ji experienced it is reflected time and again through his creations'
p15824
aS'and this way we can open insightful windows through his literature into an understanding of india'
p15825
aS'if we have the potential we can open doors too'
p15826
aS'but if there is no potential we can at least open the windows'
p15827
aS'dinkar ji has laid the foundation of such a potential amongst us'
p15828
aS'dinkar ji told us a few things but perhaps we like to forget them and people forget them'
p15829
aS'time and again some vices creep into the society'
p15830
aS'they are different every time'
p15831
aS'someone tried once to be close to dinkar ji citing that he belonged to the same caste'
p15832
aS'he wanted dinkar ji to support him'
p15833
aS'this happens many a times in the society'
p15834
aS'but in such situations too how apt was his thinking we get a glimpse of it otherwise most people fall prey to such things'
p15835
aS'dinkar ji was member of the rajya sabha and had a chance to both view and experience politics closely yet he kept himself aloof from such an environment'
p15836
aS'he wrote a letter to the gentleman in 1961 that the only way out to improve the situation in bihar is that people should forget their caste and come together to respect the merit'
p15837
aS'remember the state does not run on the support of one or two castes'
p15838
aS'it requires the support of many and if we fail to rise above casteism then the social fabric of bihar will rot'
p15839
aS'the letter written in 1961 till date gives such an inspirational message for bihar'
p15840
aS'these are not the words of a person in politics nor are they the words of a poet or literary person'
p15841
aS'they are the words of a saint like man who could pre empt the future and who was worried about bihars future'
p15842
aS'and that is why his words had the power to clearly indicate his intentions to the people of his society'
p15843
aS'if bihar has to move forward if bihar has to move ahead then realize one thing unless the eastern end of india develops india can not surge ahead'
p15844
aS'the western end however rich it is can not make a difference until the eastern end of india joins the road to development'
p15845
aS'our motherland can not realize its true potential till then'
p15846
aS'it is our dream that the eastern end becomes equal to the western end and there is no reason why it can not do so'
p15847
aS'if bihar bengal assam north eastern states all rise and move forward then the world will watch in amazement the progress made by india'
p15848
aS'dinkar ji also had dreamt of the development of bihar'
p15849
aS'bihar should be glorious progressive and prosperous'
p15850
aS'bihar may earn its own glory and pride and not borrow it from someone else'
p15851
aS'it has the potential it just needs opportunities to become prosperous'
p15852
aS'bihar has the strength which given a chance it can leave everyone behind in the race'
p15853
aS'we are committed to fulfill dinkar jis dream'
p15854
aS'the journey of 50 years of his creations still inspires us to do something not merely recite his verses'
p15855
aS'it inspires us to achieve something so today in this auditorium remembering his literary creations we should see this as an opportunity to recommit ourselves'
p15856
aS'may his blessings remain with us so that we may fulfill our commitments and move forward to the realization of the dreams of bihar'

p16218
aS'well friends i am glad to know this through your letters'

aS'please try and strive to move forward with hope and trust in your lives'
p16272
aS'meanwhile many incidents have happened since my previous mann ki baat'
p16273
aS'our government has completed one year'
p16274
aS'the entire nation analysed us quite minutely and criticised us'
p16275
aS'many people gave us a distinction for our governance'
p16276
aS'in democracy i believe that it is very important to receive the feedback from the supporters and the opposition in politics'
p16277
aS'we must try to understand the drawbacks and the areas where we lag behind'
p16278
aS'it is also beneficial to understand our merits'
p16279
aS'in my case i am happy with all that has happened so far'
p16280
aS'my heart is always yearning to do something for the poor people in our country'
p16281
aS'i always think of novel ideas and accept suggestions from others in order to help the poor'
p16282
aS'last month we launched 3 key policies to provide social security to the people of our society i'
p16283
ag1875
aS'prime ministers suraksha bima yojna prime ministers jeevan jyoti bima yojna and atal pension yojna'
p16284
aS'it has been just twenty days since the launch of these policies and i can proudly say that due to your trust in our nation our government and our programmes and policies the common citizens of our country have joined hands with us in such huge numbers'
p16285
aS'i am extremely happy in sharing the fact that within a short span of 20 days more than 8 crore and 52 lakhs people have registered their names for these programmes'
p16286
aS'we have adopted important measures in the path of social security and it will act as a boon for the people in the future years'
p16287
aS'for those who have not yet received this information i would like to request them to acquire these benefits as soon as possible'
p16288
aS'no one could have imagined receiving suraksha bima yojna by investing just one rupee per month or 12 rupees in a year'
p16289
aS'in order to get the benefits of jeevan jyoti bima yojna you need to invest just 330 rupees in a year which is less than a rupee per day'
p16290
aS'therefore by using these benefits the poor will not be dependent on others for their living'
p16291
aS'the poor will become independent and self-confident'
p16292
aS'we are adopting different measures in this direction'
p16293
aS'i want to create an army of people my army comprising of poor people will fight against poverty and defeat it'
p16294
aS'our nation has been burdened with poverty for years now and we will take appropriate steps to try and eliminate poverty from our nation'
p16295
aS'we are sure we will succeed'
p16296
aS'another most important development is the introduction of a channel for farmers on television and i am feeling happy about it'
p16297
aS'we have a number of channels on televisions in our country such as cartoon channels sports channels news channels and entertainment channels'
p16298
aS'for me the channel for farmers is very important as i can clearly see the future of farmers through this channel'
p16299
aS'according to my view this channel is like an open university for farmers and their farms'
p16300
aS'this is a channel where both students and teachers are farmers'
p16301
aS'these farmers can learn a lot of things through excellent experience and move from traditional farming towards modern farming'
p16302
aS'only minimal areas are left for farming'
p16303
aS'the families of farmers are increasing in number but the land area is reducing'
p16304
aS'due to this problem it is very critical to understand the ways to grow crops efficiently in such small areas'
p16305
aS'now we can get details about the weather forecast and plan accordingly'
p16306
aS'the channels for farmers will be focussing on these various issues'
p16307
aS'my farmer brothers and sisters a system for monitoring farmers has been arranged in each of our districts'
p16308
aS'please contact the respective district heads for availing this benefit'
p16309
aS'i would like to speak to my fisherman brothers and sisters to all those who are involved with fishery'
p16310
aS'there are many things for them to learn from this channel'
p16311
aS'in india animal husbandry has been a traditional segment in a villagers life which acts as a supportive role in farming'
p16312
aS'however as compared to the number of animals and the amount of milk production in various countries around the world india lacks far behind'
p16313
aS'as compared to the numbers of animals the estimated amount of milk production is not achieved in our country'
p16314
aS'the process by which we can produce more milk per animal the ways in which the animals can be taken care of and the types of food that should be provided to them are some the important factors to be considered'
p16315
aS'we take various measures based on our traditions but we need to move forward by adopting scientific methods and technologies'
p16316
aS'by adopting these scientific methods farmers as well as the animal husbandry can help us achieve financial strength'
p16317
aS'in this way we can provide confidence and power to the farmers and also the animal keepers'
p16318
aS'we should get scientific guidance regarding the direction in which we should move forward and attain success in this area'
p16319
aS'my dear countrymen'
p16320
aS'do you remember this date 21st june'
p16321
aS'generally 21st june is remembered as the longest day of the year'
p16322
aS'but recently this date has gained a new significance in the world'
p16323
aS'in september last year i had raised a subject and proposed to celebrate 21st june as international yoga day while addressing the united nations assembly'
p16324
aS'the whole world was astonished and you will also be surprised to know that within hundred days we got support from 177 countries and this proposal was successfully passed'
p16325
aS'in the history of united nations such huge numbers of supporters from different countries were seen for the first time'
p16326
aS'this proposal was passed in a very short span of time with the support of various countries around the world'
p16327
aS'this is a proud moment for every indian'
p16328
aS'now this is our responsibility'
p16329
aS'would we have ever thought that yoga can act as a connecting link between nations'
p16330
aS'vasudhaiv kutumbakam implies that our ancestors had imagined the same where yoga will act as a catalyst in connecting the world'
p16331
aS'this is news of utmost happiness and pride for us'
p16332
aS'but to achieve its real significance we need to project the real essence of yoga and its real strength to the entire world'
p16333
aS'yoga connects the heart and mind and acts as a medium for freedom from ailments and lust'
p16334
aS'i am realizing that yoga connects the body mind and knowledge'
p16335
aS'now it is has been widely proven that yoga can also act as a medium for connecting the world'
p16336
aS'why are we not taking steps to become an ambassador for this venture'
p16337
aS'why not move forward in this path of human development with the help of this vital knowledge of yoga'
p16338
aS'we must celebrate 21st june as yoga day in every corner of india'
p16339
aS'please call up your relatives and friends staying in different parts of the world and ask them to gather in groups and celebrate yoga day'
p16340
aS'if they have no knowledge of yoga ask them to take help from books'
p16341
aS'read and explain the importance of yoga in our lives'
p16342
aS'you can also read various letters on yoga'
p16343
aS'i strongly believe that by declaring yoga day we have taken an important step in the development of the world'
p16344
aS'we have contributed to human development by removing stress from the lives of people by providing positive energy to those who have lost all hopes in their lives'
p16345
aS'i want that what world has accepted what world has respected and what world has given to india should be a matter of pride three weeks are left and you should take efforts and join and make others join'
p16346
aS'i would especially like to speak to my soldiers of the army who are fighting for our countrys safety'
p16347
aS'they have joined the army for their living and have sacrificed their lives for our country'
p16348
aS'here i am not speaking to them as a prime minister but from my inner self inner truth and deep emotions that i have for my soldiers'
p16349
aS'questions about one-rank and one-pension have not been resolved or answered for over forty years'
p16350
aS'there is no denial from the truth that the previous governments have spoken about this issue but have never done something about it'
p16351
aS'i can assure you and i have also promised my army men that my government will surely launch one-rank and one-pension'
p16352
aS'we know our responsibilities and after the formation of our government different departments have begun working on this issue'
p16353
aS'i used to consider this to be a simple issue but it is far more complicated than i thought and for forty years this issue has been delayed'
p16354
aS'in order to resolve this issue in a simpler direction i have asked the government officials to find solutions to this problem'
p16355
aS'it is not necessary to provide information to media every single second'
p16356
aS'there is no requirement to run a commentary for this issue'
p16357
aS'i would like to assure you and i would like to repeat that our government will launch one-rank and one-pension and provide solutions to all related issues'
p16358
aS'your life is very important to us owing to the thought-process and ideals with which we are moving forward'
p16359
aS'i would like to connect with you and help you not just as a part of any government programme or any political campaign but as a reflection of my patriotism'
p16360
aS'i once again would like to convey to all the soldiers of my country that we are not one of those people who in the name of politics played games with you for the past forty years'
p16361
aS'i am against this path and i am not willing to take any step which would complicate the existing issues'
p16362
aS'i want you to trust me even if people are talking against us and playing games in the name of politics'
p16363
aS'i would like to provide all the assistance to my people who are sacrificing their lives for the country'
p16364
aS'these are my motives and i believe that the words from my soul which is made up of nothing but truth will touch your heart as well'
p16365
aS'you have kept your patience intact for forty years'
p16366
aS'i need some time and opportunity to work'
p16367
aS'once again i would like to assure my countrymen that we will mutually work on this issue and find solutions for the same'
p16368
aS'you all must have visited different parts of the country during vacations'
p16369
aS'some of you must be planning now to visit places'
p16370
aS'it is natural that seeing is believing'
p16371
aS'when we visit places we may go to our relatives place or go sight-seeing'
p16372
aS'we get to explore and understand the world'
p16373
aS'for a person who has just seen a pond in his village the experience of seeing an ocean can not be expressed in words'
p16374
aS'he is unable to describe the size of ocean in front of the villagers as seeing is altogether a different experience'
p16375
aS'when in vacations while you are travelling with friends or family or planning to go i do not know if you have the habit of writing a diary while travelling'
p16376
aS'i believe you must jot down your experiences when you meet new people and you should write down in words all that influenced you'
p16377
aS'when you see something you should describe it in words'
p16378
aS'in other words you must assimilate what you see or feel within you'
p16379
aS'travelling is a form of knowledge in itself'
p16380
aS'it is not possible for all of us to get a chance to climb the himalayas'
p16381
aS'one must read the adventurous travel stories through the books written by those who have got a chance to visit the himalayas'
p16382
aS'i am not saying that you should become a writer'
p16383
aS'we should travel and write to learn something new to understand our country and to know its varied diversity'
p16384
aS'we can write about a particular place the food-habits of the people there their clothing style language and culture and also about their dreams aspirations and problems'
p16385
aS'we are living in this vast nation'
p16386
aS'if we want to understand the entire nation one life is not enough to do this'
p16387
aS'it is my earnest request to all of you who are planning to visit or travel to share your travelling experiences with me'
p16388
aS'i would be glad to read your stories'
p16389
aS'i would request you to mail me your photo and your experience with incredible india and i will share your impressive stories with others'
p16390
aS'i would like to feel what you have experienced'
p16391
aS'i would to like see from far what you have seen during your travel'
p16392
aS'you can visit a sea shore and take a walk alone'
p16393
aS'though i may be unable to do this by reading your story i would love to share your vivid experience with others'
p16394
aS'on this note let me remind you once again please take care of yourself and do not fall sick'
p16395
aS'there are many ways to protect yourself from the summer heat but please take care of the birds and animals around you too'
p16396
aS'i have spoken all that came out of my heart'
p16397
aS'i will meet you all again and will speak again'
p16398
aS'my heartfelt greetings to one and all'
p16399
aS'thank you all for your support'
p16400
aS'i am delighted to return to afghanistan honoured to be among people who have set the standard of courage for our age privileged to see again the high tide of friendship in this vast ocean of love for india'
p16401
aS'this is yet another giant step in afghanistans march to progress'
p16402
aS'and it is a historic moment of emotion and pride in the relations between afghanistan and india'
p16403
aS'thank you mr president for your invitation and for naming this dam as afghanistan-india friendship dam'
p16404
aS'we are truly humbled by the generosity of the afghan spirit'
p16405
aS'rivers have been bearers of great civilisations of the world'
p16406
aS'in the flow of rivers runs the course of human progress'
p16407
aS'in the holy quran river is central to the image of paradise'
p16408
aS'in the ancient scriptures of india rivers defined our nation and were celebrated as the giver of life'
p16409
aS'and it is a wise afghan proverb that says kabul be zar basha be barf ne may kabul be without gold rather than snow'
p16410
aS'for the snow feeds the rivers that sustain life and agriculture'
p16411
aS'so today we are not just launching a project that will irrigate land and light up homes'
p16412
aS'we are reviving a region restoring hope renewing life and redefining afghanistans future'
p16413
aS'the dam is a generator not just of electricity but also of optimism and belief in the future of afghanistan'
p16414
aS'the project would not just irrigate the fields of six hundred and forty villages in chiste obe pashtun zarghun karokh gozara injil zindjan kohsan and ghoryan'
p16415
aS'it would also bring light to over two hundred and fifty thousand homes in this area'
p16416
aS'last december in kabul i was moved by the honour of inaugurating the afghan parliament building'
p16417
aS'it was a tribute to the epic struggle of the afghan people to shape their future by vote and debate not gun and violence'
p16418
aS'on this summer day in herat we come together to honour and celebrate afghan determination to build a future of prosperity'
p16419
aS'afghans and indians dreamt of this project in the nineteen seventies'
p16420
aS'the lost decades speak to us about the ravages of a long drawn war'
p16421
aS'it was a war not of afghan making but it was one that stole the future of an entire generation of afghans'
p16422
aS'and when a new dawn broke over afghanistan in 2001 we resumed the project'
p16423
aS'with resolve and patience courage and belief we have together overcome distance and hurdles threats and violence'
p16424
aS'today the brave afghan people are sending a message that the forces of destruction and death denial and domination shall not prevail'
p16425
aS'they will not come in the way of the dreams and aspirations of the afghan people'
p16426
aS'the fields that produce the finest fruits and saffron shall once again come alive with the clear waters of the river'
p16427
aS'the homes that lived through dark nights of dread will now be lit by the power of hope'
p16428
aS'men and women shall once again work the farms and ply their trade with the joy of hard work in peace and security'
p16429
aS'the shoulders that were once weighed down in the shadow of guns would now bear ploughs to turn the land green'
p16430
aS'children shall again believe in the possibility of a future of education and opportunity'
p16431
aS'and another young girl poet will not have to live a life of pain denial and longing or see a life of promise cut short'
p16432
aS'herat has time and again seen sublime glory and tragic ruin'
p16433
aS'and the city that once jalaluddin rumi held as the finest will rise again'
p16434
aS'the city that was the gateway to the west south and central asia will once again be the hub that will unite the regions in a peaceful pursuit of prosperity'
p16435
aS'so to the people and government of herat and the government of afghanistan i express our deepest appreciation for your support patience and understanding and above all your belief in us'
p16436
aS'this dam has not been built by bricks and mortar but by the faith of our friendship and the valour of afghans and indians'
p16437
aS'and at this moment of pride we also stand in grief and gratitude for lives sacrificed so that afghan people will have a future they so richly deserve and so deeply desire'
p16438
aS'the blood sweat and tears of our people are mixed into this earth and have formed between us an eternal bond written into the soil of this land'
p16439
aS'bonds that remind us of ancient links between this region and india'
p16440
aS'for many the harirud river is one strand of our connected histories since the ancient vedic times'
p16441
aS'today the world will see the harirud river as an abiding emblem of our commitment to a shared future of progress'
p16442
aS'and the friendship dam unites us in solidarity as chishti sharif joined us in spirit centuries ago'
p16443
aS'for it is from here that the chishti silsila or chishti tradition of sufism came to india'
p16444
aS'its glorious tradition and teachings resonate through the dargahs of ajmer delhi and fatehpur sikri'
p16445
aS'it draws people from all faiths with its message of love peace compassion of harmony among people of all beliefs of respect for all of gods creations and service to humanity'
p16446
aS'indians and afghans know that these values not extremism and violence define afghanistan - a nation brimming with poetry of love and spiritual tradition of peace and harmony'
p16447
aS'and these are the values that give the great afghan people the patience and persistence to seek peace with their own who have chosen the path of violence and also with those who support them'
p16448
aS'afghans have pursued this path despite the strength of their belief that they can defend their freedom like no other people on this earth'
p16449
aS'and it is on the foundation of these values that afghans and indians seek each other not because they harbour designs against another'
p16450
aS'khwaja moiunuddin chishti the first of the chishti saints in india said that human beings must have the affection of the sun the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth'
p16451
aS'he not only had the magnificent landscape of his ancestral land in mind he could also be describing the afghan people'
p16452
aS'so when i came to kabul in december in the warmth of your welcome i saw the kindness of your heart'
p16453
aS'in your clear eyes i saw the deep well of affection for india'
p16454
aS'in your smiles i saw the joy of this relationship'
p16455
aS'in the firmness of your embrace i felt the trust in our friendship'
p16456
aS'and in those memorable hours india witnessed once again the grace of your people the beauty of this land and the friendship of a nation'
p16457
aS'today i return with the gratitude and admiration of 1'
p16458
aS'25 billion people'
p16459
aS'and a renewed pledge for our partnership'
p16460
aS'together our partnership has built schools health centres and irrigation facilities for rural communities'
p16461
aS'it has empowered women with skills and the youth with the education to shoulder the responsibility for afghanistans future'
p16462
aS'we have joined hands to build roads that bridge the distances of your country from zaranj to delaram and transmission lines that bring power to your homes'
p16463
aS'now indias investment in the port at chahbahar in iran will give afghanistan a new route to the world and a new path to prosperity'
p16464
aS'and to implement that vision just last month president ghani joined president rouhani of iran and me in witnessing the signing of the chahbahar trade and transit agreement between afghanistan iran and india'
p16465
aS'the fruits of our friendship are not confined to kabul kandahar mazar and herat'
p16466
aS'they will never be'
p16467
aS'our cooperation will extend to every part of afghanistan'
p16468
aS'our partnership will benefit every section of afghan society'
p16469
aS'because across its difficult geography and across its diversity and beyond the identities as pushtuns tajiks uzbeks and hazaras afghanistan must live and prosper as one'
p16470
aS'for divisions among afghan people will only help those who seek to dominate the nation from outside'
p16471
aS'as we work together we draw strength and confidence from your deep commitment to protect our partnership from the designs of others'
p16472
aS'when our people are under attack the brave afghans guard us as their own'
p16473
aS'they put themselves in the line of fire so that their indian friends are safe'
p16474
aS'this is the nobility of your heart and the strength of your friendship'
p16475
aS'i have seen this from the moment i assumed office as prime minister'
p16476
aS'for on that day when terrorists launched a massive attack on our consulate in this city of herat the heroic efforts of afghan soldiers and of our personnel saved many lives and prevented a big tragedy'
p16477
aS'mr'
p16478
aS'president friends afghanistans success is a deeply held hope and desire of every indian'
p16479
aS'it comes from the love and admiration for afghans in our hearts'
p16480
aS'we want to see your democracy strike deep roots your people unite and your economy prosper'
p16481
aS'we want to see your art culture and poetry thrive'
p16482
aS'and we want to see your cricketers join the ranks of test players and also seek glory in ipl'
p16483
aS'but it also comes from the recognition that when afghanistan succeeds the world will be safer and more beautiful'
p16484
aS'when the values that define afghans prevail terrorism and extremism will be in retreat'
p16485
aS'because we know that extremism and terrorism can not stop at your border or end at the boundaries of our region'
p16486
aS'so in the spreading unrest of our times the world can not forget the brave struggle that the afghan people are waging - for themselves and our world'
p16487
aS'india will not forget or turn away'
p16488
aS'as i said then and i will say it again your friendship is our honour your dreams are our duty'
p16489
aS'indias capacity may be limited but our commitment is without limits'
p16490
aS'our resources may be modest but our will is boundless'
p16491
aS'for others their commitments may have a sunset clause but our relationship is timeless'
p16492
aS'we face barriers of geography and politics but we define our path from the clarity of our purpose'
p16493
aS'we see resistance and suspicion of others but our resolve is strong and your faith and trust guides us forward'
p16494
aS'where some doubt your future we are certain that no force or power can deny the afghan people the destiny they have chosen however long and hard the journey may be'
p16495
aS'so on international platforms and in regional forums we will speak in one voice for the afghan right to a peaceful prosperous united inclusive and democratic nation'
p16496
aS'and in the fields villages and cities of afghanistan we will work together for that future'
p16497
aS'and whatever happens in a bright or a dark moment we will always experience as herats great sufi poet hakim jami would say the freshness and happiness of the gentle breeze of friendship'
p16498
aS'thank you for this honour this affection and this friendship'

p16510
aS'in granting me this opportunity you have honoured the worlds largest democracy and its 1'

aS'speaker two days ago i began my visit by going to the arlington national cemetery -the final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land'
p16515
aS'i honoured their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy'
p16516
aS'it was also the seventy-second anniversary of the d-day'
p16517
aS'on that day thousands from this great country fought to protect the torch of liberty on the remote shores of a land that they did not know'
p16518
aS'they sacrificed their lives so that the world lives in freedom'
p16519
aS'i applaud india applauds the great sacrifices of the men and women from the land of the free and the home of the brave in service of mankind'
p16520
aS'india knows what this means because our soldiers too have fallen in distant battlefields for the same ideals'
p16521
aS'that is why the threads of freedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies'
p16522
aS'mr'
p16523
aS'speaker our nations may have been shaped by differing histories cultures and faiths'
p16524

aS'the fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels'
p16681
aS'and the traditional tools of military intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight'
p16682
aS'mr speaker we have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it'
p16683
aS'the need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation'
p16684
aS'and base it on a policy that isolates those who harbour support and sponsor terrorists that does not distinguish between good and bad terrorists and that delinks religion from terrorism'
p16685
aS'also for us to succeed those who believe in humanity must come together to fight for it as one and speak against this menace in one voice'

p16707
aS'mr speaker and distinguished membersas we deepen our partnership there would be times when we would have differing perspectives'
p16708

aS'so as we embark on a new journey and seek new goals let us focus not just on matters routine but transformational ideas'
p16710
aS'ideas which can focus not just on creating wealth but also creating value for our societies not just on immediate gains but also long term benefits not just on sharing best practices but also shaping partnerships and not just on building a bright future for our peoples but in being a bridge to a more united humane and prosperous world'

aS'new rules are increasing the representation of women on corporate boards of directors'
p16815
aS'agriculture remains indias mainstay in terms of providing livelihood'
p16816
aS'there was a tendency to deprive farmers of subsidized fertilizer by diverting it for the production of chemicals'
p16817
aS'a simple but very effective solution is neem-coating of fertilizer which makes it unsuitable for diversion'
p16818
aS'we have moved towards universal neem-coating of urea'
p16819
aS'it has already saved crores of rupees of diverted farm subsidies and improved fertilizer availability to farmers'
p16820
aS'it is an example of how simple reforms can be very effective'
p16821
aS'we have introduced a soil health card nationally which tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil'
p16822
aS'it enables the farmer to choose the best crop and right quantity and mix of inputs'
p16823
aS'this greatly reduces wastage of inputs and increases crop yield besides protecting the soil'
p16824
aS'by reducing unnecessary chemical inputs it is also good for health of consumers'
p16825
aS'it reduces costs increases yields improves the environment and protects the health of consumers'
p16826
aS'140 million soil health cards will be issued requiring a collection of over twenty-five million soil samples and tested through a nationwide network of nearly 1500 laboratories'
p16827
aS'this brings me to an achievement that i think even our worst critics do not dispute'
p16828
aS'this is the change in levels of corruption'
p16829
aS'for many years economists and other experts have held corruption to be one of the main constraints on the growth of any developing economy'
p16830
aS'we have taken decisive steps to curb corruption'
p16831
aS'i have already referred to what has been done in public sector banks'
p16832
aS'we removed discretion in allocation of key resources and moved to transparent auctions of mines spectrum and fm radio licenses and we have plugged leakage through direct benefit transfer'
p16833
aS'we have revamped our personnel management to ensure that senior positions are held by persons of integrity'
p16834
aS'we have launched an on-going campaign against tax evasion and black money'
p16835
aS'the poor are the greatest beneficiaries of the reduction in corruption'
p16836
aS'looking to the future let me outline what i see as the path we will follow in the coming years'
p16837
aS'firstly we will continue to have disciplined and prudent macro-economic policies'
p16838
aS'i firmly believe that sound macro-economic fundamentals are a necessary foundation for long term sustainable growth'
p16839
aS'secondly we will combine this with a continued stress on inclusion and equity'
p16840
aS'this is to ensure the fruits of development accrue not to a few not to many but to all indians'
p16841
aS'and this will also mean continuing our attack on corruption'
p16842
aS'thirdly we will continue to make progress on improving the investment climate and ease of doing business'
p16843
aS'we want to make india a destination which not only welcomes business but where it is easy to do business'
p16844
aS'we have largely achieved the first by drastically liberalizing our foreign direct investment policies'
p16845
aS'we have made a good beginning on the second and will continue to make further improvements'
p16846
aS'we will continue to strengthen the make in india initiative'
p16847
aS'it is not intended for only manufacturing for the domestic market or import substitution'
p16848
aS'it is as much about making world-class products and services for the whole globe'
p16849
aS'that is why for us improvements towards free trade are important'
p16850
aS'it is very important for us that developed countries open their markets not only to goods from countries like india but also to services'
p16851
aS'i see this as a win-win proposition for the u'
p16852
aS's'
p16853
aS'and for india'
p16854
aS'india is the future human resource powerhouse of the world with a young hard-working population'
p16855
aS'in my vision a partnership between american capital and innovation and indian human resources and entrepreneurship can be very powerful'
p16856
aS'i am convinced we can strengthen both our economies through such a partnership'
p16857
aS'we will continue to make our tax policies more predictable'
p16858
aS'we have made major strides towards predictability by signing a number of advance pricing agreements with the united states'
p16859
aS'we are committed to taking this further'
p16860
aS'at the same time like the u'
p16861
aS's'
p16862
aS'we are cracking down on tax evasion and unfair tax avoidance'
p16863
aS'we will continue to open up our defence sector'
p16864
aS'i am aware that licensing policies can sometimes slow down the process of investing in indias defence sector'
p16865
aS'we are exploring a simpler and more efficient project licensing approach for defence'
p16866
aS'in the field of nuclear energy we are purchasing six nuclear reactors from westinghouse which will mark a new era in our nuclear and scientific cooperation'
p16867
aS'i was delighted when ge became one of the first companies to make a major investment in the newly liberalized railway sector'
p16868
aS'it is setting up a locomotive manufacturing plant in the relatively poor state of bihar'
p16869
aS'i expect many more such investments'
p16870
aS'the river ganga has a special significance for india'
p16871
aS'the namami gange programme to clean the river ganga is on the verge of taking off'
p16872
aS'it will be a big priority over the coming years'
p16873
aS'this project offers major opportunities for american companies with their expertise in environmental engineering water and sewage treatment and the like'
p16874
aS'this project is a high priority for my government and our aim is to restore the ganga to its pristine glory'
p16875

p16876
aS'a transformed india with one sixth of humanity will mean a transformed world'

p16962
aS'however the past two weeks have been the harbinger of the welcome news of rainfall from different places bringing in its wake a feeling of freshness'
p16963
aS'you too must have felt it'
p16964
aS'going by the predictions of the scientists this time there should be good rainfall far and wide and throughout the rainy season'
p16965
aS'this news in itself charges us with a lotof enthusiasm'
p16966
aS'i extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall'
p16967
aS'in our country like the toiling farmers our scientists are also achieving success on many fronts to take our country to new heights'
p16968
aS'i have believed it right from the beginning that the new generation should nurture the dream of becoming scientists should have keen interest in science and our youngsters should step forward with the zeal to do something for the coming generations'
p16969
aS'i also want to share another bright news with you'
p16970
aS'yesterday i had gone to pune on the occasion ofthe anniversary of the smart city project'
p16971
aS'over there i met those students of the pune college of engineering who on their own have made a satellite which was launched on 22nd june'
p16972
aS'i had called them to meet me as i had a wish to see these young friends of mine to interact with them and to experience firsthand the energy and enthusiasm within them'
p16973
aS'for the past many years several students have made their contributions to this project'
p16974
aS'in a way this academic satellite is aliving example of the soaring flight of courage and ambition of the young india'
p16975
aS'that has led these our students to make this satellite'
p16976
aS'the dreams behind this small satellite are big and lofty they soar high into the sky the efforts put in by them are very intense'
p16977
aS'on similar lines as achieved by these pune students the students of satyabhama university of chennai in tamil nadu also created their satellite and their sathyabamasat has also been launched'
p16978
aS'we have been hearing these thingssince childhood and every child wishes deep inside his heart to touch the sky and grab a few stars'
p16979
aS'keeping this in mind in my opinion these two satellites made by the students and launched by isro are extremely important and most valuable'
p16980
aS'all these students deserve hearty congratulations'
p16981
aS'i also want to congratulate the people of the country that on 22nd june our scientists at isro launched 20 satellites simultaneously into space and in the process set a new record breaking their own previous records'
p16982
aS'and this is also a matter of joy that of the twenty satellites which were launched in india 17 satellites were from other countries'
p16983
aS'along with america the satellites of many other countries were launched on indian soil by indian scientists and along with these those two satellites made by our students also reached outer space'
p16984
aS'and it is also noteworthy that owing to its guarantee of success with lesser cost isro has carved its specialplace in the world'
p16985
aS'and for this very reason many countries of the world are today looking towards india for the launching of their satellites'
p16986
aS'my dear countrymen save the girl child educate the girl child beti bachao beti padhao has already become the mann ki baat the heartfelt wish of all the people of india'
p16987
aS'still some incidents infuse a new life into this slogan'
p16988
aS'this time in the results of 10th and 12th classes our daughters have been doing wonderfully well which is a matter of pride'
p16989
aS'and my dear countrymen there is another significant event that all of us should take pride in'
p16990
aS'on 18th june the indian airforce for the very first time inducted its first batch of women fighter pilots'
p16991
aS'you get goose pimples just at the mention of women fighter pilots we feel so proud that these three flying officer daughters of ours- avni chaturvedi bhawna kanth and mohana have achieved this great feat'
p16992
aS'what these three daughters have accomplished is truly special'
p16993
aS'flying officer avni is from rewa in madhya pradesh flying officer bhawana is from begusarai in bihar and flying officermohana is from vadodara in gujarat'
p16994
aS'you must have noticed that all these three daughters do not hail from metro cities of india'
p16995
aS'they do not even come from the capital cities of their respective states'
p16996
aS'despite hailing from small cities and towns they nurtured dreams as high as the sky and they also made them come true'
p16997
aS'i extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters avni bhawana and mohana as well as their parents'
p16998
aS'my dear countrymen a few days ago on 21st june the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the international day for yoga'
p16999
aS'as an indian when we witness the entire world coming together through yoga we realize that the entire world is getting linked with our past present and future'
p17000
aS'we are forging a unique bond with the rest of the world'
p17001
aS'in india too the international yoga day was celebrated at over 1 lakh places with a lot of fervour andenthusiasm in myriad forms and hues and in an atmosphere of gaiety'
p17002
aS'i also got an opportunity to perform yoga in chandigarh amidst thousands of yoga lovers'
p17003
aS'it was worth watching the zeal of the young and old alike'
p17004
aS'you must have seen that last week the indian government issued a postage stamp on surya namaskar on the occasion of international yoga day'
p17005
aS'this time people all over the world on yoga day were witness to two special events'
p17006
aS'one was at new york city wherethe united nations organisation -uno head quarters building is located'
p17007
aS'a special projection depicting different postures of the various yoga asanas was organized on top of that building'
p17008
aS'and passersby kept taking pictures of these and these pictures soon were being shared all over the world'
p17009
aS'tell me which indian would not feel proud at such happenings'
p17010
aS'one more interesting thing happened'
p17011
aS'technology is at work'
p17012
aS'social media has created an identity of its own'
p17013
aS'and this timetwitter carried out a light hearted pleasant experiment in yoga with its yoga imaging'
p17014
aS'as soon as we typed hash tag yoga day we would immediately get a picture of a yoga image on our mobile'
p17015
aS'and this image too went viral all over the world'
p17016
aS'yoga by itself means adding - getting connected'
p17017
aS'yoga has the power to connect the entire world'
p17018
aS'but for that to happen first all of us need to get connected to yoga'
p17019
aS'swati srivastava from satna in madhya pradesh called me up on telephone after the yoga day and left a message for all of you but it seems that it pertains more to me -sound byte i wish that my entire country should be healthy and all the poor people also should remain free from diseases'
p17020
aS'for this i want that among the many ads that are played on doordarshan there should be one ad on yoga how it is to be done and what are its benefits'
p17021
aS'swati ji your suggestion is very good but if you observe carefully you will notice that not just on doordarshan but these days in india and outside india too the indian t'
p17022
ag720
aS'channels and channels of other countries are pitching in with their contribution to propagate yoga'
p17023
aS'they all are shown at different times but if you watch carefully all these things are being done to disseminate information about yoga'
p17024
aS'and i have seen that there are some countries in the world which have t'
p17025
aS'v'
p17026
aS'channels exclusively dedicated to yoga 24 hours a day'
p17027
aS'and you probably know that during the month of june in view of the international yoga day i used to share a video everyday of one particular asana of yoga through twitter and face book'
p17028
aS'if you go to the website of the ministry of ayush you will see available there a 40-45 minutes very good video demonstrating one after another different kinds of yog asanas for different parts of the body that you can do people of all ages can do'
p17029
aS'to you and through you to all the people interested in yoga i would like to exhort to get connected to it'
p17030
aS'this time i have made an appeal'
p17031
aS'when we say that yoga is a way to rid oneself of illnesses then why dont we bring together all the different schools of thought of yoga which have their own methods their own priorities and their own experiences'
p17032
aS'but all of them share the same final goal'
p17033
aS'all the prevalent systems of yoga all the functioning yoga institutions all the different yoga gurus i have urged all of them to run a successful campaign this entire year on how to defeatdiabetes through yoga'
p17034
aS'can we control diabetes through yoga'
p17035
aS'some people have been successful in that'
p17036
aS'everyone has searched for a wayin this regard'
p17037
aS'and we know that there is no definite cure for diabetes'
p17038
aS'one has to manage it with medicines'
p17039
aS'diabetes is the master switch that triggers all other illnesses'
p17040
aS'it becomes an entrance for many other diseases'
p17041
aS'and so everyone is wary of diabetes'
p17042
aS'a lot of people have worked in this direction'
p17043
aS'some diabetic patients have also been able to controlit thorough their yogic practice'
p17044
aS'why dont we share our experiences with other people to impart a momentum to this endeavour and create a kind of atmosphere for it for an entire year'
p17045
aS'i urge you to use hashtag yoga fights diabetes i repeat- hashtag yoga fights diabetes'
p17046
aS'use this twitter handle and share your experiences on social media'
p17047
aS'or send them to me on narendramodiapp'
p17048
aS'let us see what the various experiences are'
p17049
aS'at least give it a try'
p17050
aS'i invite you to shareyour experiences on hashtag yoga fights diabetes'
p17051
aS'my dear countrymen sometimes my mann ki baat is ridiculed a lot and is criticized much also'
p17052
aS'however this can only happen because all of us are committed to democracy'
p17053
aS'but today as i speak to you on 26th june and i want to especially say this to the new generation that this democracy that we take pride in this democracy that has granted great power to us every citizen has been empowered'
p17054
ag449
ag449
aS'but 26th june 1975 was also a day'
p17055
ag449
ag449
aS'the night of 25th june and the next morning wasa dark hour for the democracy of india when emergency was imposed in india'
p17056
aS'all the rights of the citizens were suspended'
p17057
aS'the country was turned into a prison'
p17058
aS'lakhs of people along with jai prakash narain thousands of leaders many organisations were put behind bars'
p17059
aS'many books have been written on that dark period'
p17060
aS'many discussions have been held on it'
p17061
aS'but today as i talk to you all on 26th june we should not forget that our strength lies in our democracy'
p17062
aS'our strength lies in thepeoples power'
p17063
aS'our strength lies in each and every citizen of our country'
p17064
aS'we have to carry forward this commitment and make it stronger'
p17065
aS'and it is this peoples power which has sustained democracy as its living embodiment'
p17066
aS'there might have been locks on newspaper houses radio might have been speaking just one kind of language still on the other hand given the opportune moment the citizens give an example of the power of democracy'
p17067
aS'a great example of the democraticstrength of the common people was witnessed during emergency'
p17068
aS'and we must keep reminding our country of its democratic strength from time to time'
p17069
aS'and our endeavour should be to make people aware of their power and to always have the tendency to further strengthen it by linking more and more people to it'
p17070
aS'i always stress that democracy doesnt merely mean that people vote for you and give you the contract to run this country for five years'
p17071
aS'certainly not'
p17072
aS'voting is certainly animportant component but there are many other facets of democracy'
p17073
aS'and the biggest dimension is that of peoples participation their attitude their thinking'
p17074
aS'and the more the governments get connected with the people the stronger they become'
p17075
aS'the chasm between the governments and the people leads to ruin'
p17076
aS'my endeavour has always been to ensure that the nation moves forward on the strength of peoples participation'
p17077
aS'recently when my government completed two years of functioning some young people of modern thinking suggested when you talk such big things about democracy then why dont you get your government rated by the people also'
p17078
aS'in a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice'
p17079
aS'but that stirred my mind'
p17080
aS'i raised this topic with some of my senior colleagues'
p17081
aS'their first reaction was oh no'
p17082
aS'sir'
p17083
aS'what are you thinking of doing'
p17084
aS'these days technology has changed so much that ifpeople get together and form a group and if they decide to misuse technology then who knows in which direction they might take forward this survey'
p17085
aS'they thus expressed their concern'
p17086
aS'but i felt no we should go ahead even if it is a risk'
p17087
aS'we should give it a try and see what happens'
p17088
aS'now a lot of surveys are conducted after the elections during the elections at other times also over some issues sometimes to gauge the popularity but the sample size of these surveys is not verybig'
p17089
aS'however my dear countrymen i am happy to state that when i through the medium of technology using different languages appealed to the masses to rate my government a lot of people amongst you have expressed your opinion on rate-my-government-mygov'
p17090
aS'in'
p17091
aS'lakhs of you displayed your interest in this but 3 lakh people devoted their time and put in serious effort for giving an answer to each and every question'
p17092
aS'i am grateful to these 3 lakh people that they displayed a lot ofself initiative in rating the government'
p17093
aS'i wont discuss the results'
p17094
aS'our media persons are sure to do that'
p17095
aS'but i can say for sure that it was a good experiment'
p17096
aS'and this was a matter of joy for me that people speaking all the languages of india residing in every corner of the country hailing from all types of background'
p17097
ag449
ag449
aS'all of them participated in it'
p17098
aS'and the biggest thing was'
p17099
ag449
ag449
aS'and this of course came as a surprise to me'
p17100
ag449
ag449
aS'that maximum number of people took part in thisexercise through the portal of the website of the rural employment scheme which is being run by the government'
p17101
aS'thus my primary impression is that there has been a large and active participation of people connected to rural india and poverty issues'
p17102
aS'this i liked the most'
p17103
aS'so you have seen that while on 26th june some years ago the voice of the people was stifled now is the time when the people make their decisions they judge whether the government is doing the right thing or not is performing well or poorly'
p17104
aS'this is the real power of democracy'
p17105
aS'my dear countrymen today i want to make a special appeal for one thing'
p17106
aS'there was a time when taxes were so pervasive that it became a habit to avoid taxation'
p17107
aS'there was a time when there were many restrictions imposed on bringing foreign goods into the country which gave rise to a lot of smuggling'
p17108
aS'but gradually times have changed'
p17109
aS'now it is not very difficult for the taxpayer to get connected with the taxation system of the government'
p17110
aS'but even then old habits die hard'
p17111
aS'onegeneration still feels that it is best to keep away from the government'
p17112
aS'today i want to impress upon you that we end up losing our peace of mind by trying to escape from rules and regulations'
p17113
aS'as a result anybody can trouble and harass us'
p17114
aS'why should we let this happen'
p17115
aS'why dont we on our own give the correct details of our income and property to the government so that we can rid ourselves from the burden of hitherto undeclared assets'
p17116
aS'i appeal to the countrymen to dothis'
p17117
aS'to the people who have undisclosed income the government of india has given a chance to declare such income'
p17118
aS'the government has presented before the country a special facility to disclose undisclosed income by the 30th of september'
p17119
aS'we can be free ourselves of various burdens just by paying a fine'
p17120
aS'i have also promised that for those who voluntarily declare to the government their assets and their undisclosed income then the government will not conduct any kind of enquiry'
p17121
aS'not once will it be asked as to from where all this wealth came and how it was acquired'
p17122
aS'and so this is a good chance for you to become a part of a transparent system'
p17123
aS'at the same time i want to tell the people of the country that pleaseconsider this plan which is up to 30th september as your last chance'
p17124
aS'in between i had even told the members of the parliament that after 30th september if any citizen is put through any difficulty the one who does not want to follow due rules of government then it will not be possible to help them'
p17125
aS'i want to say this to the people of the country that we do not wish that after the 30th september anything should happen that will cause difficulties for you'
p17126
aS'and so i say that please availof this facility before this date and save yourselves from any possible trouble after the 30th of september'
p17127
aS'my dear countrymen i had to talk about this in mann ki baat today because recently i held a two-day conclave with the revenue departments- all the officials of the income tax customs and excise departments'
p17128
aS'and i have told them in clear words that we should not perceive citizens as crooks'
p17129
aS'we should have trust and faith in the citizens'
p17130
aS'we should hold hands with them'
p17131
aS'if they want to follow rules we should encourage them and lovingly help them cross over'
p17132
aS'it is important to buildan atmosphere of trust'
p17133
aS'we shall have to bring about a change through our conduct'
p17134
aS'we shall have to reassure the taxpayer'
p17135
aS'i stressed this upon them and i noticed that they too realized that today when the nation is surging ahead all of us must contribute to it'
p17136
aS'and when i was taking inputs from them in this conclave i gathered information which i want to share with you as well'
p17137
aS'none of you will believe that in a country of 125 crore people one and a half only one and a half lakhpeople exist whose taxable income is more than 50 lakh rupees'
p17138
aS'nobody will be able to swallow something like this'
p17139
aS'people having a taxable income of more than 50 lakh rupees can be seen in big cities in large numbers'
p17140
aS'just looking at their bungalows worth 1 or 2 crores one wonders how they can be in a tax bracket of less than 50 lakhs'
p17141
aS'this means that there is something wrong somewhere'
p17142
aS'we have to change this situation'
p17143
aS'and this has to change before 30th september'
p17144
aS'before takingany extreme steps the government must give a chance to the people'
p17145
aS'and so my dear brothers and sisters this is a golden chance for you to disclose your undisclosed income'
p17146
aS'and in another way this is the way out to save yourself from any trouble that could arise after 30th september'
p17147
aS'i urge you to come forth in this task for the betterment of our country for the upliftment of the poor'
p17148
aS'and i do not want that you should face any problems after 30th september'
p17149
aS'my dear countrymen the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country'
p17150
aS'when i asked the people to give up their cooking gas subsidy more than 1 crore families of this country voluntarily gave up their subsidy'
p17151
aS'and now i want to cite an example especially for those people who have undisclosed income'
p17152
aS'yesterday when i went to pune for the smart city programme over there i got the chance to meet shri chandrakant damodar kulkarniand his family'
p17153
aS'i had called them especially to meet me'
p17154
aS'and what was the reason'
p17155
aS'anyone who has ever evaded tax my words may or may not inspire that person but the example of shri chandrakant kulkarni is sure to inspire him'
p17156
aS'do you know what the reason is'
p17157
aS'shri chandrakant kulkarni is an ordinary man who belongs to an average middle class family'
p17158
aS'he used to work for the government'
p17159
aS'then he retired'
p17160
aS'he receives a pension of sixteen thousand rupees'
p17161
aS'and my dear countrymen you will besurprised to hear and those who are in the habit of evading tax will get a shock to know that chandrakant kulkarni ji who gets a pension of only rupees sixteen thousand some time back wrote a letter to me saying that out of his pension of 16000 he voluntarily wants to donate rs'
p17162
aS'5000 per month for the cleanliness campaign'
p17163
aS'and not just this he sent me 52 cheques post dated which bear a date for each forthcoming month'
p17164
aS'we certainly do not have any right to evade tax in thiscountry where there is one such government employee who after retirement out of a pension of mere sixteen thousand rupees gives five thousand for the cleanliness campaign'
p17165
aS'no one could be a greater source of inspiration than chandrakant kulkarni'
p17166
aS'and for the people who are associated with the cleanliness campaign also there could be no better inspiring example than chandrakant kulkarni'
p17167
aS'i called chandrakantji face to face'
p17168
aS'i met him and his life has touched my heart'
p17169
aS'i express myfelicitations and admiration for the kulkarni family i congratulate them'
p17170
aS'and surely there must be countless people like them about whom i have no information'
p17171
aS'these are the very people'
p17172
ag449
ag449
aS'and this is the power and strength of the masses'
p17173
aS'a man with a pension of sixteen thousand rupees sends me cheques worth two lakhs sixty thousand in advance is this a small thing'
p17174
aS'come let us search deep down inside our hearts and ponder over the fact that the government has given us anopportunity to disclose our incomes'
p17175
aS'while thinking of chandrkant kulkarni let us also follow him'
p17176
aS'my dear countrymen santosh negi from pauri garhwal in uttarakhand has called up to relate one of his experiences'
p17177
aS'he has given a message regarding water conservation'
p17178
aS'friends his experience can be of use to you as well -sound byte drawing inspiration from you in our school before the onset of monsoon we dug 250 small trenches which were 4 feet deep along the side of the playground so that rainwater could be collected in these'
p17179
aS'this way the play ground remained unspoilt and there was no danger of children drowning in these'
p17180
ag449
ag449
aS'and we managed to save crores of litres of rainwater which fell on the playfield'
p17181
aS'santoshji i would like to thank you for sending me this message'
p17182
aS'pauri garhwal is a hilly area where you have done such splendid work'
p17183
aS'you deserve congratulations for that'
p17184
aS'the people of our country should certainly enjoy the rains but let us also be mindful that this is a holy gift from the almighty'
p17185
aS'this is a limitless wealth'
p17186
aS'we should make every effort to conserve every single drop of water'
p17187
aS'how can we retain the rainwater of the villages there itself and similarly preserverainwater of cities therein'

p17190
aS'water is the basis of all life'
p17191
aS'an atmosphere has certainly been created in the country'
p17192
aS'lately in all the states a lot of measures have been taken for water conservation'
p17193
aS'but now that we are going to have the bounty of rain water we must see to it that it doesnt just flow away'
p17194
aS'we are so concerned about savinglives we should be equally concerned about saving water'
p17195

p17623
aS'asante sana dhanyavaad'
p17624
aS'thank you very much'
p17625
aS'chief ministers and lt'
p17626
aS'governors of states and union territories and my cabinet colleagues i welcome you all to this important meeting of the inter state council'
p17627
aS'there are only a few occasions when the leadership of the centre and the states assembles together'
p17628
aS'this forum of cooperative federalism is the perfect setting to deliberate on the interests of the people address their problems and take collective and concrete decisions'
p17629
aS'it highlights the vision of the makers of our constitution'
p17630
aS'let me begin by recalling what our beloved former prime minister shri atal bihari vajpayee ji had said at this very forum sixteen years ago in a democracy as big and diverse as ours debate deliberation and discussion help evolve policy that relates to the ground reality'
p17631
aS'more importantly they enable the effective implementation of such policies'
p17632
aS'the inter-state council is an inter-governmental forum that can be used for evolving policy as well as ensuring its implementation'
p17633
aS'i therefore urge the states to increasingly use this forum as an effective instrument to strengthen our democracy our society and our polity'
p17634
aS'the inter-state council is certainly the most significant platform for strengthening centre-state and inter-state relations'
p17635
aS'there has been a long hiatus since the last meeting in 2006 but i am happy that through the efforts of home minister rajnath singh ji the process has been restarted'
p17636
aS'over the last one year he has convened meetings of five zonal councils'
p17637
aS'the increased dialogue and connect has culminated in this gathering today'
p17638
aS'the nation can progress only if the union and state governments walk shoulder to shoulder'
p17639
aS'it would be difficult for any government to successfully implement a scheme on its own'
p17640
aS'therefore provision of adequate financial resources is as important as the responsibility for implementation'
p17641
aS'with the acceptance of the 14th finance commission recommendations the states share in central taxes has increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent'
p17642
aS'this means that states now have greater financial resources to utilize in accordance with their requirements'
p17643
aS'i am happy to share that the total amount received by states from the centre during 2015-16 is 21 per cent higher than the amount received in 2014-15'
p17644
aS'similarly panchayats and urban local bodies will receive 2'
p17645
aS'87 lakh crore rupees during the period of the 14th finance commission which is substantially higher than last time'
p17646
aS'the rights of states have been kept in mind even in revenue received from the auction of natural resources auctions of coal blocks will yield 3'
p17647
aS'35 lakh crore rupees to states in the years to come'
p17648
aS'auctions of other mines will yield an additional 18000 crore rupees to states'
p17649
aS'similarly through amendments to campa act we are attempting to free up about 40000 crore rupees lying idle in banks for disbursal to states'
p17650
aS'the union government also wishes to share with states the amount that is being saved as a result of transparency being introduced into the system'
p17651
aS'kerosene is one example'
p17652
aS'electricity connections are increasing in villages'
p17653
aS'the union government will provide 5 crore new cooking gas connections over the next three years'
p17654
aS'the supply of lpg will further increase'
p17655
aS'all these efforts have a direct bearing on the consumption of kerosene'
p17656
aS'recently the chandigarh administration declared the city a kerosene-free zone'
p17657
aS'now the union government has launched a scheme under which if there is a reduction in the consumption of kerosene by a state the centre will disburse 75 per cent of the resultant savings in subsidy as grant to that state'
p17658
aS'the government of karnataka while moving swiftly on this initiative has sent its proposal to the petroleum ministry'
p17659
aS'this has been accepted and the grant has been disbursed to the state government'
p17660
aS'if all states decide to reduce kerosene consumption by 25 per cent and actually do so they can receive about 1600 crore rupees as grant this year'
p17661
aS'apart from centre-state relations the inter state council is an appropriate forum to discuss matters which are of concern to large segments of our population'
p17662
aS'how can we evolve consensus at the policy formulation stage'
p17663
aS'how can we address issues of mutual interest'
p17664
aS'therefore in this meeting of the inter state council besides the punchhi commission report three very important subjects have also been added to the agenda'
p17665
aS'one of these is aadhaar'
p17666
aS'parliament has passed the aadhaar act-2016'
p17667
aS'the passage of this act enables us to use aadhaar for direct cash transfers for subsidy and other services'
p17668
aS'as on date 102 crore aadhaar cards have been distributed in our country of 128 crore people'
p17669
aS'79 per cent of our people now have aadhaar cards'
p17670
aS'among adults 96 per cent people have aadhaar cards'
p17671
aS'with your support we shall connect every citizen of the country with an aadhaar card by the year-end'
p17672
aS'today the simple aadhaar card has become a symbol of empowerment'
p17673
aS'benefits now flow only to people genuinely entitled to receive them with money getting directly credited to their bank accounts'
p17674
aS'this has not only brought in transparency but also resulted in savings of thousands of crores of rupees which are being utilized for development'
p17675
aS'friends babasaheb ambedkar had written the path of social reform like the path to heaven at any rate in india is strewn with many difficulties'
p17676
aS'social reform in india has few friends and many critics'
p17677
aS'the words written by him continue to be relevant even today'
p17678
aS'therefore eschewing criticism we must lay emphasis on promoting social reform schemes through mutual cooperation'
p17679
aS'many of these schemes have been designed by sub-groups of chief ministers under the aegis of the niti aayog'
p17680
aS'another important area of discussion in the inter state council is education'
p17681
aS'indias greatest asset is its youth'
p17682
aS'more than 30 crore children are currently of school-going age'
p17683
aS'hence our country has the potential to provide the world with skilled manpower for many years to come'
p17684
aS'the centre and the states must work together to provide our children an enabling environment in which they can develop their skills and prepare themselves for todays needs'
p17685
aS'in the words of pt'
p17686
aS'deen dayal upadhyay education is an investment'
p17687
aS'while planting trees we do not charge them any fee'
p17688
aS'we are aware that these trees will give us oxygen in the future and benefit the environment'
p17689
aS'likewise education is also an investment that benefits the society'
p17690
aS'pt'
p17691
aS'deen dayal upadhyay ji said this in 1965'
p17692
aS'since then we have come a long way in terms of education'
p17693
aS'but a lot still remains to be done with regard to the standard of education'
p17694
aS'we must discuss the extent to which our system of education is genuinely educating our children'
p17695
aS'the best way of improving the standard of education among children is to make them aware of the purpose of education'
p17696
aS'merely going to school is not education'
p17697
aS'education should generate curiosity among children'
p17698
aS'it should teach them how to attain and enhance knowledge'
p17699
aS'it should motivate them to continuously keep learning throughout their lives'
p17700
aS'swami vivekananda also used to say that education does not mean merely attaining bookish knowledge'
p17701
aS'the aim of education is character building'
p17702
aS'education means strengthening the mind and enhancing ones intellect so that one can become self-reliant'
p17703
aS'given the kind of efficiency and ability that is required in the economy of the 21st century it is our responsibility to ensure that our youth are equipped with at least some skill-sets'
p17704
aS'we have to prepare our youth to think logically think out of the box and work creatively'
p17705
aS'internal security is another important issue on the agenda today'
p17706
aS'we have to discuss internal security challenges confronting the country the solutions to these challenges and mutual cooperation in this regard'
p17707
aS'the internal security of the country can not be strengthened until we focus on intelligence sharing ensure greater coordination among agencies and equip our police with modern approach and technology'
p17708
aS'while we have come a long way we need to continuously increase our efficiency and capacity'
p17709
aS'we must constantly remain alert and updated'
p17710
aS'the meeting of the inter state council provides an opportunity for exchange of views in an extremely free and frank manner'
p17711
aS'i am sure you will share your thoughts and suggestions on all the agenda items'
p17712
aS'these will be of tremendous value'
p17713
aS'the more we are able to forge consensus on these vital issues the better we shall be able to tackle them'
p17714
aS'in doing so we shall not only strengthen the spirit of cooperative federalism and centre-state relations but also secure a better future for our citizens'
p17715
aS'all the honourable spiritual masters and saints worth remembering in everyday morning and all the ardent devotees present here'
p17716
aS'its my privilege that today ive got the opportunity to unveil the statue of inspirational personality most worshippable mahant avaidyanath ji maharaj as well as to receive the blessings of all of you'
p17717
aS'this soil of gorakhpur holds a uniqueness in the sense be it lord budhha mahavira or kabir all of them had an unbreakable bond with this in one or another way'
p17718
aS'the glorious tradition of guru gorakshanath ji gorakhnath ji was started with the great vision of upliftment and advancement of not just the individuals but also of the society as a whole'
p17719
aS'often some ills or hurdles start gradually creeping into the traditions prevailing in the society over a long period of time'
p17720
aS'however if the ideals and rules of the traditions are fully observed then it becomes possible to keep the traditions free from the circumstantial pressures'
p17721
aS'gujarat boasts plenty of places linked with the brilliant tradition initiated by gorakhnath ji'
p17722
aS'while being in gujarat once i was sitting with mahant avaidyanath ji as my association with him goes back to the time even when i was not active in the politics'
p17723
aS'at that time i came to know from him how in this time-honoured tradition the entire system is conducted in an organised way how its rules and policies are complied with how the full information of the associated saints is retained irrespective of the place of the world they stay at how they are rendered financial support in time of rainy days'
p17724
aS'since a long time the gorakhnath tradition has been successfully kept alive and the credit goes to the signal contribution of those great personas who have got the good fortune to serve on this seat of monastery'
p17725
aS'be it the freedom struggle of india or the significant task of social reconstruction post-independence mahant avaidyanath ji played an active role in both time phases'
p17726
aS'he had added an another dimension to his life by his vision to ignite the social consciousness through pilgrimage centre remaining within the democratic purviews and then provide the common people benefits of transformed situation'
p17727
aS'this vision is being successfully kept up with and carried forward even today by his disciple yogi adityanath ji'
p17728
aS'all the saint traditions mathas monastic establishments and akharas religious bodies of india look sometimes fairly distinct and conflicting from the outside'
p17729
aS'despite that one thing is inherently common among all of them that is never a poor or starving person returns hungry from their doors'
p17730
aS'no matter a saint has something or not in the life if he is sitting in a hut his first question from the approaching devotee is would you like to take the prasadam food offered to the god'
p17731
aS'such sorts of great traditions spring up out of the deep sensitivity towards the society and for that reason such traditions inspire us devote our life and systems for the welfare and wellbeing of others'
p17732
aS'and it is the success mantra of our age-old indian traditions to last long proving their relevance in contemporary time periods'
p17733
aS'all the traditions in our country have undergone timely changes'
p17734
aS'they have embraced the science with open arms whenever they felt its need'
p17735
aS'even they have welcomed the shift in their social outlook'
p17736
aS'and ive witnessed that how so many saints and seers who were devoted to religious and spiritual works have nowadays attached themselves towards furthering social missions like swacch bharat abhiyan'
p17737
aS'ive even heard about the saints running campaign for building toilets and encouraging their devotees to do so'
p17738
aS'ive heard them making a heartfelt plea from the people to uphold the dignity of our mothers and sisters and take up the task to ensure that women live a respectful life'
p17739
aS'ive even seen so many saints who run eye surgery camps for rendering whatever support to the poorest of poor that they can'
p17740
aS'ive observed many saints who dedicate their lives for keeping animals healthy'
p17741
aS'be it education health or service in each spheres of life our saint tradition is getting involved today in one or other way'
p17742
aS'and it is the need of hour that lakhs of saints thousands of traditions and hundreds of monasteries come forward to play a pivotal role in making india modern and prosperous in cultivating good values among its citizens'
p17743
aS'many are already doing it'
p17744
aS'and it is something which augurs good signs for the future of india'

p17746
aS'he was deeply concerned towards it and used to make all-out efforts for exploring the ways to tackle social problems'
p17747
aS'encouraging and rewarding the people engaged in good deeds was his lifelong task'
p17748

p17757
aS'it is very sad to see that children are not able to study apple produce is not able to reach to the mandis shopkeepers are not getting their daily income and government offices are not able to implement works of public interest'

p17768
aS'jammu kashmir is often said as crown of india'
p17769
aS'in fact jammu kashmir is a symbol of age old commitment of equanimity towards all sects where hindus sikhs buddhists and muslims have been living together for centuries'
p17770
aS'the state of jammu kashmir is the symbol of our founding fathers faith which defines us as one indian in spite of our diversity'
p17771
aS'jammu kashmir is not only a matter of our territorial integrity but also defines our nationality'

aS'we can not deny the fact thatthe security forces have suffered all kinds of injuries and have been attacked in planned manner'
p17773
aS'in spite of all this our security forces have shown restraint'
p17774
aS'the figures show that security personnel have been injured in large numbers'
p17775
aS'even after misleading propaganda by certain elements in kashmir the percentage of those spreading confusion unrest and those instigating youth is very low in kashmir'
p17776
aS'every kashmiri wants peace has faith in democracy'

p17778
aS'even just before the recent disturbances highvoting was casts in the constituency of cm mehbooba ji'
p17779
aS'therefore it is far from being true to call it a public movement'
p17780
aS'in some areas certain prohibitions were imposed in order to maintain law and order'
p17781
aS'this is a legal way of maintaining law and order'
p17782
aS'otherwise the lives of peace loving people will be affected adversely'
p17783
aS'in reality a common man was not troubled as much by such prohibitions as he was troubled by continuous strikes declared by separatists elements'
p17784
aS'during this period the amarnath pilgrimage was going on nicely'
p17785
aS'in addition the state government continued to do special work on solar energy in laddakh region'

p17812
aS'it is also a reality that kashmiri pandits have been displaced from kashmir valley who have been living there for centuries in their ancestral home'
p17813
aS'this kind of atrocity against a particular community is the misdeed of terrorists trained and armed with weapons by pakistan and their sympathizers but definitely not the deeds of those who believe in kashmiriat'

aS'right from the vedas to vivekananda from the upanishads to the satellites the sudarshan chakradhari mohan to charkhadhari mohan from the bhim of mahabharat to the bhimrao we have a long historical journey and heritage'
p17853
aS'our land has seen many historical ups and downs and our generations have waged many struggles and observed penance to bequeath great values to the humanity'
p17854
aS'indias age is not just seventy years'
p17855
aS'but having won freedom after a period of subjugation we have made efforts to take the nation forward in this journey of seventy years'
p17856
aS'sardar vallabh bhai patel united the nation'
p17857
aS'now it is the responsibility of all of us to take make this nation better'
p17858
aS'we all have to work ceaselessly for the realization of the dream of one india supreme india'
p17859
aS'ek bharat shreshtha bharat'
p17860
aS'brothers and sisters we have not attained freedom for free of cost'
p17861
aS'innumerable were the atrocities but undeterred were our resolves also'
p17862
aS'every indian was a soldier in the battle for freedom'
p17863
aS'each one of them dreamt of an independent india'
p17864
aS'may be every one of them was not fortunate enough to sacrifice may be each of them was not fortunate enough to go to prison but every indian had a resolve and the leadership of mahatma ji and also the inspiration of countlessrevolutionaries who had sacrificed every thing'
p17865
aS'all these movements contributed to our attainment of independence'
p17866
aS'but now we have to convert this freedom into the real freedom'
p17867
aS'now this is the resolve of the one hundred and twenty five crores of indians'
p17868
aS'so just as we did not attain our freedom without sacrifices we would not be able to attain the real freedom without renunciation without human endeavour purusharth without bravery without dedication and discipline'
p17869
aS'so in order to take ahead this resolution of one hundred and twenty five crore indians all of us will have to move ahead with our specific responsibilities in a most committed manner'
p17870
aS'be it a panchayat or the parliament be it a village headman or the prime minister every one of us as well as every democratic institution will have to shoulder their responsibilities completely and perfectly'
p17871
aS'only then we will be able to realize the dream of our the real freedom as soon aspossible'
p17872
aS'this is correct to say that our nation is beset with many problems now- a- days'
p17873
aS'but we should never forget that if we have the problems then we also have all the capacities to solve them'
p17874
aS'so if we move ahead with all our capabilities we will find the ways and mean to solve all these problems'
p17875
aS'so brothers and sisters if we have lakhs of problems then we also have one hundred and twenty five crore brains also which are all capable to solve theseproblems'
p17876
aS'dear brothers sisters there was a time when government used to be surrounded by aspersions'
p17877
aS'but now time has changed'
p17878
aS'at present no aspersions are being leveled on the government'
p17879
aS'rather people have great expectations from it'
p17880
aS'when the government is engulfed in expectations then it signifies hope and trust which in turn generates those expectations'
p17881
aS'expectations give pace towards good governance invigorates and so the pledges are implemented ad continum'
p17882
aS'mybrothers sisters today when i am addressing you from the rampart of the red fort it is therefore but natural that we should discuss the journey of good governance the work done by the government and work being done and should be done for the country'
p17883
aS'i can present before you a very detailed account of work done and also multiple issues regarding the performance of the government'
p17884
aS'during the tenure of two years the government has taken innumerable initiatives andmultiple tasks have been done'
p17885
aS'if i start giving details about them i am afraid i will have to talk about it for a week from this very rampart of the red fort'
p17886
aS'so instead of that temptation i would like to draw your attention towards the work culture of the government'
p17887
aS'sometimes it is easier to present the account of work done'
p17888
aS'but it is not easy for a common man to comprehend understand and identify the work culture without dwelling deep into the work culture'
p17889
aS'my brothers sisters my countrymen i would not talk solely about the policy but also the intention and decisions of the government'
p17890
aS'dear brothers sisters it is just not an issue of direction and outline rather it is about holistic approach and a resolve for transformation'
p17891
aS'it is confluence of trinity of expectation of people democracy and support of people'
p17892
aS'it is both wisdom and consent'
p17893
aS'it is also pace and realisation of progress'
p17894
aS'therefore my countrymen when i talk about the good governance it does implies bringing in transformation in the life of common man of my country'
p17895
aS'good governance meansthat the government should be sensitive responsive and dedicated to the common man'
p17896
aS'then only good governance gets the emphasis'
p17897
aS'responsibility and accountability should be at the root of it and it should draw its vital energy from there only for the government to be sensitive dear brothers and sisters'
p17898
aS'we remember the days when there used to be a very long wait to go to any big hospital'
p17899
aS'people used to come to aiims spend two three days and then only it would be decided whatdiagnostic tests were to be done'
p17900
aS'now we have been able to change this system'
p17901
aS'registration is done online and the doctors appointment is also given online'
p17902
aS'the processes start on arrival of the patient at the appointed hour itself'
p17903
aS'not only this but all his medical records are also available online'
p17904
aS'and we wish to develop it as a countywide culture in the field of medical treatment'
p17905
aS'today this system has been put in place in 40 big hospitals of the country'
p17906
aS'its basic premiseis that the government has to be sensitive'
p17907
aS'dear brothers and sisters the government should be accountable'
p17908
aS'if it be not so then the problems of the common man are kept pending for solutions'
p17909
aS'how does the change come'
p17910
aS'now technology is there but there was a time when the railway ticket in the railways concerning the common man and the poor was available only two thousand tickets per minute'
p17911
aS'those who might have seen it would know how the buffering used to be there nobody knew when the website would be operationalagain but today i have to say with satisfaction that now it is possible to have fifteen thousand tickets per minute'
p17912
aS'the government should be accountable it should take steps according to the necessities and expectations of the people'
p17913
aS'there is a class across the country particularly the middle class higher middle class whom you see troubled more at the hands of the income tax officials rather than the police at times'
p17914
aS'i have to change the situation and i am trying andi will certainly change it'
p17915
aS'there was a time when a common and honest citizen used to give two rupees extra as a measure of caution at the time of paying his income tax'
p17916
aS'he used to think that he might not be harassed but once the money was deposited to the government exchequer he had to run from pillar to post and seek recommendations for getting the refund'
p17917
aS'it took months together before the rightful money of the citizen was returned to him from the government exchequer'
p17918
aS'today we have made a systemof issuing online refund'
p17919
aS'today refunds are given in one two say or three weeks'
p17920
aS'those who are hearing me today on tv they would also be realising that they had not given any application yet they had got refund directly into their account'
p17921
aS'so this responsibility and accountability are the results of these efforts'
p17922
aS'it is equally important to lay emphasis on the transparency for good governance'
p17923
aS'you know that a global relationship has already started to become a common thing in the society today'
p17924
aS'a middle class man wants to have his passport- there was a time when about 40 lakh 50lakh applications were received for getting passport'
p17925
aS'today approximately 2 crore people apply for the passport'
p17926
aS'brothers and sisters earlier 4-6 months were taken for scrutiny of applications if one did nothave recommendations'
p17927
aS'we changed that situation and today i can say with pride that passports are issued to the citizens with all genuine details in about one or two weeks and there is transparency no recommendation is required and there is no dilly-dallying'
p17928
aS'today i can say we have issued 1'
p17929
aS'75 crores passports in 2015-16 itself'
p17930
aS'in surajya there must be efficiency in governance and therefore earlier if a company had to set up a factory or desiring to do business in our country applications were submitted'
p17931
aS'there was a task of registration only one wanted to do something for the country but almost 6 months passed in normal course'
p17932
aS'brothers and sisters if efficiency is brought then the same government same rules same officials have got geared up to perform the same task of company registration within 24hours and they are virtually doing it'
p17933
aS'in the last july itself they performed the task of more than 900 such registrations'
p17934
aS'brothers and sisters good governance is also necessary for surajya and the steps we have taken towards this good governance are that as i had said last year from the red fort that we would exempt group c and group d posts from interviews they might get job on the basis of merit'
p17935
aS'we have detected almost 9000 posts for which thousands and lakhs of people need to be recruited'
p17936
aS'now there would not be any interview process for these 9000 posts my young men would not need tospend any money for interviews'
p17937
aS'recommendations would not be needed roads for corruption and agents will be shut and this work has been implemented'
p17938
aS'brothers and sisters there was a time when a common man got satisfied if the government announced any plan or merely announced that this would be done he used to think that something concrete would happen now'
p17939
aS'then a time came when people asked for the plan unless the drawing of the plan came'
p17940
aS'then there was a time when people asked for the budget'
p17941
aS'today the mood of the country has changed in 70 years'
p17942
aS'it does not get satisfied with the announcement it is notsatisfied by seeing the plan if a budget provision is made it is not ready to accept this'
p17943
aS'it is accepted when things get implemented on ground and we can not bring things on ground with the old pace'
p17944
aS'we have to speed up our work increase the pace further and then we can say that we have done something'
p17945
aS'rural roads are a perpetual issue in our country'
p17946
aS'each rural citizen craves for pakka roads'
p17947
aS'its a huge task'
p17948
aS'atal behari vajpayi ji took this task specifically'
p17949
aS'even succeding governments continued this and the work continued'
p17950
aS'we have made efforts to fast track it'
p17951
aS'earlier 70-75 km of rural roads were completed in a day'
p17952
aS'now we have increased that pace up to 100km a day'
p17953
aS'this pace will fulfil the aspirations of common man in the days to come'
p17954
aS'we have aid emphasis on energy specifically renewable energy in our country'
p17955
aS'that was a time when after so many years of independence we started working on wind energy'
p17956
aS'within a period of last one year we have increased it up to 40'
p17957
aS'so this is the scale of up acceleration'
p17958
aS'whole world is focussing on solar energy'
p17959
aS'we have increased it approximately 116 -118'
p17960
aS'this is not only a substantial incremental change its a huge leap forward'
p17961
aS'we intend to enhance the thingsin quantum way'
p17962
aS'in our country even before forming of our government we had the power production'
p17963
aS'but to reach the power you need transmission lines and the good transmission infrastructure'
p17964
aS'two years preceding the formation of our government30-35 thousand kilometres of transmission lines were being laid annually'
p17965
aS'today i wish to submit this with satisfaction that we have raised this to 50000 kilometres'
p17966
aS'so we have increased the pace here'
p17967
aS'if we take the commissioning of railway linesin previous 10 years where commissioning means capacity to ply the trains and to finish all the trials so earlier it was at the rate of 1500 kilometre in 10 years'
p17968
aS'but we have made it up to 3500 kilometre in last 2 years'
p17969
aS'we are to increase this pace even further'
p17970
aS'brothers and sisters now we are connecting government schemes to adhaar card focussing on stopping the leakages through direct benefit transfer'
p17971
aS'previous government had connected four crore people to government schemes via adhaar card'
p17972
aS'today i can say this with satisfaction that in place of that work of four crore we have completed the task of connecting 70 crore people to government schemes via adhaar card'
p17973
aS'the remaining will also be taken into the fold'
p17974
aS'today for middle class or for common people the ownership of a car is a matter of pride'
p17975
aS'there was a time when gas stove at home was deemed as a standard and as a symbol of social status'
p17976
aS'during the last 60 years of independence 14 crore lpg gas connections were given'
p17977
aS'brothers and sisters it is a great satisfaction to me that on one side 14 crore gas connections were given in 60 years while on the other side we have given 4 crore gas connections in just 60 weeks'
p17978
aS'please compare the two figures - 14 crore in 60 years and 4 crore in 60 weeks'
p17979
aS'this is the speed by which a change has become possible in the quality of life of common men'
p17980
aS'we have also started the task of eradicating obsolete laws'
p17981
aS'the burden of unnecessary laws has been creating hindrance in the functioning of the government the judiciary and the public'
p17982
aS'we have identified 1700 such laws out of which 1175 laws have already been repealed by the parliament and several othersuch laws are in the process of repealing'
p17983
aS'brothers and sisters it had become a tendency among the people to say that certain work can be done and certain other work can not be done certain work can not be done now and certain work can not be done ever'
p17984
aS'a kind of negativity was prevalent in the minds of people'
p17985
aS'now a clear break through is visible in the mindset a new synergy is seen in the functioning of the government'
p17986
aS'when an accomplishment is achieved it stimulates dynamism which sharpens our determination and then the end result is not far away'
p17987
aS'brothers and sisters when we had launched prime minister jan-dhan yojana it was almost an impossible task'
p17988
aS'there were banks and the governments nationalisation had already taken place but the common man of the country was not able to be a part of the mainstream of national economy'
p17989
aS'brothers and sisters we have attained this impossible task through inclusion of 21 crore persons under jan-dhan yojana'
p17990
aS'this is not a matter of taking credit by the government it is really an achievement of 125 crore countrymen of the country for which i salute them'
p17991
aS'the campaign for women pride in villages of the country is an important issue of today'
p17992
aS'the practice of open defecation should be stopped toilets should be built in villages'
p17993
aS'when i had got the first opportunityto address from the ramparts of the red fort i had expressed my feelings about it'
p17994
aS'now i can claim that more than 2 crore toilets have already been built in villages of the country within such a short period'
p17995
aS'more than 70 thousand villages are now free from the practice of open defecation'
p17996
aS'we are working towards bringing change in the lives of common man'
p17997
aS'i had earlier announced from the ramparts of the red fort that we would electrify those 18 thousand villages which are still without electricity'
p17998
aS'we are going to complete 70 years of independence but they had not seen electricity'
p17999
aS'they were forced to live in the 18th century'
p18000
aS'we undertook this task of making possible the impossible and today i am glad to say that though we have not been able to complete even half the task within a thousand days we are still away from thehalf-mark out of the 18 thousand electricity has reached ten thousand villages'
p18001
aS'i have been told that there are many among those villages who are watching independence day celebrations for the first time today on television in their homes'
p18002
aS'today from here i extend special greetings to those villages'
p18003
aS'brothers and sisters you will be surprised to know that at merely three hours journey from delhi there is a village called nagla fatela in hathras region'
p18004
aS'it takes only three hours to reach this nagla fatela'
p18005
aS'but it took 70 years for electricity to reach there'
p18006
aS'70 years my brothers and sisters'
p18007
aS'and therefore i am introducing you to the work culture that we are following'
p18008
aS'brothers and sisters the led bulbs were developed by the science and the researchers for welfare of every citizen'
p18009
aS'but in india it used to cost 350 rupees'
p18010
aS'who would buy it'
p18011
aS'and even the government would think its alright'
p18012
aS'the work is done'
p18013
aS'someone must be using it'
p18014
aS'but this should not be the attitude'
p18015
aS'if led bulbs can bring about a change in the life of a common man if it can ameliorate the environment if it can improve indias economy then the government must make effortsin this direction'
p18016
aS'it is the nature of the government that it intervenes where it is not required and shies away from intervening where it is needed'
p18017
aS'we tried to change this situation this work culture'
p18018
aS'and therefore the bulb which used to be sold at 350 rupees it is now being sold at 50 rupees because of governmental intervention'
p18019
aS'see the difference'
p18020
aS'350 rupees on one hand and 50 rupees on the other'
p18021
aS'i do not want to ask where all this money used to go however thirteen crorebulbs have been distributed till date'
p18022
aS'the politics of our country has become populist the economic policies have become populist'
p18023
aS'if three hundred rupees subsidy for each bulb had been given from public exchequer the prime minister would have been applauded for doling out five hundred crore to the people'
p18024
aS'but we have ensured that they save thousands of crores by providing bulbs at only fifty rupees'
p18025
aS'we have already distributed thirteen crore bulbs and we have resolved to distribute 77 crores and i would like to appeal tomy countrymen to use led bulbs in their homes and save 200 300 500 rupees in a year and save energy and save our environment'
p18026
aS'the day we achieve the target of 77 crore bulbs we would be saving 20 thousand mega watt of electricity'
p18027
aS'when we save 20000 megawatt electricity it means we save around 125000 crores rupees'
p18028
aS'brothers and sisters you can save 125000 crore rupees of the country by using a led bulb at your home'
p18029
aS'we can fight against global warming by saving 20000megawatt electricity and contribute a lot towards the efforts aimed at the protection of environment and a common man can also contribute to it'
p18030
aS'so brothers and sisters we have worked in that direction-making the impossible possible'
p18031
aS'you know that we depend on other countries of the world for energy and petroleum products and for that we have signed long term agreements with them so that we could get these products at fixed prices for a long period'
p18032
aS'we have entered into an agreement with quatar for buying gas till 2024 but the prices are so high that it is costly for our economy'
p18033
aS'it was a result of our foreign policy relationship that we were able to renegotiate with quatar and the agreement which was the rightof quatar and we were bound to buy gas from it till 2024 we negotiated with them and today i can say with satisfaction that we made an impossible task possible they renegotiated their prices and it will save 2000 crore rupees of the exchequer of india'
p18034
aS'they were entitled to get these 20000 crore rupees but the nature of relationship that we have with them and our policies have made it possible'
p18035
aS'the negotiations have been going on during the tenure of all the governments and effortswere also made for chabahar port which is an important link for connecting us with central asia but today i feel satisfied to see an impossible task becoming possible'
p18036
aS'when iran afganistan and india collectively march ahead in a planned way for the construction of chabahar port an impossible task becomes possible'
p18037
aS'my brothers and sisters one thing i want to talk about and which concerns the common man is inflation'
p18038
aS'it is true that the inflation rate had crossed 10 mark during the tenure of previous government'
p18039
aS'due to our sustained efforts we were able to keep it below 6 percent'
p18040
aS'not only this we have recently made an agreement with the reserve bank of india that the rbi should take steps to control the inflation at the level of 4 percent with allowance of plus minus 2'
p18041
aS'we should leavebehind the talks of balance between inflation and growth and work for moving ahead'
p18042
aS'but the country witnessed drought during last two years and the effect of drought are readily seen on the prices of vegetables and the outcomes of sluggishness of market have resulted in some problems'
p18043
aS'the decline in the production of pulses due to drought during last two years was also a cause of concern'
p18044
aS'but brothers and sisters if the inflation would have increased at the same pace as it hadpreviously increased i dont know how the poor of my country would have survived'
p18045
aS'we have tried our best to keep it under check but still people have lot of expectations from this government and dear countrymen your expectations are natural and i will not leave no stone unturned in achieving them'
p18046
aS'whatever best i can do i shall do that and keep the price of poor mans meal under check'
p18047
aS'my dear brothers and sisters country is going to celebrate the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji'
p18048
aS'how can the country forget the saga of sacrifice which has been the tradition of sikh gurus'
p18049
aS'today when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji i recall one best thought expressed by guruji'
p18050
aS'guru gobind singhji use to say how can i consider those hands pure which have not done any service hands which have not strengthened by labour and have notdeveloped any blisters by toiling hard'
p18051
aS'guru gobind singhji use to say this'
p18052
aS'today when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji i remember our farmers'
p18053
aS'whose hands are more pure than theirs'
p18054
aS'whose hearts are more pious than their'
p18055
aS'whose intentions can be more pure than theirs'
p18056
aS'i thanks our farmers that despite two years of drought they consistently endeavored to fill our granaries i greet them for this'
p18057
aS'drought situation has changed and this time we arewitnessing good monsoon'
p18058
aS'heavy rains have also created problems at some places'
p18059
aS'government of india stood with those states and citizen who suffered due to heavy rains'
p18060
aS'today i specially want to thank our farmers because when we are facing shortage of pulses and our farmers have shifted to other crops and rise in demand of pulses by common man i have to say this with content that this time our farmers have increased the sowing by one and half times'
p18061
aS'i want to thank our farmersbecause they have come forward to solve the problem of the crisis of pulses and find its solution'
p18062
aS'we have decided the msp for pulses and declared a bonus on it'
p18063
aS'we have streamlined the process of purchase of pulses and promoting the farmers for cultivation of pulses'
p18064
aS'this will benefit us in a big way'
p18065
aS'brothers and sisters when i was talking about work culture one thing was clear that i do not look at the issues in isolation but as a whole'
p18066
aS'let us see it as integrated and just take agriculture under integrated things we have developed such work culture with lot of hard work the complete chain of which can produce a great result'
p18067
aS'first of all we focussed upon- the wellness of this soil wellness of this land soil health card macro-nutrition concern for micro-nutrition and madethe farmers understand that this is lacuna in your soil these are the good qualities your soil is good for this crop this is not suitable for this crop and gradually the farmers started their planning according to this soil health card'
p18068
aS'the people who have planned tell me sir our expenditure has been reduced up to 25 percent and 30 percent increase is being visible n our production'
p18069
aS'this number is less at present but in future as soon as this may pass on this concept willgain momentum'
p18070
aS'the farmers have land and if they get water then the farmer of my country has the power to produce gold out of the soil'
p18071
aS'the famer of my country has this power and that is why we have emphasized upon water-management emphasized upon water-irrigation emphasized upon water-conservation'
p18072
aS'we are emphasizing upon how every drop of water may be utilised by the farmer how to increase the importance of water and get per drop more crop micro irrigation'
p18073
aS'more than 90percent irrigation projects were lying incomplete and stalled'
p18074
aS'we have taken up the responsibility to complete those projects first of all and will work in the direction that lakh of hectares of land may get the benefit of irrigation'
p18075
aS'we have taken a big leap towards solar pump so that the input cost of the farmers may be lessened because nowadays the farmers require electricity also they require water they need electricity and electricity costs dearer'
p18076
aS'on account of it theinput cost of the farmer is going to be less the recurring expenditure is going to be less and due to owning solar pump at home will result in owning electricity owning the sun owning the field owing the barn and thus our farmer would be happy'
p18077
aS'we have succeeded in distributing 77 thousands solar pumps till now'
p18078
aS'brothers and sisters i would like to congratulate the scientists of our country'
p18079
aS'good quality seeds are also required along with soil water and solar pumps'
p18080
aS'the scientists of our country have developed more than 131 new farmable seeds compatible to the climate and nature of india which have the capacity to enhance our per hectare production'
p18081
aS'the values they retain are also being increased'
p18082
aS'i heartly congratulate these scientists also'
p18083
aS'the farmers require urea as well asfertilisers'
p18084
aS'there was time when black marketing was in practice to get the fertilisers there was time when the police had to lathi-charge for fertilisers'
p18085
aS'there was time when the farmer used to watch his crop being damaged in the absence of fertilisers before his very eyes'
p18086
aS'brothers and sisters the lack of fertilisers has become a matter of past it has become history now'
p18087
aS'today we have succeeded in utmost production of fertiliser by overcoming the shortage of thefertiliser'
p18088
aS'brothers and sisters because of this production the fertilizers are now available to the farmers in time as per their needs'
p18089
aS'similarly we conceptualized pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana'

p18091
aS'we have constructed new warehouses to preserve 15 lakhs tons of food grains'

aS'our countrys farmers will benefit only when we movetowards value addition and for this we have laid special emphasis on food processing for the first time'
p18093
aS'we have encouraged cent percent foreign direct investment which would augment agro-based industries and consequentially my brothers and sisters i believe it would help me and our farmers realize our dream of doubling latters income by 2022'
p18094
aS'these efforts would make it possible and for realizing the same we have taken steps one after another'
p18095
aS'brothers and sisters our country has a fancy for a trend'
p18096
aS'and the governments with an aim to leave an impression have done a lot and to fill the bill in this country people go for some populist things and empty the exchequer'
p18097
aS'governments have a trend of establishing an identity'
p18098
aS'brothers and sisters i have tried my best to stay away from this allurement and while doing so i have tried to do several things in every range with the mantra of total transformation transformationwith transparency reform perform and transform'
p18099
aS'brothers and sisters we are far more committed to build the image of hindustan than that of our government'
p18100
aS'regardless of partys identity the countrys identity holds primacy'
p18101
aS'for if the country moves on it will yield dividends for the coming generations for centuries and exactly for this reason we have accorded primacy to the countrys identity and not to our party'
p18102
aS'now a days you must have observed the scope of our work in railways'
p18103
aS'while we are talking about havingbio-toilets in train we also cherish the dream of bullet train'
p18104
aS'while we talk about soil health card for farmers we also want to march ahead in the direction of satellite and space technology'
p18105
aS'while talking about stand-up india we are also taking steps towards start-up india'
p18106
aS'we are laying emphasis on substance than on symbolism'
p18107
aS'we are stressing on integrated development than on isolated development'
p18108
aS'leaving aside entitlement we are focused and emphatic on empowermentbecause an empowering country my brothers and sisters provides an identity to the government through the prism of the newly declared schemes'
p18109
aS'but sometimes the old schemes just tumble down'
p18110
aS'nevertheless the govts'
p18111
aS'is a continuity'
p18112
aS'if the earlier govts'
p18113
aS'have done some work then it is in the national interest that the next government rectifies their shortcomings and gives a go ahead to these schemes'
p18114
aS'the arrogance that this was the work of your government and this is mygovt hence we would not do this work is not in the fitness of the things in a democracy'
p18115
aS'this is why with all humility we have given similar importance to the schemes of the previous governments'
p18116
aS'this is the hallmark of our work culture as our nation is a continuous and a ceaseless system and we wish to retain that system'
p18117
aS'this is why i have a project called progress'
p18118
aS'under this project every month i myself sit and review all the on going projects'
p18119
aS'you would be amazedto know that almost 119 projects worth rs'
p18120
aS'seven and a half lakh crores'
p18121
aS'started by various previous govts'
p18122
aS'were lying pending'
p18123
aS'i got all of them going'
p18124
aS'i said so much of money have been spent on them so all these projects should be completed'
p18125
aS'now they are all on the way to completion'
p18126
aS'we created a project monitoring group'
p18127
aS'i asked them to look into all such projects and find out as to when were they started'
p18128
aS'i came to know that some of them were started 20 years ago theother were started somewhere between twenty five to thirty to fifteen years earlier'
p18129
aS'the people living in the areas of these projects know all'
p18130
aS'we identified such two hundred and seventy projects worth rs'
p18131
aS'10 lakhs crores which were inaugurated by some earlier govts'
p18132
aS'and some crores of rupees were spent on all of them but all that money was going down the drain'
p18133
aS'we started all such stuck up projects once again'
p18134
aS'brothers and sisters such helding up and delaying of the schemes afterhaving spent crores of rupees on them is a criminal negligence and we have tried to tide over such things'
p18135
aS'brothers and sisters earlier railway projects took at least two years in getting sanctions'

aS'a train is passing from somewhere road have also been made on the both side a rail over bridge is to be constructed'
p18137
aS'but the approval took two years'
p18138
aS'we have speeded up the approval process and have been able to shorten the approval time to three or four months or maximum to six months'
p18139
aS'brothers and sisters however fast we may work whatsoever may be the number of the schemes started by us the touchstone of good administration of any government lies in the last man delivery or the benefits accrued to that person'
p18140
aS'so this has to be taken care off'
p18141
aS'brothers and sisters when policies are clear intentions are clear then the sentiments behind the decisions are also a class part and the decisions can be taken unhesitantly'
p18142
aS'so due to the correct policies and thecorrect intentions our government is taking unhesitant decisions and giving emphasis on the last man delivery'
p18143
aS'we have seen and if you also go through the newspapers of uttar pradesh every year there were stories about the outstanding balance of sugar cane farmers'
p18144
aS'every year there was news that this is not being done by the sugar mill owners that was not being done by the state govt that sugar cane farmers are in distress'
p18145
aS'thousands of crores of the rupees was outstanding'
p18146
aS'so we made schemes in this regard and tired to ensure the last man delivery and also ensured that the amountshould reach to the farmers'
p18147
aS'brothers and sisters out of the total old outstanding balance of the thousands of crores of rupees i would like to inform you with a lot of satisfaction that almost 99'
p18148

p18153
aS'a target has been laid down to provide gas connections to 5 crores poor families within 3 years'
p18154
aS'efforts are in progress and we have already provided gas connections to around 50 lakhs and that also have been done merely within the last hundred days -you can imagine - that it may be possible to achieve the said target even before three years'
p18155
aS'we intend to emphasis upon last mile delivery in this mission'
p18156
aS'post has steadily become irrelevant due to onlining of our post offices information technology whatsapp messages e-mail'
p18157
aS'our country is known as the chains of post offices and we have revamped these post offices'
p18158
aS'post offices are linked with poor and marginalised people'
p18159
aS'postman is the only representative of the government who is linked with the feelings and affections of the common man'
p18160
aS'we have never safeguarded the interests of the post man who has always got the affectionsof everyone and the postman always cares for common people'
p18161
aS'we have taken measures to convert our post office into a payment bank'

p18168
aS'we have strived to launch a new work-culture'
p18169
aS'today i can point out in satisfaction that we have succeeded to turn the operation of so called notorious air india into an operational profit-making undertaking during the last year'
p18170
aS'it is a fact that which all the telcom companies ofthe world are profit-making units the bsnl was turning into a heavy loss-making undertaking'
p18171
aS'we have succeeded in bringing bsnl to operational profit for the first time'
p18172
aS'nobody believed that the shipping corporation of india could also rake in profit now it is bringing profit'
p18173
aS'there was a time when it was apprehended that how would a power factory last for a week'
p18174
aS'whether we would be able to get coal for them or not'
p18175
aS'it also used to be reported that power factories have been shut downfor want of coal'

p18181
aS'we have linked aadhar card and aadhar number with the government policies'

aS'dear brothers sisters earlier there was a system under which funds used to be released from public exchequer for widow pension scholarship persons with disabilities and minorities and also we used to receive list of beneficiaries'
p18183
aS'we looked into it deeply and found that even unborn children are also listed in it and getting benefit out of such schemes'
p18184
aS'these middlemen used to siphon off billions of rupees from it and nobody even took notice of it'
p18185
aS'but under the aadhar system we have removed all these middlemen from the list of beneficiaries and directly transferred the amount to the beneficiaries and found that these are millions of such ghost beneficiaries who do not exist at all and used to receive billions of rupees from it'
p18186
aS'now that has been checked'
p18187
aS'we saved lot of amount'
p18188
aS'we decided to find out the needy persons who were excluded from that list so that the amount of money saved from it should invariably be deposited into the accounts of those persons who want to fight for their rights'
p18189
aS'we have worked in that direction to deliver it to the last man delivery and we have made it to reach it to them'

aS'we invited netajis family members and shown them the files and this process of declassifying will continue'

p18357
aS'we know how to respect we know hospitality we know how to assimilate we have carried this great tradition and that is why there is no room for violence and atrocity in our country'
p18358
aS'if the democracy of india is to be strengthened the dreams of india are to befulfilled then the path of violence would never bring success for us'
p18359
aS'nowadays a game of killing the innocents is being played on the pretext of maoism in forests on the pretext of extremism at border on the pretext of terrorism at hilly areas by carrying guns on shoulders'

p18375
aS'brothers and sisters what kind of people are those who got drive from humanity and what is the kind of those who reward terrorism'

p18383
aS'where innocent people are killed in terrorist attack and they celebrate what type of terrorism inspired life it is what type of these creations of the terrorism inspired governments are'
p18384
aS'the world will understand these two differences properly this is sufficient for me'
p18385

p18389
aS'the freedom fighters who earlier used to get 25000 rupees will now get 30000 rupees'
p18390
aS'it is mysmall effort to pay my respects to the sacrifice and oblation of our freedom fighters'
p18391
aS'brothers and sisters when we talk about the history of freedom struggle of our country some persons are talked about a lot some are excessively mentioned but the contribution made by the people living in jungles the tribals in the freedom struggle was unmatched'
p18392
aS'they used to live in jungles'
p18393
aS'we hear the name of birsa munda but perhaps there would be no tribal dominated district where the tribals would not have fought and given sacrifice since 1857 to the time we got freedom'
p18394
aS'theyproved through their sacrifice what is freedom what is struggle against servitude'
p18395
aS'but our forthcoming generations are not much aware of this history'
p18396
aS'the government desires and plans that in the coming days in the states where these freedom fighters who were tribals who lived in jungles fought against britishers who were not ready to succumb'

aS'you and i have been fortunate to have done so on important occasions in the past months'
p18429
aS'in december last year you and the afghan people stood with me to inaugurate the afghan parliament'
p18430
aS'the inauguration signaled and showed our joint commitment to strengthening the foundations of modern afghanistan'
p18431
aS'the india-afghanistan-iran transit corridor agreement that we signed in may this year was another land mark in our partnership'
p18432
aS'it manifested our clear and common determination to build new pathways for afghanistans economic progress and prosperity and a month later in june this year we joined hands and inaugurated the afghanistan-india friendship dam'
p18433
aS'the salma dam will revive and renew not just the economy and agriculture of the herat region of afghanistan'

aS'excellency todays video inauguration of stor palace is an entirely different yet in many ways more fundamental dimension of our engagement'
p18436
aS'i say this because it brings back to life a valuable landmark of afghanistans cultural heritage'
p18437
aS'the stor palace has been the setting for many momentous historical events'
p18438
aS'to those who can not see beyond shadows of violence in afghanistan the restored stor palace is a reminder of the glory of afghanistans rich traditions'
p18439
aS'and for our afghan brothers and sisters it revives the beauty the richness and splendor of lost memories of afghan society'
p18440
aS'true to the foundations of our ties it links the present of our friendship to the historical bonds of our linkages'
p18441
aS'i must commend all the artists experts and consultants who worked day and night to accomplish this delicate task'

aS'friends afghanistan is a close friend'
p18443
aS'our societies and people have had age old ties and links'

aS'i look forward to seeing you in person soon'
p18455
aS'i also hope to have an opportunity to visit the renovated stor palace someday'
p18456
aS'thank you thank you very much'
p18457
aS'there was a time when development was believed to depend on the quantity of capital and labour'
p18458
aS'today we know that it depends as much on the quality of institutions and ideas'
p18459
aS'early last year a new institution was created namely the national institution for transforming india or niti'
p18460
aS'niti was created as an evidence based think tank to guide indias transformation'
p18461
aS'one of nitis functions is - to mainstream external ideas into government policies through collaboration with national and international experts - to be the governments link to the outside world outside experts and practitioners - to be the instrument through which ideas from outside are incorporated into policy-making'
p18462
aS'the government of india and the state governments have a long administrative tradition'
p18463
aS'this tradition combines indigenous and external ideas from indias past'
p18464
aS'this administrative tradition has served india well in many ways'
p18465
aS'above all it has preserved democracy and federalism unity and integrity in a country of glorious diversity'
p18466
aS'these are not small achievements'
p18467
aS'yet we now live in an age where change is constant and we are variables'
p18468
aS'we must change for both external and internal reasons'
p18469
aS'each country has its own experiences its own resources and its own strengths'
p18470
aS'thirty years ago a country might have been able to look inward and find its own solutions'
p18471
aS'today countries are inter dependent and inter connected'
p18472
aS'no country can afford any longer to develop in isolation'
p18473
aS'every country has to benchmark its activities to global standards or else fall behind'
p18474
aS'change is also necessary for internal reasons'
p18475
aS'the younger generation in our own country is thinking and aspiring so differently that government can no longer afford to remain rooted in the past'
p18476
aS'even in families the relationship between the young and old has changed'
p18477
aS'there was a time when elders in a family knew more than those who were younger'
p18478
aS'today with the spread of new technology the situation is often reversed'
p18479
aS'this increases the challenge for government in communicating and in meeting rising expectations'
p18480
aS'if india is to meet the challenge of change mere incremental progress is not enough'
p18481
aS'a metamorphosis is needed'
p18482
aS'that is why my vision for india is rapid transformation not gradual evolution'
p18483
aS'- the transformation of india can not happen without a transformation of governance'
p18484
aS'- a transformation of governance can not happen without a transformation in mindset'
p18485
aS'- a transformation in mindset can not happen without transformative ideas'
p18486
aS'we have to change laws eliminate unnecessary procedures speed up processes and adopt technology'
p18487
aS'we can not march through the twenty first century with the administrative systems of the nineteenth century'
p18488
aS'fundamental changes in administrative mindsets usually occur through sudden shocks or crisis'
p18489
aS'india is fortunate to be a stable democratic polity'
p18490
aS'in the absence of such shocks we have to make special efforts to force ourselves to make transformative changes'
p18491
aS'as individuals we may absorb new ideas by reading books or articles'
p18492
aS'books open the windows of our minds'
p18493
aS'however unless we brainstorm collectively ideas remain confined to individual minds'
p18494
aS'we often hear of new ideas and understand them'
p18495
aS'but we do not act upon them because it is beyond our individual capacity'
p18496
aS'if we sit together we will have the collective force to convert ideas into action'
p18497
aS'what we need is a collective opening of our minds to let in new global perspectives'
p18498
aS'to do this we have to absorb new ideas collectively rather than individually'
p18499
aS'it requires a concerted effort'
p18500
aS'as many of you know ever since taking office i have personally participated in structured brainstorming sessions with bankers with police officers and with secretaries to government among others'
p18501
aS'the ideas coming from those sessions are being incorporated into policy'
p18502
aS'these efforts have been to tap ideas from inside'
p18503
aS'the next step is to bring in ideas from outside'
p18504
aS'culturally indians have always been receptive to ideas from elsewhere'
p18505
aS'it is said in the rigveda which means let us welcome noble thoughts flowing in from all directions'
p18506
aS'this is the purpose of the transforming india lecture series'
p18507
aS'it is a series which we will attend not as individuals but as part of a team who can collectively make change happen'
p18508
aS'we will draw the best from the wisdom and knowledge of eminent persons who changed or influenced change in the lives of many to make their nation a better place in the planet'
p18509
aS'this lecture will be the first in a series'
p18510
aS'you have all been given a feedback form'
p18511
aS'i look forward to your detailed and frank feedback to help us improve this process'
p18512
aS'i request you to suggest names of experts and panelists from inside and outside india'
p18513
aS'i also request all secretaries to government to conduct a follow up discussion in a weeks time with the participants from their ministries'
p18514
aS'the purpose is to convert ideas that emerge in todays session into specific actionpoints relevant to each group'
p18515
aS'wherever possible i request the ministers also to participate in these sessions'
p18516
aS'one of the greatest reformers and administrators of our time was lee kuan yew who transformed singapore to what it is today'
p18517
aS'it is therefore fitting that we are inaugurating this series with shri tharman shanmugaratnam deputy prime minister of singapore'
p18518
aS'he is a prolific scholar and public policy maker'
p18519
aS'apart from being deputy prime minister he is also the coordinating minister for economic and social policies minister of finance and chairman of monetary authority ofsingapore'
p18520

p18524
aS'he has another masters degree in public administration from harvard university'
p18525
aS'at harvard he was honoured with the littauer fellow award for his outstanding performance'
p18526
aS'shri shanmugaratnam is one of the worlds leading intellectuals'
p18527
aS'i would like to give you an example of the range and sweep of his ideas'
p18528
aS'today singapores economy depends a lot on transshipment'
p18529
aS'but if global warming melts the polar ice caps new navigation routes may open and possibly reduce singapores relevance'
p18530
aS'i am told he has already started thinking about this possibility and planning for it'
p18531
aS'friends'
p18532
aS'the list of achievements and honours received by shri shanmugaratnam is long'
p18533
aS'but we are all eager to listen to him'
p18534
aS'therefore without further delay it is with great pleasure that i welcome shri tharman shanmugaratnam to this stage and request him to enlighten us on the subject of india in the global economy'
