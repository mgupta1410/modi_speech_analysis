a(lp587
S'my greetings to all my beloved fellow countrymen who have dedicated their lives protecting our great country india !'
p588
aS'i have come out of delhi for the first time as a prime minister and have come directly to you .'
p589
aS'i believe this will help you understand the priorities of the new government .'
p590
aS'to ensure that our country supersedes the new heights set for development , to ensure that the poorest of the poor live with happiness and peace and the single most important pre-condition is that india should be safe .'
p591
aS'and for this safety the biggest driving force are the armed forces be it the army , the navy or the air force .'
p592
aS'it is the ability , sacrifice and dedication of our soldiers that ensures a peaceful sleep to the 125 crore indians .'
p593
aS'in todays scenario , the armed forces have undergone sea change .'
p594
aS'modern technology has become an important component in the field of security .'
p595
aS'hence for a nation to be equipped with the most advanced defence technologies and armaments is as important as the pooling up of dedicated , talented and courageous souls in its armed forces .'
p596
aS'today is an important day in the history of indias security and through our navy that this golden chapter is being added to it .'
p597
aS'vikramaditya is being dedicated to the soldiers of the navy .'
p598
aS'a new and important step is getting imprinted in indias security .'
p599
aS'the common man of the country would not be able to comprehend the importance of vikramaditya as this is not his domain but to those soldiers of the navy , who have decided to dedicate their lives for the mother india , very well know and understand the potential of vikramaditya .'
p600
aS'it is a matter of great pride and happiness for me that i have the opportunity of being amongst you in this historical moment when vikramaditya is being inducted to the fleet , to be able to understand its potential and strength and also to take pride in indias valour .'
p601
aS'the navy has won accolades in many fields .'
p602
aS'in the entire history of mankind , shivaji was the first person to float the concept of a naval force and its basic association was less with war .'
p603
aS'its main aim was to protect the ships going for international trade and it was shivajis dream that india should become a powerful country in world trade .'
p604
aS'hence he thought of protecting the individuals involved in trade and with this the concept of a naval force came into existence centuries ago .'
p605
aS'today , naval forces have become very important for all those countries having long coastlines or who are close to the sea .'
p606
aS'the competition in modern science and technology has also become equally important .'
p607
aS'the navy has adopted the methodology of indigenous technology , the scientists from our very own india in conjunction with the inputs from navy slowly developed indigenous technology and has entered in the field of strategic warfare and in the very near future we plan to take it forward .'
p608
aS'we have to come out of the situation very soon when a country like india still imports defence equipments even after so many years of independence .'
p609
aS'india has to move forward in the field of self-sufficiency in defence offset production and india should become a hub of such equipment for smaller nations of the world .'
p610
aS'the smaller nations should have faith that they have reliable defence equipment made in india by the indian youth .'
p611
aS'we should move forward with the dream that smaller nations should be inculcated the faith that they will never accept defeat .'
p612
aS'the talent , innovation , research , technological upgradation capabilities of the indian youth coupled with our strong deterrence will make us an unbeatable power and no one will dare to undermine us .'
p613
aS'the safety of the nation is associated not only with the soldiers of all the three forces but also with the temperament of the people in power .'
p614
aS'india neither wants to undermine any countrys sovereignty nor are we going to live with heads bowed down .'
p615
aS'we may be a very strong nation , but we do not intend to threaten anyone , rather we wish to move together .'
p616
aS'at the same time we are not ready to bow down and the indian government has the capability to see anyone in the eye and make its point .'
p617
aS'and at the root cause of this courage is the preparation and courage of our soldiers and that gives us this strength .'
p618
aS'today , i had the chance to see this huge development meant for our defence forces .'
p619
aS'for hours , i have been looking at this ship from every angle - from top to bottom and from right to left .'
p620
aS'i have been told that more than 1600 soldiers have been deployed on it simultaneously .'
p621
aS'our air fleet will be able to take off and land from this ship .'
p622
aS'this is an important development from strategic point of view and today we have received an important gift .'
p623
aS'i offer my heartiest wishes to all the naval officers of the country .'
p624
aS'the preparation required on the coast is much more than the readiness required in the sea .'
p625
aS'training of the citizens there is equally important for the help of the navy .'
p626
aS'a network of naval ncc needs to be created in the coastal areas .'
p627
aS'through the medium of naval ncc , patriotic youth force can emerge as a powerful tool which can provide the navy with critical information and help from behind the scenes and we want to work in this direction in the near future .'
p628
aS'i would again like to give my good wishes to the soldiers of the army , navy and air force on this pious occasion today .'
p629
aS'this new government has made some important decisions .'
p630
aS'for many years the soldiers have had a wish .'
p631
aS'i do not know why that task was not undertaken by the previous governments .'
p632
aS'may be it is my destined good fortune to do this good and holy task .'
p633
aS'and so this government has decided to create a national level war memorial .'
p634
aS'the future generations may be reminded of those who in the post independence era laid down their lives for the country , which is why we have decided to take this step .'
p635
aS'one rank one pension has been a long battle , it has witnessed many ups and downs , many promises were made but the intention was never evident .'
p636
aS'this government just does not make promises , it has the intention to implement it too .'
p637
aS'we are committed to implement one rank one pension scheme .'
p638
aS'i again dedicate the vikramaditya to the navy , which has sun like brightness in its name that inspires to win many a wars ahead .'
p639
aS'i wish that your life may be filled with the same brightness , valor and the conviction to be always victorious .'
p640
aS'join me in saying , bharat mata ki jai !'
p641
aS'bharat mata ki jai !'
p642
aS'bharat mata ki jai !'
p643
aa(lp644
S'the global economic environment remains uncertain and challenging .'
p645
aS'recovery is still fragile despite improved prospects .'
p646
aS'in an environment of political conflict and persisting weakness in major economies ; we have to be watchful for signs of a new bout of financial turmoil .'
p647
aS'developments in iraq and the wider region could affect this .'
p648
aS'i am also concerned that tight monetary policies in some countries couldundercut investment and growth in ours .'
p649
aS'an open , rule-based , international trading regime is critical for global economic growth .'
p650
aS'it must address the aspirations of the developing world .'
p651
aS'it must also accommodate the special needs of the most vulnerable sections of our societies , especially in areas such as food security .'
p652
aS'this is our broad expectation from the negotiations in the doha round of wto .'
p653
aS'excellencies , the agreement towards setting up the brics new development bank is a significant step .'
p654
aS'i am happy , the initiative announced at the brics summit in new delhi in 2012 , has become a reality .'
p655
aS'the agreement on the brics contingent reserve arrangement is another major achievement .'
p656
aS'i compliment our finance ministers for concluding these two initiatives so quickly .'
p657
aS'these initiatives are rooted in our own experience as developing countries .'
p658
aS'they show our capacity to set up global institutions .'
p659
aS'they will open new avenues for supporting development in our countries as well as helping other developing nations .'
p660
aS'we should ensure these institutions establish a new model for supporting growth and stability .'
p661
aS'excellencies , the theme of this summit is also the guiding principle of my government .'
p662
aS'for us , inclusion is a special challenge and responsibility ; given our vast social , regional and economic diversity .'
p663
aS'our policies will focus on empowering people with skills and opportunities .'
p664
aS'we will invest heavily in infrastructure , affordable housing , healthcare , education and clean energy .'
p665
aS'we will harness all possibilities that advanced technologies open up .'
p666
aS'all this will require fast-tracking of growth .'
p667
aS'we will champion , clean and frugal resource use ; to maintain the sustainabilityof our development process , without constraining our growth .'
p668
aS'sustainability has in fact been a core element of the indian way of life .'
p669
aS'as mahatma gandhi had said , the world has enough , for everyones need , but not for everyones greed .'
p670
aS'we can all partake of the bounty of nature .'
p671
aS'however , exploitation of nature is a crime .'
p672
aS'we have made progress , on the millennium development goals .'
p673
aS'but widespread poverty still haunts us .'
p674
aS'we must keep poverty eradication at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda .'
p675
aS'it is important to shape the global discourse on the same , especially in forums like the un .'
p676
aS'brics can be a major voice on the world stage to build consensus towards such efforts .'
p677
aS'excellencies , brics is in a position today where it wields enough horizontal influence to compel the world to take notice .'
p678
aS'our own good , however , lies in deepening our bonds vertically .'
p679
aS'we must focus on further decentralizing , this powerful forum .'
p680
aS'we must go beyond summit and leader-centric deliberations ; and champion sub-national level exchanges .'
p681
aS'we must encourage engagement between our states , cities and other local bodies .'
p682
aS'brics should in fact be truly driven by people to people contact .'
p683
aS'our youth , in particular , must take a lead in this .'
p684
aS'popularizing our languages through dedicated brics language schoolsin all brics countries could be a beginning in this direction .'
p685
aS'we could also consider establishing massive open online courses for making quality education accessible to all .'
p686
aS'we could even explore the idea of a brics university .'
p687
aS'today , technology is a transformative toolin every area of social and economic development .'
p688
aS'the vast pool of talent in brics could be combined to cooperate in areas like : health , education , agriculture , resource management and urban development .'
p689
aS'perhaps a young scientists forum of brics countries could be explored .'
p690
aS'other initiatives could include : an affordable healthcare platform of brics nations .'
p691
aS'mechanism to further cooperation , between our small and medium enterprises .'
p692
aS'and , a common framework for promoting tourism among brics countries .'
p693
aS'i am aware of the comprehensive proposals that our chinese and russian partners have put forward to deepen brics cooperation .'
p694
aS'our sherpas should examine them urgently .'
p695
aS'let us deepen our bonds to make brics a stronger instrument of progress , for all mankind .'
p696
aa(lp697
S'excellencies , distinguished members of the business council ladies and gentlemen , i believe , economic forces are becoming increasingly important in global relationships .'
p698
aS'domains like trade , technology , tourism , talent and tradition have the power to redefine existing paradigms .'
p699
aS'i am thus pleased , that we established , the brics business council , in durban , last year .'
p700
aS'it is important , that our business leaders lead the effort in promoting trade , investment and manufacturing ties , among our countries .'
p701
aS'i appreciate the work done by the council .'
p702
aS'various enabling agreements , and mous ; have already been signed between brics development banks , to promote intra-brics trade and investment .'
p703
aS'i would suggest the business council work in close coordination with the development banks , and , the contact group on trade and investment issues .'
p704
aS'the suggestions presented in the annual report are important .'
p705
aS'the council should work closely with brics sherpas to see how these suggestions can be taken forward .'
p706
aS'i am also happy to note that the council has gone beyond brics to make concrete proposals for contributing to the growth , and development of the larger african region .'
p707
aS'india remains committed to partnering with african countries in their developmental initiatives .'
p708
aS'i once again , express my appreciation for the good work that has been done .'
p709
aa(lp710
S'your excellency , president dilma rousseff your excellency , president vladimir putin your excellency , president xi jinping your excellency , president jacob zuma distinguished delegates , ladies , and gentlemen i am delighted to be in brazil .'
p711
aS'i thank president rousseff , the government , and the wonderful people of brazil for their hospitality .'
p712
aS'this is my first brics summit and it has been a truly enriching experience .'
p713
aS'i have gained a lot from the insight and vision of the world leaders gathered here .'
p714
aS'i have also had the privilege of sowing the seeds of personal relationships with each of the leaders .'
p715
aS'i look forward to seeing them blossom into deep and strong personal bonds in the days to come .'
p716
aS'excellencies , brics enters the second cycle of its summits today .'
p717
aS'this summit takes place at a crucial juncture .'
p718
aS'the world is facing a high level of economic and political turmoil .'
p719
aS'conflict and instability is growing in many key regions .'
p720
aS'this increases the challenges of tackling poverty , making growth more inclusive , and evolving a sustainable model of development .'
p721
aS'restoring a climate of peace and stability is an urgent global need .'
p722
aS'this calls for newer avenues of cooperation and collaboration .'
p723
aS'i believe brics can answer this call .'
p724
aS'this i do because of the uniqueness of brics as an international institution .'
p725
aS'for the first time it brings together a group of nations on the parameter of future potential ; rather than existing prosperity or shared identities .'
p726
aS'the very idea of brics is thus forward-looking .'
p727
aS'i therefore believe it can add fresh perspectives and mechanisms , to existing international institutions .'
p728
aS'thus , we must ensure that the future development of our partnerships , and institutions , stays true to this original idea .'
p729
aS'brics must provide a united and clear voice in shaping a peaceful , balanced and stable world .'
p730
aS'we should intensify our cooperation in confronting global challenges ; like terrorism , cyber security and climate change .'
p731
aS'brics must also play a proactive role in shaping the global discourse on growth and development .'
p732
aS'this includes shaping the post-2015 development agenda to keep the central focus on tackling poverty .'
p733
aS'we must seek urgent reforms of global institutions of governance like the un security council and international financial institutions .'
p734
aS'we must help shape the wto regime .'
p735
aS'an open trading regime is critical for strong , balanced and sustainable global economic growth .'
p736
aS'this must address the development aspirations of the developing world .'
p737
aS'it must also accommodate the special needs of the weak especially in areas such as food security .'
p738
aS'excellencies , brics has gained enough horizontal influence to compel the world to take notice .'
p739
aS'our own greater good , however , lies more in deepening our bonds vertically .'
p740
aS'this is why i have spoken on decentralizing this powerful forum in our earlier deliberations .'
p741
aS'we must proactively move beyond being summit-centric .'
p742
aS'we must champion sub-national level exchanges .'
p743
aS'champion engagement between our states , cities and other local bodies .'
p744
aS'brics should in fact , be driven by people to people contact .'
p745
aS'our youth in particular must take a lead in this .'
p746
aS'brics should explore developing innovative mechanisms of youth engagement .'
p747
aS'a possible initiative , could focus on nurturing innovation , by establishing a brics young scientists forum .'
p748
aS'another possibility , could be the setting up of brics language schools ; offering language training in each of our languages .'
p749
aS'we could , also consider establishing , massive open online courses , for making quality education , accessible to all .'
p750
aS'we could also explore setting up a brics university .'
p751
aS'this would connect campuses in each of our countries ; virtually , as well as through intensive student , faculty and research collaboration .'
p752
aS'excellencies , i am convinced that each of us can succeed more by working together more closely .'
p753
aS'we must harness each others strengths , in knowledge , skills and resources .'
p754
aS'we must evolve mechanisms to share our experiences , innovations and technology .'
p755
aS'numerous avenues can be explored , such as : - sharing our experiences on development of affordable and reliable clean energy technologies.'
p756
aS'- harnessing advanced technology , like satellite communication , to make quality health and education more accessible .'
p757
aS'- developing a framework for promoting tourism among brics countries .'
p758
aS'- sharing experiences on disaster management , and - collaboration and competitions in sports excellencies , economic forces are becoming increasingly important in global relationships .'
p759
aS'domains like ; trade , tourism , technology , tradition and talent ; have the power , to redefine existing paradigms .'
p760
aS'each of us in brics brings a unique blend of experience and resources .'
p761
aS'we represent four continents .'
p762
aS'each one of us enjoys comparative advantages and complementary strengths .'
p763
aS'brics should develop mechanisms to harness the same ; for furthering our combined as well as individual good .'
p764
aS'great work has already been done in this domain .'
p765
aS'the vision of a new development bank , at the delhi summit two years ago , has been translated into a reality , in fortaleza .'
p766
aS'it will benefit brics nations .'
p767
aS'but will also support other developing nations .'
p768
aS'and , it will be rooted in our own experiences , as developing countries .'
p769
aS'the brics contingent reserve arrangement gives brics nations a new instrument for safeguarding their economic stability .'
p770
aS'this is an important initiative at a time of high volatility in global financial markets .'
p771
aS'the mou on cooperation between export credit guarantee agencies , and the inter-bank cooperation agreement on innovation are other tangible steps that will spur cooperation among brics countries .'
p772
aS'i believe we have now reached a level where we should be even more ambitious .'
p773
aS'we should focus on more such tangible mechanisms and outcomes .'
p774
aS'make brics a platform of impact .'
p775
aS'excellencies , we have an opportunity , to define the future of not just our countries , but the world at large .'
p776
aS'coming from a land where the idea of vasudhaiva kutumbakam - the whole world being one family - is rooted deep in our ethos ; i take this is as a great responsibility .'
p777
aS'our steps must reinforce the hopes , aspirations and confidence , of the developing world .'
p778
aS'once again , i thank president rousseff and the wonderful people of brazil , for hosting this summit .'
p779
aa(lp780
S'your excellencies , the presidents of brics countries your excellencies , the presidents of south american countries distinguished delegates i thank brazil , for providing this opportunity , to interact with leaders , from south american countries .'
p781
aS'i am grateful , to your excellencies , for sparing your valuable time , to meet us today .'
p782
aS'south america , has tremendous potential .'
p783
aS'it is blessed , with vast resources and talent .'
p784
aS'it can become an important pillar of the global economy .'
p785
aS'in the face of economic uncertainty its growth can be crucial for global prosperity .'
p786
aS'in a globalised and inter-connected world , our destinies are inter-linked .'
p787
aS'we are all bound , by shared aspirations and common challenges .'
p788
aS'we all have a stake in each others success .'
p789
aS'distance is not a barrier to opportunities .'
p790
aS'it also does not , insulate us from challenges in other parts of the world .'
p791
aS'thus , we must all unite : to seek faster growth and newer avenues of generating prosperity .'
p792
aS'to find solutions to the challenge of poverty .'
p793
aS'to preserve our environment , and use our resources well .'
p794
aS'our discussions today should throw up new ideas for partnership between brics and south america .'
p795
aS'brics nations have already started a new chapter in this with the brics new development bank .'
p796
aS'this will open up newer opportunities of cooperation .'
p797
aS'excellencies , india and south america share a deep bond .'
p798
aS'authors and poets , like octavio paz , gabriel garcia marquez and pablo neruda are popular in india .'
p799
aS'similarly , our national poet , rabindranath tagore , is widely loved here .'
p800
aS'south america is also home to a large number of indians , many of whom came centuries ago .'
p801
aS'generations later , they remain a strong bridge of friendship , between our nations .'
p802
aS'prime minister , shri narendra modi meeting the president of the republic of peru , mr ollanta humalaprime minister , shri narendra modi meeting the president of the republic of peru , mr ollanta humalamy own home state of gujarat has many links with south america : ages ago , the gir cow made its way from gujarat , all the way to brazil .'
p803
aS'today gujarat accounts for more than half of indias trade , with this wonderful continent .'
p804
aS'excellencies , as chief minister of gujarat , i also had the privilege , to interact with your ambassadors in delhi .'
p805
aS'prime minister , shri narendra modi meeting the president of co-operative republic of guyana , mr donald ramotari was struck by their warmth , and their keen desire to forge closer relations , between india and south america .'
p806
aS'i assure you that india will work more closely with south america than ever before .'
p807
aS'at the bilateral level , as a brics member , in the g-77 , as well as other international forums .'
p808
aS'excellencies , indias trade with south america , has shown strong growth in recent years .'
p809
aS'prime minister , shri narendra modi meeting the president of the republic of suriname , mr desi boutersethere is a growing presence , of indian investors in south america .'
p810
aS'it is , however , still well below potential .'
p811
aS'from hydrocarbons to pharma , textiles to leather , engineering goods to automobiles ; the range of opportunities is enormous .'
p812
aS'we must utilize , the preferential trade agreement between india and the mercosur trade block , and chile , more effectively .'
p813
aS'we also attach importance , to the south american and caribbean business conclave held every year in india .'
p814
aS'a similar investment conclave , is being organized in october 2014 , in india .'
p815
aS'i ask your excellencies , to encourage your business leaders , to take full advantage of this opportunity .'
p816
aS'i firmly believe , the possibilities of cooperation are limited not by distance but only by our imagination and efforts .'
p817
aS'we have much to learn from each other , in our journey towards inclusive and sustainable development .'
p818
aS'we must share with each other , our experiences , best practices and innovative solutions .'
p819
aS'india stands committed to the same .'
p820
aS'i am pleased , that india has deputed experts , to countries in the south american region in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , disaster management , communications and law .'
p821
aS'we are also working together in renewable energy .'
p822
aS'almost 250 students from south america , have been taking courses in india every year under our international technical and economic cooperation program .'
p823
aS'i however believe , that this is not enough .'
p824
aS'we intend to substantially increase the same .'
p825
aS'to share indias expertise in information technology , we will establish centres of excellence in information technology , in south american countries .'
p826
aS'india also offers to expand cooperation , in areas like tele-medicine , tele-education and e-governance .'
p827
aS'we extend our space capabilities , for weather forecasting , resource mapping and disaster management .'
p828
aS'our ongoing parliament session in delhi my governments first prevents me from spending more time here , on this visit .'
p829
aS'but , i look forward to returning to this great continent ; of beauty , opportunities and warm people .'

S'i am visiting nepal from 3 to 4 august 2014 at the invitation of the government of nepal .'
p833
aS'i am excited about my visit and pleased that i am able to go there within weeks of assuming office as prime minister .'
p834
aS'my visit reflects our shared heritage of nature , history , culture , spiritualism and religion .'
p835
aS'it highlights the high priority that my government attaches to our relations with nepal and our determination to take our relationship to an entirely new level .'
p836
aS'my visit will be the first bilateral visit by an indian prime minister to nepal in 17 years .'
p837
aS'i was delighted that prime minister sushil koirala had graced my swearing in ceremony with his presence , which demonstrated the solidarity of the people of nepal with india and our shared commitment to democracy .'
p838
aS'the india-nepal joint commission meeting chaired by our respective foreign ministers also met recently after a long gap of 23 years and reviewed the entire gamut of our bilateral relations and cooperation with a focus on economic relations , trade and connectivity .'
p839
aS'during my visit , i will have the opportunity to hold detailed discussions with the nepalese leadership on the entire gamut of bilateral relations .'
p840
aS'i look forward to working with the leadership of nepal to forge a new relationship for the new century between our two rapidly transforming countries .'
p841
aS'we will identify steps to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in key sectors , including trade and investment , hydro power , agriculture and agro-processing , environment , tourism , education , culture and sports .'
p842
aS'i will also discuss with nepali leadership and their business leaders how we can harness the full potential of the new digital age to empower and create new opportunities for the youth of the two countries .'
p843
aS'nepal has made admirable progress in its peace process and political transition towards a multiparty democracy .'
p844
aS'the successful conduct of the constituent assembly-cum-parliamentary elections in november 2013 is yet another tribute to the sagacity of the nepalese leadership and the people of nepal .'
p845
aS'i am truly grateful to the people and the elected representatives of nepal for giving me the rare honour of addressing the parliament of nepal .'
p846
aS'as a close friend and neighbour , we have had the privilege of being a leading partner in nepals socio-economic development .'
p847
aS'we are committed to continuing our support to nepal in its development efforts .'
p848
aS'our ongoing major projects for development of border infrastructure will usher in economic prosperity to people living on both sides of the border and also enhance connectivity .'
p849
aS'during the visit , we will explore the ways to further strengthen our development cooperation .'
p850
aS'i will also discuss with the nepalese leadership the steps to further strengthen people-to-people contacts between our countries , and how to connect lives across our open borders more seamlessly , particularly among the youth .'
p851
aS'i hope my visit will open a new chapter in india -nepal relations , characterized by more frequent political engagement and closer cooperation across the full spectrum of our extraordinarily broad-based relations , which will serve as a model and catalyst for south asian partnership for prosperity .'
p852
aa(lp853
S'national security advisor shri ajit doval ji , chief of army staff general dalbir singh ji , lieutenant general hooda ji , air marshal soman ji and all the brave officers and soldiers of the army and air force present here .'
p854
aS'i am privileged to address those who are associated with defence forces and i believe in military , bravery is respected more than the position one holds .'
p855
aS'army follows a hierarchical system but courage is a tradition and for those who serve this tradition in an exemplary manner particularly wait for that moment when they will be called for serving their nation and they live for that tradition every moment .'
p856
aS'this in itself is a distinct feeling .'
p857
aS'for the soldiers , there is only one yearning in life , to work and serve the country .'
p858
aS'you can see a feeling of restlessness in a soldier who has retired from army but has not faced any challenges during his service and if fielded a similar question about his service in army .'
p859
aS'he will tend to think that though he has participated in the daily parade but has not contributed to the force .'
p860
aS'for him in his heart the meaning of work in the army is not to kill someone or to be killed , the biggest inspiration for a soldier is to dedicate his life for someone elses life .'
p861
aS'the respect of your mother who gave birth to you is million times more than what you can have .'
p862
aS'i salute those mothers who gave birth to such brave warriors and instilled the right values in them and also instilled a do and die inspiration for their motherland india .'
p863
aS'i am not aware of a single mother who has feeling in her heart that though she has given birth to a son but he dedicates his life only for serving motherland india and not his own mother .'
p864
aS'this extraordinary inspiration can only be given by a mother and due to this your life not only secures our national borders but also provides assurance of security to 125 million people .'
p865
aS'if you ask what are the dreams of those 125 million people then they will say that our motherland should either become a vishwa guru ( teacher of the world ) or a jagat janani ( provider of the world ) .'
p866
aS'our 125 million brothers and sisters want to live a happy and peaceful life , even poorest of the poor child should not sleep hungry at night and at least there should be one roof above their head with a proper access to education .'
p867
aS'that is the reason i am saying that you all are not just for protection of border or for the protection of geographical structure .'
p868
aS'your life in an indirect way is the guarantee of millions of life .'
p869
aS'and until there is peace and security in the country development is impossible .'
p870
aS'the preconditions of development are peace , security , brotherhood , goodwill .'
p871
aS'our army is an example of brotherhood - there is no distinction on the basis of language , wealth and there is a feeling of being a family .'
p872
aS'the term fauji ( soldier ) in itself seems like you are a very own part of the system which you can relate to and this honour does not come overnight .'
p873
aS'these get developed under a certain tradition and this feeling comes when every moment this tradition is kept alive .'
p874
aS'an army can not be made capable unless the systems behind it are well accomplished .'
p875
aS'the term planning here is not restricted to the cantonment or the government , but also towards his village and family which particularly need to be strengthened .'
p876
aS'the soldier must have faith that even if he sacrifices his life for the country , the country will take care of his family and leave any stone unturned for his familys well-being .'
p877
aS'it is the responsibility of the country and government that the faith vested in it should not be shaken .'
p878
aS'there should not be any question mark in the mind of the soldier posted on the border .'
p879
aS'in the political field , i used to work for an organization .'
p880
aS'i came quite late in the world of electoral politics and governance .'
p881
aS'i have utlilised my earlier life in mobilizing the cadres .'
p882
aS'whenever i addressed my party workers , i used to tell them because we live in an atmosphere of electoral politics , party workers tend to seek ticket for election and if they are denied the same they ought to get frustrated due to it and feeling of even doing something incorrect creeps inside the mind .'
p883
aS'this is a normal course of political field .'
p884
aS'during training , i used to tell my party workers a story , which i want to share with you all .'
p885
aS'i used to tell them that when an army soldier wants to take leave on the occasion of festival of raksha bandhan ( sister tying rakhi or a thread at the wrist of her brother for her protection ) .'
p886
aS'he is normally sanctioned the leave at the last moment .'
p887
aS'he somehow packs his round luggage and rushes for his home .'
p888
aS'in order to reach the nearest railway station , he takes whatever first mode of transport comes his way , whether its truck or tempo .'
p889
aS'due to last minute rush , the passengers do not allow him to enter in a coach as he does not have reservation for travel .'
p890
aS'you can image the similar scenario of fight everyday at jammu station .'
p891
aS'the soldier does not get a place to sit as people here are used to soldiers on a daily basis so he stands for twenty four hours , thirty hours , sixty hours on the train without reservation to reach home .'
p892
aS'if in some case , he misses the train though he has left with the dream of getting rakhi tied by his sister but reaches home a day late .'
p893
aS'in the interim before he reaches home due to delay his sister is waiting and the soldier travelling in the train has the image of his sister .'
p894
aS'he can see the rakhi but can not not reach home on time and feels mental agony .'
p895
aS'when he reaches home , his mother , daughter , sister all are crying and upon tying of rakhi , there is a sense of happiness .'
p896
aS'mother is sick so he tries to extend his leave but leave is not approved , so he comes back and resumes duty .'
p897
aS'mother has to be operated he goes again .'
p898
aS'for operation he wanders from the house of one doctor to other and the doctor demands money in advance .'
p899
aS'he does not have so much of money with him .'
p900
aS'at that time , the he is annoyed .'
p901
aS'can he not see , i am a soldier serving my nation and here my mother is dying and he is not doing the operation for want of money ?'
p902
aS'child wants to go to school but the school is not giving him admission .'
p903
aS'a soldier wants his child to get a good education even though he has studied in a simple school but the school wants ex amount of fee to admit the child .'
p904
aS'he is very annoyed , when he thinks about the doctor who has not treated his mother , towards the school who denied admission to his child and towards the rail system which does not allow him to reach on time on the occasion of rakhi .'
p905
aS'when he gets the news , that his mother was not operated and she died , so many negative things cross his mind .'
p906
aS'if he analyzes the event one by one , then he feels , for whom should i lay my life ?'
p907
aS'should i die for the people , who are not admitting my child to the school ?'
p908
aS'these are the people who were not performing the operation in hospital , when my mother was dying , why should i lay my life for them ?'
p909
aS'after seeing all this also just see the strength of the soldier , see his temperament , see his upbringing , whenever the situation arises and the bugle rings , he still puts the gun on his shoulder and says bharat maata ki jai ( hail mother india ) and marches ahead .'
p910
aS'he never thinks , what the doctor did to his mother , what the teacher did to his child or whether he reached on time on the day of rakhi or not , he chants the mantra of love live mother india and marches forward to the action scene .'
p911
aS'this is not a small gesture , this is not an usual thing .'
p912
aS'i would tell my party workers that we must take inspiration from these soldiers .'
p913
aS'these soldiers never get the respect and honour that they deserve but when it is required they serve their motherland india they put the gun on their shoulders , chant bharat maata ki jai ( hail mother india ) and march ahead .'
p914
aS'this temperament , this strength is essential for the protection of dignity , self-esteem and the pride of the nation and india takes pride in the fact that we have such an outstanding army .'
p915
aS'whether it is navy , land or air , we have a chain of proud , daredevil , devout , soldiers who are ready to sacrifice their lives and this brings a sense of pride in us .'
p916
aS'whenever , i come to meet them , i get an inspiration to serve my country even more .'
p917
aS'i have not come here to tell you all this , i used to be amongst you all when i was the chief minister of gujarat , as i used to visit the border to celebrate diwali there .'
p918
aS'i went there not to tell anything to them but to get my battery of patriotism charged a little more , because i know your life will provide us the inspiration .'
p919
aS'army soldiers do not want to distance themselves from the society in general but want to have coordination with them and that gives strength .'
p920
aS'had there been no coordination between the people of leh and ladakh and the army soldiers and had a tashi-nagia shepherd who herds cow and sheep not met an army officer then we would have not known of the kargil infiltration of the pakistan army for a long time .'
p921
aS'due to the information received from a local shepherd who grazed cow , buffalo and goat informed army soldiers , awakening the nation about the impending war which we resultantly won .'
p922
aS'in todays age , the wars on the fought on the borders have almost stopped .'
p923
aS'it is our misfortune that that our given our neighbours mentality of having lost the strength to fight a conventional war but the chain of killing innocent civilians continues unabated through the proxy war waged .'
p924
aS'how many innocent people are being killed due to this ?'
p925
aS'these cowards have forced our soldiers to sacrifice their lives due to this proxy war than fighting the actual war .'
p926
aS'the proxy war is not just a crisis in india but it has engulfed the whole world .'
p927
aS'therefore , as much there is a need for military power in the world , the requirement of humanitarian forces to come together against this menace is important .'
p928
aS'the more worlds humanitarian powers come together , more they will be able to alienate the violent forces , the humanitarian forces will defeat the violent forces .'
p929
aS'we are dedicated to the protection of humanitarian thoughts , humanitarian values , humanitarian strengths and the civilized tradition .'
p930
aS'and for this india is bound by its words , duty and commitment and we want to move forward with this belief .'
p931
aS'you might have seen the new budget , the  one rank , one pension scheme showed our commitment and made you happy .'
p932
aS'after independence the soldiers of our country were awaiting for the national war memorial to be constructed .'
p933
aS'i promise you that it will be made and it will be made with lot of honour and pride and millions of people from india will take inspiration from it .'
p934
aS'it is for those people who lived for us and died for us and this will continue to inspire us forever .'
p935
aS'our armed forces should be modern and our armed forces should not lack any required resources and india should become self-reliant in the field of security .'
p936
aS'i have taken a very big decision in the budget for it .'
p937
aS'why cant we arrange to make everything within india than bringing them from outside our country ?'
p938
aS'in defence , fdi should come , new technology should come and the defence equipment should be made in india utilizing our current serving defence personnel that include engineers , technical staff and skilled personnel .'
p939
aS'we are working towards the deployment of retired defence personnel in the defence manufacturing system to utilize their strength , on how to utilize the foreign funds and how to provide the best of best defence safeguard mechanism and we are moving towards it in a much planned way .'
p940
aS'i once again , through this brave soldier in whose name this building has been named convey my respect and tribute to all the martyrs .'
p941
aS'i am proud of your duty , skill and courage and as your leader , i assure you that this country is for you and will always be proud of your sacrifice and timeless effort .'
p942
aS'my best wishes to you all .'
p943
aS'please speak after me long live mother india , vande matram , vande mataram , vande mataram , vande mataram , vande mataram , vande mataram !'
p944
aa(lp945
S'his excellency president of india , respected vice president , respected speaker , respected manmohan singh ji , respected advani ji , all present respected senior gentlemen , brothers and sisters .'
p946
aS'i heartily congratulate all the three great gentlemen who are being felicitated for their excellent work .'
p947
aS'i am hopeful that this tradition being followed for the past few years will inspire all the parliamentarians .'
p948
aS'each one will feel that in their respective roles as parliamentarians one should try and achieve high levels of conduct , depth in speech and clarity in thought as maintained by these great senior members .'
p949
aS'these kinds of thoughts would inspire all new members like us .'
p950
aS'i agree that there are lot of intellectual talent in the house and i see people who are capable of presenting their word beautifully but the house can not run as an ornate articulation or as a remarkable art of presentation .'
p951
aS'till there is a seamless integration of leadership , duty and oration , just the words will fail to make an impact on the house or inspire the nation .'
p952
aS'and so those who won these awards today are the ones who have not only been good orators but are equally capable leaders and dutiful members .'
p953
aS'the country expects a lot from the parliament of india .'
p954
aS'we give the awards within the parliament , but sometime there should be a public survey , on how the public rates the house and in a very professional way the public opinion should be presented .'
p955
aS'how does the common man view the entire house , what does he feel , maybe that may inspire us to think our way forward .'
p956
aS'i would request the speaker to call the speakers of all vidhan sabhas if possible and start this tradition in the state assemblies too .'
p957
aS'i think this will be a good step that we can take .'
p958
aS'another thing i would like to point out is that when i was in the vidhan sabha and now for some time when i have been in parliament , the humour and sarcasm which was an explicit feature is now missing , something that we have heard and read so much about .'
p959
aS'it has practically vanished from our party system .'
p960
aS'one reason someone makes a remark , then how will those who are on air 24 hours interpret it and will they debate this for 24 hours .'
p961
aS'so , the ones who can speak are scared and i think we need to seriously contemplate on this .'
p962
aS'i have heard of old incidents , of which i remember two or three episodes .'
p963
aS'once there was a programme in the house to commemorate the 50 years of independence .'
p964
aS'i had come to the house to hear it and some debate was going on and probably sharad pawar ji spoke first and then sushma ji spoke .'
p965
aS'she joked and said i dont understand whether it is sharad pawar or lalita pawar .'
p966
aS'the way i saw that scene , the way sharad pawar enjoyed that jibe , such a holy atmosphere prevailed .'
p967
aS'and that remark was not blown out of proportion by anyone in the print media or the electronic media .'
p968
aS'there is a casual sense of humour in our parliament .'
p969
aS'and as our honourable speaker and arun jaitely ji mentioned , sharp words can get you 24 hour footage but it can neither be effective nor inspirational .'
p970
aS'that does not mean that everything should be done sweetly .'
p971
aS'that is not what i am saying .'
p972
aS'the need of the hour is to present the parliament in a way that it becomes inspirational for the future generations .'
p973
aS'every sentence uttered in the parliament has its value , that it should not be undignified .'
p974
aS'and this is a collective responsibility .'
p975
aS'this is our collective responsibility , it is not about this political party , that political party , or about this or that specific individual but it is about our collective responsibility .'
p976
aS'dr.'
p977
aS'karan singh is a very experienced individual .'
p978
aS'he is still bound by the cultural traditions .'
p979
aS'whatever disappointments he has shared , i am sure they will be helpful in self introspection .'
p980
aS'for a distinguished person like him who for so many years has served the nation through this parliament , to know his pain , to understand his disappointment and then to modulate as per his hopes and expectations will usher in a new dignity in the house .'
p981
aS'i congratulate these three dignitaries once again .'
p982
aS'i am new to the parliament .'
p983
aS'i also have to learn a lot .'
p984
aS'there are so many senior members , and by hearing them and understanding their views , i too will gain something .'
p985
aS'sharad ji said that once if he sits down to chat with the president he does not feel like getting up .'
p986
aS'i am telling you the truth .'
p987
aS'he gives such a lot of information with date and time and name , it is surprising .'
p988
aS'like sharad ji said , he wonders what kind of software does the president has in his mind .'
p989
aS'he said that what one would gain after reading an entire book , more than that one would have acquire half of the knowledge about india can be understood by having a conversation with him .'
p990
aS'every parliamentarian should have the intention to remember dates , events , analysis of the situation and an ability to grasp things .'
p991
aS'all these can be learned from these seasoned members .'
p992
aS'and it is true that clarity of the thought , faith in conviction and correction in acts can help us take the dignity of the parliament to a new level .'
p993
aS'i congratulate you once again .'
p994
aS'thank you !'

aa(lp996
S'prime minister shri narendra modi addressed the nation from the ramparts of the red fort on the 68th independence day .'
p997
aS'following is the english rendering of the prime ministers address on the occasion : my dear countrymen , today , all indians in the country and also abroad are celebrating the festival of independence .'
p998
aS'on this day of sacred festival of independence , the prime servant of india extends greetings to all dear countrymen .'
p999
aS'i am present amidst you not as the prime minister , but as the prime servant .'
p1000
aS'the freedom struggle was fought for so many years , so many generations laid down their lives , innumerable people sacrificed their lives and youth , spent their entire lives behind bars .'
p1001
aS'today , i pay my respect , greetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the countrys independence .'
p1002
aS'i also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this country on the pious occasion of indias independence , and recall all those martyrs who had laid down their lives in indias struggle for freedom .'
p1003
aS'the day of independence is a festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the welfare of mother india , and also for the welfare of the poor , oppressed , dalits , the exploited & the backward people of our country .'
p1004
aS'my dear countrymen , a national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild the national character .'
p1005
aS'this national festival inspires us to resolve ourselves to lead a life where our character gets refined further , to dedicate ourselves to the nation and our every activity is linked to the interest of the nation and only then this festival of freedom can be a festival of inspiration to take india to newer heights .'
p1006
aS'my dear countrymen , this nation has neither been built by political leaders nor by rulers nor by governments .'
p1007
aS'this nation has been built by our farmers , our workers , our mothers and sisters , our youth .'
p1008
aS'the country has reached here today because of generation to generation rigours undertaken by our sages , our saints , our maestros , our teachers , our scientists and social workers .'
p1009
aS'these great people and these great generations , who had worked for the country throughout their lives , deserve our deepest respect .'
p1010
aS'this is the beauty of indias constitution , this is its capability which has made it possible that today a boy from small town , a poor family has got the opportunity to pay homage to the tri-colour of india at the ramparts of lal quila ( red fort ) .'
p1011
aS'this is the strength of indias democracy .'
p1012
aS'this is an invaluable legacy which we have inherited from our architects of the constitution .'
p1013
aS'i pay my respects to those architects of the constitution of india today .'
p1014
aS'brothers and sisters , today if we have reached here after independence , it is because of the contribution of all the prime ministers , all the governments and even the governments of all the states .'
p1015
aS'i want to express my feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous governments and ex-prime ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day india to such heights and who have added to the countrys glory .'
p1016
aS'this country has been built on such foundation of ancient cultural heritage , where we were told of only onemantra during vedic period , which is indicative of our work culture , which we have learnt , we have memorized sangachchhdhvam samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam .'
p1017
aS'we walk together , we move together , we think together , we resolve together and together we take this country forward .'
p1018
aS'having imbibed this basic mantra , 125 crores of countrymen have taken the nation forward .'
p1019
aS'yesterday only the first parliamentary session of the new government had concluded .'
p1020
aS'today , i can proudly say that the session of parliament reflects our thinking and it is a reflection of our intentions .'
p1021
aS'we are not for moving forward on the basis of majority , we are not interested to move forward by virtue of majority .'
p1022
aS'we want to move ahead on the basis of strong consensus .'
p1023
aS"sangachhadhwam '' and , therefore , the nation has witnessed the entire session of parliament ."
p1024
aS'having taken all the parties and opposition along while working shoulder to shoulder , we achieved an unprecedented success and the credit for this does not go to the prime minister alone , the credit does not go to the people sitting in the government , the credit for this goes to the opposition also , the credit goes to all the leaders of opposition too and also all the members from opposition .'
p1025
aS'from the ramparts of red fort , quite proudly i salute all the members of parliament , i also salute all the political parties and by virtue of their strong support , we could take some important decisions intended to take the nation forward and yesterday the session of parliament had concluded .'
p1026
aS'brothers and sisters , i am an outsider for delhi , i am not a native of delhi .'
p1027
aS'i have no idea about the administration and working of this place .'
p1028
aS'i have been quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last two months while being an outsider , i had an insider view and i was astonished .'
p1029
aS'it is not a political platform , rather it is a platform of a national policy and , therefore , my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective .'
p1030
aS'i have already said , i salute all the ex-prime ministers and earlier governments who have brought the country thus far .'
p1031
aS'but i am going to say something else and it may not be seen from political point of view .'
p1032
aS'when i came to delhi and noticed an insider view , i felt what it was and i was surprised to see it .'
p1033
aS'it seemed as if dozens of separate governments are running at the same time in one main government .'
p1034
aS'it appeared that everyone has its own fiefdom .'
p1035
aS'i could observe disunity and conflict among them .'
p1036
aS'one department is taking on the other department and taking on to the extent that two departments of the same government are fighting against each other by approaching supreme court .'
p1037
aS'this disunity , this conflict among people of the same country !'
p1038
aS'how come we can take the country forward ?'
p1039
aS'and that is why i have started making efforts for razing those walls ; i have started making efforts at making the government , not an assembled entity , but an organic unity , an organic entity , a harmonious whole- with one aim , one mind , one direction , one energy .'
p1040
aS'lets resolve to steer the country to one destination .'
p1041
aS'we have it in us to move in that direction .'
p1042
aS'a few days back .'
p1043
aS'.'
p1044
ag1044
aS'nowadays newspapers are full of news that modijis government has come , officers are reaching office on time , offices open in time , and people get there in time .'
p1045
aS'i observed that indias national newspapers , tv media were carrying these news items prominently .'
p1046
aS'as the head of the government i could have derived pleasure in the fact that everything started going on time , cleanliness got the attention , but i was not taking pleasure , i was feeling pained .'
p1047
aS'that thing , i want to tell today in public .'
p1048
aS'and why , because if government officers arrive office in time , does that make a news ?'
p1049
aS'and if that makes news , it shows how low we have fallen .'
p1050
aS'it becomes a proof of that , and thats how , brothers and sisters , the governments have run ?'
p1051
aS"today in the face of global competition , when we have to realize the dreams of millions of indians , the country can not run on the lines of  it happens '' ,  it goes '' ."
p1052
aS'in order to fulfil the aspirations of masses , we have to sharpen the tool called the government machinery , we have to make it keen , more dynamic , and it is in this direction that we are working .'
p1053
aS'my countrymen , its not long since i have come from outside delhi , but i give you an assurance that the people in the government are very capable - from the peon to the cabinet secretary , everybody is capable , everybody has a power , they have experience .'
p1054
aS'i want to awaken that power , i want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the welfare of nation through that power and i shall definitely do it .'
p1055
aS'i want to assure the countrymen that we will achieve that , we will definitely do that .'
p1056
aS'i could not say this on 16th may , but today after my experience of two-two and half months , keeping the tricolor as witness , i am saying on 15th of august that it is possible , it will be achieved .'
p1057
aS'brothers and sisters , time has come to give a serious thought to the fact that whether we have a duty to create india of the dreams of those great people who gave us freedom , whether we have a national character ?'
p1058
aS'brothers and sisters , can someone please tell me as to whether he or she has ever introspected in the evening after a full days work as to whether his or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not , whether his or her actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not , whether the actions have been directed in countrys welfare or not ?'
p1059
aS'whether it should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen that every step in life should be in the countrys interests ?'
p1060
aS'unfortunately , we have an environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some work , he begins by saying  what does it mean for me ?'
p1061
aS"'' he begins by saying  what does it involve for me ?"
p1062
aS"'' and when he come to know that it does not entail any benefit for him , immediately he says  why should i bother ?"
p1063
aS"'' we have to rise above the feelings of  what does it mean for me '' and  why should i bother '' ."
p1064
aS'everything is not for self interest only .'
p1065
aS'there are certain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine this national character .'
p1066
aS"we have to rise above the feelings of  why should i bother '' and  what does it mean for me '' and instead we have to think that  i am for nations interest and in this field , i am going to lead '' ."
p1067
aS'we have to inculcate this sentiment .'
p1068
aS'brothers and sisters , when we hear about the incidents of rape , we hang our heads in shame .'
p1069
aS'people come out with different arguments , someone indulges in psycho analysis , but brothers and sisters , today from this platform , i want to ask those parents , i want to ask every parent that you have a daughter of 10 or 12 years age , you are always on the alert , every now and then you keep on asking where are you going , when would you come back , inform immediately after you reach .'
p1070
aS'parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions , but have any parents ever dared to ask their son as to where he is going , why he is going out , who his friends are .'
p1071
aS'after all , a rapist is also somebodys son .'
p1072
aS'he also has parents .'
p1073
aS'as parents , have we ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going .'
p1074
aS'if every parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have been imposed on our daughters , try to do this with your sons , try to ask such questions of them .'
p1075
aS'my dear brothers and sisters , the law will take its own course , strict action will be taken , but as a member of the society , as parents , we also have some responsibilities .'
p1076
aS'if somebody tells me that those who have taken guns on their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists , are terrorists , but they are also somebodys children .'
p1077
aS'i would like to ask of such parents if they had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path .'
p1078
aS'every parent must take this responsibility , he must know that his misguided son is bent on killing innocent people .'
p1079
aS'he is not able to serve himself nor his family nor the country .'
p1080
aS'i want to say to those youngsters who have chosen the path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are , it is all because of mother india only that they have got it .'
p1081
aS'whoever you are it is all because of your parents .'
p1082
aS'i want to ask you to think how green , how beautiful and how beneficial this earth can become if you shoulder the plough instead of the gun which spills blood on this land .'
p1083
aS'how long shall we have bloodshed on this land , how long shall we take the lives of the innocent people and what have we got after all this ?'
p1084
aS'the path of violence has not yielded anything to us .'
p1085
aS'brothers and sisters , i had gone to nepal recently .'
p1086
aS'there i said something publicly to draw the attention of the whole world .'
p1087
aS'there was a time when the emperor ashoka who had chosen the path of wars , got converted to the path of buddha at the sight of violence .'
p1088
aS'there was a time in nepal when their youngsters had opted for the path of violence but today i witness that the same youngsters are waiting for their constitution .'
p1089
aS'the same people associated with them are framing the constitution .'
p1090
aS'and i further said that if nepal could present the best example of moving from the weapons to the books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in the world to abandon the path of violence .'
p1091
aS'brothers and sisters , if nepal , land of budha , can give message to the world then why cant india too do the same ?'
p1092
aS'so its the call of the hour that we renounce the path of violence and take the path of brotherhood .'
p1093
aS'brothers and sisters , for one reason or the other , we have had communal tensions for ages .'
p1094
aS'this led to the division of the country .'
p1095
aS'even after independence , we have had to face the poison of casteism and communalism .'
p1096
aS'how long these evils will continue ?'
p1097
aS'whom does it benefit ?'
p1098
aS'we have had enough of fights , many have been killed .'
p1099
aS'friends , look behind and you will find that nobody has benefited from it .'
p1100
aS'except casting a slur on mother india , we have done nothing .'
p1101
aS'therefore , i appeal to all those people that whether it is the poison of casteism , communalism , regionalism , discrimination on social and economic basis , all these are obstacles in our way forward .'
p1102
aS'lets resolve for once in our hearts , lets put a moratorium on all such activities for ten years , we shall march ahead to a society which will be free from all such tensions .'
p1103
aS'and you will see that how much strength we get from peace , unity , goodwill and brotherhood .'
p1104
aS'lets experiment it for once .'
p1105
aS'my dear countrymen , believe in my words , i do assure you .'
p1106
aS'shun all the sins committed so far , give up that way , follow the way of goodwill and brotherhood , and lets resolve to take the country forward .'
p1107
aS'i believe we can do that .'
p1108
aS'with advancement of science , brothers and sisters , we have a rising feeling of modernity in our mind , but what do we do ?'
p1109
aS'have we ever thought what the sex ratio in the country is like ?'
p1110
aS'940 girls are born against per thousand boys .'
p1111
aS'who is causing this imbalance in the society ?'
p1112
aS'certainly not god .'
p1113
aS'i request the doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just to line their own pockets .'
p1114
aS'i advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice daughters in the hope of son .'
p1115
aS'sometimes mother-father feel tempted to have son in the hope of supporting them in old age .'
p1116
aS'i am a person who has worked in public life .'
p1117
aS'i have come across families with five sons , each having bungalows , access to fleet of cars , but parents are forced to live in old-age homes , vriddhashrams .'
p1118
aS'i have seen such families .'
p1119
aS'i have also seen families with only daughter as progeny , that daughter sacrifices her dreams , doesnt get married , and spends entire life in taking care of old parents .'
p1120
aS'this disparity points to female foeticide and the polluted and tainted mind the 21st century has .'
p1121
aS'we will have to liberate from it , and that is message to us of this freedom festival .'
p1122
aS'recently commonwealth games were organized .'
p1123
aS'indian sportspersons brought glory to the country .'
p1124
aS'nearly 64 of our sportspersons won .'
p1125
aS'our sportspersons brought 64 medals .'
p1126
aS'but of them 29 are girls .'
p1127
aS'lets feel proud and clap for them .'
p1128
aS'girls also contribute to indias fame and glory .'
p1129
aS'lets recognise it .'
p1130
aS'lets take them along , shoulder to shoulder .'
p1131
aS'this way we can get over the evils that have crept in social life .'
p1132
aS'therefore , brothers and sisters , we have to proceed in that direction as a social and national character .'
p1133
aS'brothers and sisters , development is the only way forward for the country .'
p1134
aS'good governance is the only way .'
p1135
aS'there are only these two tracks to take the country forward - good governance and development , we can move forward only by taking them with us .'
p1136
aS'we wish to move forward with the intent of taking them with us .'
p1137
aS'when i talk of good governance , you tell me , when i ask a person in private job , he tells that he does the job ; when you ask the same from a person in government job , he says that i do the service .'
p1138
aS'both earn , but for one it is job while for the other it is service .'
p1139
aS'i ask a question from all brothers and sisters in government service , whether the word service has not lost its strength , its identity ?'
p1140
aS'persons in government service are not doing job , they are doing service .'
p1141
aS'we have to revive this feeling , we have to take this feeling forward as a national character , we have to move forward in this direction .'
p1142
aS'brothers and sisters , whether the citizens of the country should take steps for the welfare of the nation or not ?'
p1143
aS'you imagine , if this 125 crores of countrymen move one step forward , then the country moves 125 crore steps forward .'
p1144
aS'the meaning of democracy is not just limited to electing a government , but its meaning is that 125 crore of citizens work together joining shoulder with the government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the country , this is the meaning of democracy .'
p1145
aS'we have to create partnership with the people .'
p1146
aS'we have to proceed under public-private partnership .'
p1147
aS'we have to proceed along with the participation of the people .'
p1148
aS'but , please tell me why our farmers commit suicide ?'
p1149
aS'a farmer takes loan from the moneylender , but fails to repay his loans .'
p1150
aS'he takes loan for the wedding of his daughter , but fails to repay .'
p1151
aS'he will have to suffer hardships during his whole life .'
p1152
aS'he chooses to commit suicide .'
p1153
aS'who will save the poor families of such farmers ?'
p1154
aS'brothers and sisters , i have come here with a pledge to launch a scheme on this festival of freedom .'
p1155
aS'it will be calledpradhanmantri jan-dhan yojana .'
p1156
aS'i wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country with the facility of bank accounts through this yojana .'
p1157
aS'there are millions of families who have mobile phones but no bank accounts .'
p1158
aS'we have to change this scenario .'
p1159
aS'economic resources of the country should be utilized for the well-being of the poor .'
p1160
aS'the change will commence from this point .'
p1161
aS'this yojana will open the window .'
p1162
aS'therefore , an account holder under pradhanmantri jan-dhan yojana will be given a debit card .'
p1163
aS'an insurance of one lakh rupees will be guaranteed with that debit card for each poor family , so that such families are covered with the insurance of one lakh rupees in case of any crisis in their lives .'
p1164
aS'my brothers and sisters , it is a country of young people .'
p1165
aS'the 65 percent population of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years .'
p1166
aS'our country has the largest number of youths in the world .'
p1167
aS'have we ever thought of deriving an advantage out of it ?'
p1168
aS'today , the world needs a skilled workforce .'
p1169
aS'today , india also needs a skilled workforce .'
p1170
aS'at times , we look for a good driver but he is not available , we look for a plumber , but he is not available .'
p1171
aS'if we need a good cook , he is not available .'
p1172
aS'we have young people , they are unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are not available .'
p1173
aS'if we have to promote the development of our country then our mission has to be skill development and skilled india .'
p1174
aS'millions and millions of indian youth should go for acquisition of skills and there should be a network across the country for this and not the archaic systems .'
p1175
aS'they should acquire the skills which could contribute towards making india a modern country .'
p1176
aS'whenever they go to any country in the world , their skills must be appreciated and we want to go for a two pronged development .'
p1177
aS'i also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs and the ones who are not capable of creating jobs and do not have the opportunities , they must be in a position to face their counterparts in any corner of the world while keeping their heads high by virtue of their hard work and their dexterity of hands and win the hearts of people around the world through their skills .'
p1178
aS'we want to go for the capacity building of such young people .'
p1179
aS'my brothers and sisters , having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace , i want to accomplish this .'
p1180
aS'brothers and sisters , the world has undergone a change .'
p1181
aS'my dear countrymen , the world has changed .'
p1182
aS'now india can not decide its future by remaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner .'
p1183
aS'the economics of the world have changed and , therefore , we will have to act accordingly .'
p1184
aS'government have taken many decisions recently , made some announcements in the budget and i call upon the world and call upon the indians spread world over that if we have to provide more and more employment to the youth , we will have to promote manufacturing sector .'
p1185
aS'if we have to develop a balance between imports and exports , we will have to strengthen manufacturing sector .'
p1186
aS'if we have to put in use the education , the capability of the youth , we will have to go for manufacturing sector and for this hindustan also will have to lend its full strength , but we also invite world powers .'
p1187
aS"therefore i want to appeal all the people world over , from the ramparts of the red fort ,  come , make in india '' ,  come , manufacture in india '' ."
p1188
aS'sell in any country of the world but manufacture here .'
p1189
aS'we have got skill , talent , discipline , and determination to do something .'
p1190
aS"we want to give the world an favourable opportunity that come here ,  come , make in india '' and we will say to the world , from electrical to electronics ,  come , make in india '' , from automobiles to agro value addition  come , make in india '' , paper or plastic ,  come , make in india '' , satellite or submarine  come , make in india '' ."
p1191
aS'our country is powerful .'
p1192
aS'come , i am giving you an invitation .'
p1193
aS'brothers and sisters , i want to call upon the youth of the country , particularly the small people engaged in the industrial sector .'
p1194
aS'i want to call upon the youth working in the field of technical education in the country .'
p1195
aS"as i say to the world  come , make in india '' , i say to the youth of the country - it should be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the world ,  made in india '' ."
p1196
aS'this should be our dream .'
p1197
aS'whether , to serve the country , is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like bhagat singh ?'
p1198
aS"brothers and sisters , lal bahadur shastri had given the slogan  jai jawan , jai kisan '' ."
p1199
aS'a soldier sacrifices himself at the border and protects mother india .'
p1200
aS'similarly , a farmer serves mother india by filling the godowns with grains .'
p1201
aS'this is also nations service .'
p1202
aS'filling the granary is the biggest nations service that a farmer provides .'
p1203
aS"that is why lal bahadur shashtri had given the slogan of  jai jawan , jai kisan '' ."
p1204
aS'brothers and sisters , i would like to pose a question to my youngsters as to why despite them , we are forced to import even the smallest of things ?'
p1205
aS'my countrys youth can resolve it , they should conduct research , try to find out as to what type of items are imported by india and then each one should resolve that , through may be micro or small industries only , he would manufacture atleast one such item so that we need not import the same in future .'
p1206
aS'we should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to export such items .'
p1207
aS'if each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture atleast one such item , india can become a net exporter of goods .'
p1208
aS'i , therefore , urge upon the youth , in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would never compromise , atleast on two counts .'
p1209
aS'first , zero defect and , second again zero effect .'
p1210
aS'we should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero defect , that our exported goods are never returned to us .'
p1211
aS'we should manufacture goods with zero effect that they should not have a negative impact on the environment .'
p1212
aS'if we march ahead with the dream of zero defect in the manufacturing sector then , my brothers and sisters , i am confident that we would be able to achieve our goals .'
p1213
aS'brothers and sisters , the youth of india has completely transformed the identity of india in the world .'
p1214
aS'earlier , in what manner did the world know our country ?'
p1215
aS'till only 25-30 years back , if not more , there were many people in the world who thought that india was a country of snake charmers , it was a country which practiced in black magic .'
p1216
aS'the real identity of india had not reached the world , but my dear brothers and sisters , our youngsters , 20-22-23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with their skills in computers .'
p1217
aS'our young i .'
p1218
aS't .'
p1219
aS'professionals have given a new path of making a new identity of india .'
p1220
aS'if our country has this strength , can we think something about the country ?'
p1221
aS"our dream is , therefore , of  digital india '' ."
p1222
aS"when i talk of  digital india '' , i dont speak of the elite , it is for the poor people ."
p1223
aS'you can imagine what a quality education the children in villages will get , if all the villages of india are connected with broadband connectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the schools in every remote corner of the villages .'
p1224
aS'if we create a network of telemedicine in the places where there is a shortage of doctors , we can have a clear guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be provided to the poor people living in those areas .'
p1225
aS'the citizens of india have mobile phones in their hands , they have mobile connectivity , but can we walk in the direction of mobile governance ?'
p1226
aS'we have to move in a direction where every poor person is able to operate his bank account from his mobile , is able to demand various things from the government , can submit applications , can conduct all his business , while on the move , through mobile governance and if this has to be done , we have to move towards digital india and if we have to move towards digital india then we have a dream .'
p1227
aS'today we are importing electronic goods on a large scale .'
p1228
aS'friends , you will be surprised that we are bringing in these televisions , mobile phones , i-pads and all these electronic goods .'
p1229
aS'it is a necessity to import petroleum products , oil , diesel and petrol .'
p1230
aS'second to this is the import of our electronic goods .'
p1231
aS'if we move ahead with the dream of digital india to manufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at least there , how big can be the benefit for the treasury !'
p1232
aS'therefore , e-governance is what we need to take this idea of digital india forward .'
p1233
aS'e-governance is easy governance , effective governance and also economic governance .'
p1234
aS'e-governance paves the way for good governance .'
p1235
aS'there was a time when we used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country .'
p1236
aS'that was it .'
p1237
aS'i say that today it is it that has the potential to connect each and every citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra of unity with the help of digital india .'
p1238
aS'brothers and sisters , if we move ahead with all this then i believe that a digital india will have the potential to stand with the world on equal footing .'
p1239
aS'our youth have that capability , it is an opportunity for them .'
p1240
aS'brothers and sisters , we want to promote tourism .'
p1241
aS'tourism provides employment to the poorest of the poor .'
p1242
aS'gram seller earns something , auto-rickshaw driver earns something , pakoda seller earns something and tea seller also earns something .'
p1243
aS'when there is talk of tea seller , i feel a sense of belongingness .'
p1244
aS'tourism provide employment to the poorest of the poor .'
p1245
aS'but there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national character and that is - the filthiness all around us .'
p1246
aS'whether after independence , after so many years of independence , when we stand at the threshold of one and half decade of 21st century , we still want to live in filthiness ?'
p1247
aS'the first work i started here after formation of government is of cleanliness .'
p1248
aS'people wondered whether it is a work of a prime minister ?'
p1249
aS'people may feel that it is a trivial work for a prime minister but for me this a big work .'
p1250
aS'cleanliness is very big work .'
p1251
aS'whether our country can not be clean ?'
p1252
aS'if one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen decide that they will never spread filthiness , which power in the world has ability to spread filthiness in our cities and villages ?'
p1253
aS'cant we resolve this much ?'
p1254
aS'brothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi in 2019 .'
p1255
aS'how do we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi ?'
p1256
aS'mahatma gandhi , who gave us freedom , who brought so much honour to such a big country in the world , what do we give to mahatma gandhi ?'
p1257
aS'brothers and sisters , mahatma gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation closest to his heart .'
p1258
aS'whether we resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our village , city , street , area , school , temple , hospital , and what have you , by 2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi ?'
p1259
aS'this happens not just with the government , but with public participation .'
p1260
aS'thats why we have to do it together .'
p1261
aS'brother and sisters , we are living in 21st century .'
p1262
aS'has it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open ?'
p1263
aS'whether dignity of women is not our collective responsibility ?'
p1264
aS'the poor womenfolk of the village wait for the night ; until darkness descends , they cant go out to defecate .'
p1265
aS'what bodily torture they must be feeling , how many diseases that act might engender .'
p1266
aS'cant we just make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and sisters ?'
p1267
aS'brothers and sisters , somebody might feel that a big festival like 15th august is an occasion to talk big .'
p1268
aS'brothers and sisters , talking big has its importance , making announcements too has importance , but sometimes announcements raise hopes and when the hopes are not fulfilled , the society sinks into a state of despondency .'
p1269
aS'thats why are in favour of telling those things , which we can fulfil just within our sight .'
p1270
aS'brothers and sisters , you must be getting shocked to hear the prime minister speaking of cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the ramparts of the red fort .'
p1271
aS'brothers and sisters , i do not know how my speech is going to be criticised and how will people take it .'
p1272
aS'but this is my heartfelt conviction .'
p1273
aS'i come from a poor family , i have seen poverty .'
p1274
aS'the poor need respect and it begins with cleanliness .'
p1275
aS'i , therefore , have to launch a clean india campaign from 2nd october this year and carry it forward in 4 years .'
p1276
aS'i want to make a beginning today itself and that is - all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls .'
p1277
aS'only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway .'
p1278
aS'our parliamentarians utilizing mplad fund are there .'
p1279
aS'i appeal to them to spend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year .'
p1280
aS'the government should utilise its budget on providing toilets .'
p1281
aS'i call upon the corporate sector also to give priority to the provision of toilets in schools with your expenditure under corporate social responsibility .'
p1282
aS'this target should be finished within one year with the help of state governments and on the next 15th august , we should be in a firm position to announce that there is no school in india without separate toilets for boys and girls .'
p1283
aS'brothers and sisters , if we proceed with the dreams , we are in a position to realise them .'
p1284
aS'today , i wish to tell one more specific thing .'
p1285
aS'it has its own importance to discuss the matters and express the views of nations interest .'
p1286
aS'however , our members of parliament do not get opportunity though they are willing to do something .'
p1287
aS'they can express themselves , write to the government , agitate , give memoranda .'
p1288
aS'still they do not get opportunity to do something on their own .'
p1289
aS'today i have come to you with a new idea .'
p1290
aS'we are running so many schemes in the name of the prime minister in our country , there are numerous schemes in the name of various leaders .'
p1291
aS'however , today i am going to announce a scheme on behalf of the member of parliament- sansad aadarsh gram yojana .'
p1292
aS'we shall fix some parameters .'
p1293
aS'i urge upon the members of parliament to select any one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your constituency .'
p1294
aS'the parameters will be according to the time , space and situation of that locality .'
p1295
aS'it will include the conditions of health , cleanliness , atmosphere , greenery , cordiality etc .'
p1296
aS'on the basis of those parameters , each of our mps should make one village of his or her constituency a model village by 2016 .'
p1297
aS'cant we do at least this ?'
p1298
aS'shouldnt we do this ?'
p1299
aS'if we have to build a nation , we should start from the village .'
p1300
aS'make a model village .'
p1301
aS'the reason of fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme .'
p1302
aS'it takes time to formulate a scheme and then to implement it .'
p1303
aS'after 2016 , select two more villages for this purpose , before we go for the general elections in 2019 .'
p1304
aS'and after 2019 , each member of parliament , during his/her tenure of 5 years must establish at-least five model villages in his/her area .'
p1305
aS'i also call upon the members of parliament from urban areas to adopt one village of their choice .'
p1306
aS'i also urge upon the members of parliament from rajya sabha to adopt one of the villages .'
p1307
aS'if we provide one model village in each district of india then the surrounding villages shall be automatically inspired to follow that model .'
p1308
aS'let us establish a model village , let us establish a village well equipped with all systems and facilities .'
p1309
aS'the birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji happens to be on 11th october .'
p1310
aS"on 11th october , the occasion of birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji , i will present a complete blueprint of  snsad adharsh grm yojana '' ( members of parliament model village scheme ) before all members of parliament and state governments , and i urge upon state governments also that as per the feasibility in their respective states , all the members of legislative assembly resolve to establish a model village ."
p1311
aS'you can imagine all the members of legislative assembly and all the members of parliament in the country establishing a model village .'
p1312
aS"all of a sudden , there would be a model village in each block of india which could inspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new direction and , therefore , we want to move ahead under this '' snsad adarsh grm yojana '' ."
p1313
aS'my dear brothers and sisters , ever since our government has taken charge , there has been a discussion in the newspapers , on t .'
p1314
aS'v .'
p1315
aS'channels as to what would happen to planning commission .'
p1316
aS'i believe that when planning commission was constituted , it was done on the basis of the circumstances and the needs of those times .'
p1317
aS'in recent years , planning commission has contributed to the growth of the country in its own way .'
p1318
aS'i respect that , i am proud of that , but the prevalent situation in the country is different , global scenario has also changed , governments are no longer the centre of economic activities , the scope of such activities has broadened .'
p1319
aS'state governments have been at the center of development and i consider this a good indication .'
p1320
aS'if we have to take india forward , it can happen only be taking the states forward .'
p1321
aS'indias federal structure is more important today than in the last 60 years .'
p1322
aS'to strengthen our federal structure , to make our federal structure vibrant , to take our federal structure as a heritage of development , a team of chief minister and prime minister should be there , a joint team of the centre and the states should move forward , then to do this job , we will have to think about giving the planning commission a look .'
p1323
aS'so , i am saying from the rampart of the red fort that it is a very old system and it will have to be rejuvenated , it will have to be changed a lot .'
p1324
aS'sometimes it costs more to repair the old house , but , it gives us no satisfaction .'
p1325
aS'thereafter , we have a feeling that it would be better to construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period , we will replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new design and structure , a new body , a new soul , a new thinking , a new direction , a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country based on creative thinking , public-private partnership , optimum utilization of resources , utilization of youth power of the nation , to promote the aspirations of state governments seeking development , to empower the state governments and to empower the federal structure .'
p1326
aS'very shortly , we are about to move in a direction when this institute would be functioning in place of planning commission .'
p1327
aS'brothers and sisters , today , on 15th august , we also have the birth anniversary of maharishi aurobindo .'
p1328
aS'maharishi aurobindo , being a rebel , moved on to achieve the status of a yoga guru .'
p1329
aS'with regard to the destiny of india , he remarked ,  i have a faith that the divine power and spiritual heritage of india will play an important role towards the welfare of the world .'
p1330
aS"'' such sentiments were echoed by maharishi arvind ."
p1331
aS'i strongly believe in the words of legends .'
p1332
aS'i have great faith in the statements made by ascetics , sages & saints and thats why today at the ramparts of lal quila i am reminded of the words of swami viveknanda .'
p1333
aS'he had said -  i can see before my eyes mother india awakening once again .'
p1334
aS'my mother india would be seated as the world guru .'
p1335
aS'every indian would render service towards welfare of humanity .'
p1336
aS"this legacy of india would be useful for the welfare of the world '' ."
p1337
aS'these words were spoken by swami viveknanda ji in his own style .'
p1338
aS'friends , the words of viveknanda ji can never be untrue .'
p1339
aS'the words of viveknanda ji , his dream of seeing india ensconced as world guru , his vision , it is incumbent upon us to realize that dream .'
p1340
aS'this capable country , blessed with natural bounty , this country of youth can do much for the world in the coming days .'
p1341
aS'brothers and sisters , our foreign policy is a much talked about issue .'
p1342
aS'i clearly believe that indias foreign policy can be multi-dimensional .'
p1343
aS'but there is an important issue to which i want to draw your attention that the way we fought for freedom , we fought together , we were not separate at that time .'
p1344
aS'we were together .'
p1345
aS'which was the government with us ?'
p1346
aS'what were the weapons available to us ?'
p1347
aS'there was a gandhi , a sardar and lakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge empire .'
p1348
aS'didnt we win in the struggle of freedom against that empire ?'
p1349
aS'did we not defeat the foreign powers ?'
p1350
aS'did we not force them to leave india ?'
p1351
aS'we were the ones , they were our ancestors only who showed this might .'
p1352
aS'if the people of india could remove such a big empire without the power of the government , without weapons and even without resources , then friends , it is the need of the hour to eradicate poverty , can we not overcome poverty ?'
p1353
aS'can we not defeat poverty ?'
p1354
aS'my 125 crore dear countrymen , let us resolve to eradicate poverty , to win against it .'
p1355
aS'let us move with the dream of poverty eradication from india .'
p1356
aS'our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same problem .'
p1357
aS'why not get together with all the saarc nations to plan out the fight against poverty ?'
p1358
aS'lets fight together and defeat poverty .'
p1359
aS'let us see at-least for once as to how wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of killing and getting killed .'
p1360
aS'this is the land where incidents from siddharths life happened .'
p1361
aS'one bird was shot with an arrow by one brother and the other took out that arrow to save it .'
p1362
aS'they went to mother- whose bird , whose swan ?'
p1363
aS'whether killers or saviours , they asked of mother .'
p1364
aS'the mother replied , saviours .'
p1365
aS'the saviour has more power than the killer and that makes him buddha in future .'
p1366
aS'and thats why i seek cooperation from neighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert and cooperate with them , so that together with saarc countries we can create our importance and emerge as a power in the world .'
p1367
aS'it is imperative that we work together with a dream to win a fight against poverty , shoulder to shoulder .'
p1368
aS'i went to bhutan , nepal , all the dignitaries from saarc countries took part in oath-taking ceremony ; this marked a good beginning .'
p1369
aS'this will definitely yield good results , it is my belief and this thinking of india , in the country and the world , that we want to do well to the countrymen and be useful for the welfare of the world , india wants such a hand to be extended .'
p1370
aS'we are trying to move forward with these dreams to achieve them .'

p1373
aS'if you work for 14 hours , i will do for 15 hours .'
p1374
aS'why ?'
p1375
aS'because im amidst you not as a prime minister , but as the first servant .'
p1376
aS'i have formed the government not as a ruler , but as a servant .'
p1377
aS'brothers and sisters , i assure that this country has a destiny .'
p1378
aS'it is destined to work for the welfare of the world , it was said by vivekanand ji .'
p1379
aS'india is born , this hindustan is born in order to achieve this destiny .'
p1380
aS'one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen have to move forward wholeheartedly for the welfare of the nation .'

aa(lp1388
S'my dear students and friends from the different schools all over the country and those present in this function .'
p1389
aS'this is a moment of great happiness for me that i have got an opportunity to interact with children who are carrying dreams of future india in their eyes .'
p1390
aS'today is teachers day .'
p1391
aS'gradually this inspiring chapter is losing its importance , perhaps there would be many schools where 5th september is not remembered in this form .'
p1392
aS'this has become limited to giving awards to teacher and having ceremonies .'
p1393
aS'need of the hour is to underline the importance of a teacher in our social life .'
p1394
aS'till the time we dont accept this importance neither will we feel the honour for a teacher nor be successful in changing the new generation through the medium of teachers .'
p1395
aS'that is why there is a need to update this great tradition and reenergise it .'
p1396
aS'there is a need for debate on the reasons why many bright students do not want to become teachers .'
p1397
aS'all of us have to find the answer to this question .'
p1398
aS'in a global context , it is believed that there is a great demand for teachers and good teachers are in short supply .'
p1399
aS'india is a young nation .'
p1400
aS'cant india dream of exporting teachers of high calibre ?'
p1401
aS'cant we instil this desire in the heart of todays children that i will become a great teacher and will contribute in the progress of my country ?'
p1402
aS'how to rekindle this feeling .'
p1403
aS'dr.'
p1404
aS'sarvapalli radhakrishnan has done a great service to this country .'
p1405
aS'he never used to celebrate his birthday as he insisted that the birthday of a teacher should be observed .'
p1406
aS'this concept of teachers day is now prevalent in many countries .'
p1407
aS'ask any great person in the world about the success in the life he or she will definitely tell two things .'
p1408
aS'first this is my mothers contribution and second , my teachers contribution .'
p1409
aS'we get to hear this from about almost every great personalities .'
p1410
aS'but it holds importance only to the point till we follow it diligently .'
p1411
aS'there was a time when this feeling was there for a teacher .'
p1412
aS'if there was one most respected figure in the entire village , it was the teacher .'
p1413
aS'his word was final .'
p1414
aS'gradually this situation has changed considerably .'
p1415
aS'however , we can establish it once again .'
p1416
aS'as a child , you might be having many questions .'
p1417
aS'many of you must be finding difficult to enjoy holidays and will be eagerly waiting for monday so that you can go and tell the teacher what all was done on sunday .'
p1418
aS'things which cant be told to mother , brother and sister , one feels so eager to tell ones teacher .'
p1419
aS'this is the level of closeness .'
p1420
aS'the same teacher changes his/her life .'
p1421
aS'teachers word brings the major change in the life of a student .'
p1422
aS'i know of many students who talk like their teache , dress like their teacher , he is their hero .'
p1423
aS'this is a stage which needs to be enlivened to strengthen our new genearation .'
p1424
aS'there is a saying in china that those who think only for a year , they sow foodgrains , those who thinks for a decade , they plant fruits .'
p1425
aS'but those who thinks for generations , they prepare humans .'
p1426
aS'it means to educate , to imbibe culture and to prepare someone for life .'
p1427
aS'how can we make our education system come alive with a zeal for life building .'
p1428
aS'i have said on 15th august that i want no school should remain without toilet for girls by the end of this year .'
p1429
aS'a number of schools do not have toilets for girls .'
p1430
aS'some schools do not have toilets even for boys .'
p1431
aS'many may feel that this job is not worthy of a prime minister .'
p1432
aS'but when i went into details , i found that this is a highly important job .'
p1433
aS'however , for this i need help from every school of the country and all the teachers who are listening , for creating an enabling environment for this .'
p1434
aS'i was there in japan couple of days ago .'
p1435
aS'an indian family met me , the wife was japanese and the husband who was indian came to me and said that i heard your independence day speech .'
p1436
aS'you are insisting on cleanliness .'
p1437
aS'there is a rule here in japan that all of us , teachers and the students , together clean the school .'
p1438
aS'even the toilets are cleaned collectively .'
p1439
aS'this is part of our character building in our school .'
p1440
aS'why is it not so in india ?'
p1441
aS'i said that i have to go back and ask mediapeople , otherwise it will run for 24 hours .'
p1442
aS'once , when i was in gujarat , there was a programme on tv that was running that school children were cleaning the school .'
p1443
aS'what kind of a school was that , what type of management was this , what teachers , exploitation of children !'
p1444
aS'anyway , i made light of that event .'
p1445
aS'however , how will we make this a national trait .'
p1446
aS'this can happen .'
p1447
aS'i call upon the senior people of the country .'
p1448
aS'you may be doctors , lawyers , ias officers or ips officers .'
p1449
aS'cant you identify a school nearby and volunteer to teach there for at least one period after deciding appropriate subject with the school .'
p1450
aS'if every educated indian volunteer for one period of teaching every week .'
p1451
aS'howsoever senior an officer , why cant he or she can spend some time once in a week with children and teach them something .'
p1452
aS'please tell me if we agree that there are problems in the education system like lack of good teachers etc , cant this be rectified .'
p1453
aS'why cant we convert nation-building into a peoples movement ?'
p1454
aS'we should align everybodys strength .'
p1455
aS'we are not a country that should be left behind .'
p1456
aS'we can go ahead a great deal .'
p1457
aS'for this our emphasis should be on national character building .'
p1458
aS'there should be collective efforts and this can be done .'
p1459
aS'as a student you might be having many dreams .'
p1460
aS'i dont believe that situations in life can stop anyone .'
p1461
aS'if the determination is strong , then i believe that youngsters and children of this country have the strength and talent to move forward .'
p1462
aS'importance of technology is increasing day by day .'
p1463
aS'i will request all the teachers that if something is needed to be learnt , it should be learnt .'
p1464
aS'we should keep on learning irrespective of our age being 40 , 45 or 50 .'
p1465
aS'we are living with children who are growing in the age of technology .'
p1466
aS'we should not keep them deprived from this .'
p1467
aS'that will be a social crime .'
p1468
aS'our efforts should be that our children should be well versed with modern science and technology .'
p1469
aS'the child should get ample opportunity to know the world in this form .'
p1470
aS'this should be our effort .'
p1471
aS'sometimes i ask this from children .'
p1472
aS'i want to ask you also a question , will you reply ?'
p1473
aS'how many children sweat profusely four times in a day ?'
p1474
aS'how many ?'
p1475
aS'there is no one ?'
p1476
aS'if there is no sports in life , child will not bloom .'
p1477
aS'this is a stage one should enjoy and spare time to sweat at least four times in a day .'
p1478
aS'will you do that ?'
p1479
aS'are you sure ?'
p1480
aS'your life should not be burdened with tv , books and computer .'
p1481
aS'life is also beyond these .'
p1482
aS'we must have enjoyment in our lives .'
p1483
aS'how many of you have hobby of reading books outside your curriculum ?'
p1484
aS'it seems there is a good number of such children .'
p1485
aS'how many of you like to read autobiographies .'
p1486
aS'it seems there are very few such children .'
p1487
aS'i ask children to read biography of the person whom they like most .'
p1488
aS'by reading biography we come closer to the history .'
p1489
aS'we know the contemporary history by reading about the life of a person .'
p1490
aS'it is not necessary that we should read a particular type of biography only .'
p1491
aS'if someone wants to advance in sports he should read biography of the person from that field .'
p1492
aS'if someone has done well in cinema and you get the chance to read his biography , you must read .'
p1493
aS'if someone has done well in the field of business his biography should be read .'
p1494
aS'it someone has worked as scientist his autobiography should be read .'
p1495
aS'by reading biography we get the chance to come closer to the history and to understand what truth is .'
p1496
aS'we should strive for that .'
p1497
aS'otherwise , everything is done by google guru and you have the habit to go to google if you have a question .'
p1498
aS'one gets the information but not the knowledge .'
p1499
aS'i have been told some students have questions , i would like to chat with them .'
p1500
aS'make the atmosphere lighter , there is no need to remain serious .'
p1501
aS'your teacher might have told you not to put your hand in this manner , dont do this .'
p1502
aS'have they told ?'
p1503
aS'you must follow instructions of your teacher but after leaving this place .'
p1504
aS'right now , be relaxed , then we will talk .'
p1505
aS'again , i want to give you my best wishes .'
p1506
aS'on the teachers day i salute all the teachers and give them my best wishes .'
p1507
aS'teachers have played a big role in building lives of many like us .'
p1508
aS'i feel indebted for that .'

S'following is the english rendering of the text of prime minister , shri narendra modi at the launch of swachhata mission , here today .'
p1725
aS'bharat mata ki jai , long live mahatma gandhi , long live lal bahadur shastri .'
p1726
aS'my colleagues from central government , shri venkaiah naidu ji and shri nitin gadkari ji , dignitaries and my young friends .'
p1727
aS'today is 2nd october , birth anniversaries of our pujya mahatma gandhi and lal bahadur shashtri ji .'
p1728
aS'lal bahadur shastri gave us the mantra of jai jawan jai kisan .'
p1729
aS'indian farmers filled the granaries in reply to that exhortation .'
p1730
aS'pujya bapu gave us the message of quit india- clean india .'
p1731
aS'our countrymen , under the leadership of mahatma gandhi , freed the nation from colonialism .'
p1732
aS'bapus dream of cleanliness , however , remains unfulfilled .'
p1733
aS'here , we had called for a logo and an idea through crowd-sourcing , asked the people for a tagline .'
p1734
aS'bhai anant of maharashtra and sister bhagyashri won the contest .'
p1735
aS'it was right to the point .'
p1736
aS'i can see , that through these glasses gandhiji is looking and asking whether we have cleaned india or not .'
p1737
aS'this is not just a logo .'
p1738
aS'through these glasses he is looking , asking- what have you done ?'
p1739
aS'what will you do and how ?'
p1740
aS'by when will you do it ?'
p1741
aS'this is the message of the logo that has mahatma gandhis glasses .'
p1742
aS'they give us the message of clean india .'
p1743
aS'i compliment the creator of this logo- shri anant .'
p1744
aS'one tag line has been given by bhagyashri- one step towards cleanliness .'
p1745
aS'not a big deal , just a step .'
p1746
aS'for this i complement bhagyashri .'
p1747
aS'my dear countrymen , today from this platform with all the authenticity , and purity at my command , india gate is right in front of me where flame of our martyrs is burning , i swear by that , i am not making a political statement .'
p1748
aS'all governments of this country must have done their bit for this cause .'
p1749
aS'many social , cultural and religious leaders must have contributed towards this task .'
p1750
aS'there may have been different people , different forms of programme , i salute all of them .'
p1751
aS'i have to take this series forward .'
p1752
aS'i dont make any claim that the new government is doing everything .'
p1753
aS'i acknowledged all previous governments from the red fort also .'
p1754
aS'today , from this august platform i convey my respect to all governments whether of centre or of state , municipal bodies , social organizations , sarvodaya leaders , seva dal workers .'
p1755
aS'as this holy mission is starting today , i salute every one of them and pray to all countrymen to start this programme .'
p1756
aS'sometimes i feel that the job of getting rid of filth belongs to safai karmchari only ?'
p1757
aS'isnt it the duty of all the 125 crore countrymen ?'
p1758
aS'will we keep on imposing everything on them only ?'
p1759
aS'something good happens or bad , will be keep on blaming them only ?'
p1760
aS'we have to change this situation .'
p1761
aS'like all 125 crore indians the prime minister is also first son of bharat mata and prime minister later .'
p1762
aS'therefore , as the children of this mother , all of us are responsible that we should not keep our country like this .'
p1763
aS'it may be village neighborhood , home family , school and college , mandir , masjid or gurudwara ; how can we keep it dirty ?'
p1764
aS'wherever we see filth or see someone throwing papers why dont we feel like picking that up ?'
p1765
aS'i know this will not be accomplished only by publicity campaign .'
p1766
aS'old habits take time to change .'
p1767
aS'its a difficult task , i know .'
p1768
aS'but we have till 2019 when we will observe 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi .'
p1769
aS'i am grateful to my media friends who are spreading this message .'
p1770
aS'if we collectively make it a peoples movement then i dont see any reason why we will not be counted among the clean cities and nations of the world .'
p1771
aS'india can also do it , indians can do it .'
p1772
aS'if indians can reach mars with minimum expense then cant they clean their neighborhood ?'
p1773
aS'no prime minister or minister took us to mars .'
p1774
aS'it was done by the scientists ; children of mother india .'
p1775
aS'cleanliness will also be achieved together .'
p1776
aS'i know , in coming days i will be criticized .'
p1777
aS'look what has been achieved ?'
p1778
aS'i understand lot of criticism will come my way .'
p1779
aS'however , i am ready to face all the criticism for making mother india pristine once again .'
p1780
aS'i have come with the determination that 125 crore indians will not let mother india remain dirty .'
p1781
aS'we will not leave any stone unturned to fulfill bapus dreams .'
p1782
aS'i have decided to start a movement in social media also .'
p1783
aS'it is there on mygov .'
p1784
aS'in website also .'
p1785
aS'a new website has been created on clean india .'
p1786
aS'work has been started on facebook and twitter also .'
p1787
aS'# mycleanindia was started today .'
p1788
aS'i appeal all the countrymen to upload photographs of garbage , then clean that and upload the video and the photographs of the cleaned place .'
p1789
aS'i also appeal to media .'
p1790
aS'there are many youngsters , organizations in every nook and corner of the country .'
p1791
aS'they are doing the work of cleanliness way before i became the prime minister .'
p1792
aS'they should be brought to the limelight by media .'
p1793
aS'all common people who work for cleanliness should be highlighted .'
p1794
aS'all of us should create an inspiring environment .'
p1795
aS'finger pointing will not help as i told earlier this is beyond politics .'
p1796
aS'this is a work solely inspired by patriotism .'
p1797
aS'we will do it with patriotic feeling .'
p1798
aS'there is no place for politics .'
p1799
aS'that is why i say there are many organizations and social and cultural bodies those who are working in their own way .'
p1800
aS'i have seen many villages where sarpanch is so alert and villagers keep the village in exemplary cleanliness .'
p1801
aS'many people are like that .'
p1802
aS'some of the teachers take lot of interest in keeping the premises clean , the atmosphere is kept very pure .'
p1803
aS'when we come to india gate and go towards rashtrapati bhawan it feels nice to see the clean surroundings .'
p1804
aS'should not every corner of india be this clean ?'
p1805
aS'isnt this our social duty ?'
p1806
aS'we will do a great disservice by treating it politically or considering it a photo opportunity .'
p1807
aS'mahatma gandhi did not go to every locality to clean up but his commitment created awareness towards cleanliness in entire india .'
p1808
aS'we also have to do it together .'
p1809
aS'wherever we are , we should do it .'
p1810
aS'i believe we will be able to clean our mother india .'
p1811
aS'this is a work for 125 crore indians .'
p1812
aS'in those 125 crore indians there is a person called modi .'
p1813
aS'not that modi is alone but there are 125 crore indians and i am saying it 125 crore times .'
p1814
aS'this work is not only for government or for ministers , neither is this work only of social organizations and devoted social workers .'
p1815
aS'this is a mass movement .'
p1816
aS'the more we associate this with common person , the more are the chances of success .'
p1817
aS'today navarati is coming to an end .'
p1818
aS'tomorrow we will celebrate vijayadashmi .'
p1819
aS'i convey my best wishes to all countrymen for vijayadashmi tomorrow .'
p1820
aS'today , i have started a programme on social media .'
p1821
aS'i have invited 9 people to come to public place and work for cleanliness .'
p1822
aS'i am sure that those 9 people whom i have invited will surely do this work .'
p1823
aS'not only this , i have requested them that they should also invite 9 other people .'
p1824
aS'then 9 more .'
p1825
aS'i request you also that you also upload videos of your cleanliness projects and this chain of 9 should carry on .'
p1826
aS'today , i have invited goa governor honble mridula sinha , bharat ratna sachin tendulkar , yoga guru baba ramdev , congress leader shri shashi tharoor jee , shriman kamal hasan , shriman salman khan , sister priyanka chopra and the entire team of tarak mehta ka ulta chashma .'
p1827
aS'i have told them to push this through their and other serials .'
p1828
aS'our film industry will also see , in last fifty years there have been many movies where they were episodes related to cleanliness .'
p1829
aS'we need to encourage this and do our duty .'
p1830
aS'brothers and sisters there is a startling evaluation of who they say that the diseases created by lack of cleanliness results in additional loss of 6500 rupees to every indian .'
p1831
aS'due to illness someone is not able to drive taxi or auto rickshaw or not able to distribute newspapers or not able to deliver milk .'
p1832
aS'this is just the average of the total loss .'
p1833
aS'if we take out affluent households then burden on poor people will go up to 12-15 thousand .'
p1834
aS'if we just spread cleanliness , our poor will be saved 6500 rupees .'
p1835
aS'this will save him from diseases and unemployment .'
p1836
aS'this movement is very important for the health of the poor .'
p1837
aS'serving mother india is serving the poorest .'
p1838
aS'come lets see on mygov .'
p1839
aS'in , my facebook or twitter , the mood that i am witnessing , the enthusiasm that i see , fills me with hope that public is ready to move hundred steps ahead of the government .'
p1840
aS'if public is moving there is no reason to stop them .'
p1841
aS'brothers and sisters , we should gift something to mahatma gandhi .'
p1842
aS'in 2019 when gandhiji will turn 150 , we should gift him a swachh bharat created with a collective responsibility .'
p1843
aS'quit india was successful due to the involvement of everyone in the freedom struggle .'
p1844
aS'success of clean india lies in the involvement of 125 crore indians .'
p1845
aS'jai jawan , jai kisan was successful as it was given by lal bahadur shastri .'
p1846
aS'he called for agricultural production .'
p1847
aS'nobody asked lal bahadur shastri that , are you going to the fields to plough them , have you done some farming or produced some foodgrain ?'
p1848
aS'nobody asked anything .'
p1849
aS'but as lal bahadur shastri said jai kisan- all the farmers stood up and filled the granaries .'
p1850
aS'the momentous tasks of giving food to every poor in india was done on the words of this great man .'
p1851
aS'now , this is the time to realise mahatma gandhis words .'
p1852
aS'just look at the purity of this great mans words , its power , its dedication : shouldnt this inspire us ?'
p1853
aS'whether it is me or you , success of clean india will give us the same pleasure as the success of quit india slogan .'
p1854
aS'it will give us similar joy and prosperity .'
p1855
aS'we have started moving ahead with our faith in the words of these great men .'
p1856
aS'dont put your trust on me or my government , trust mahatma gandhi .'
p1857
aS'trust his sacrifice , determination and dedication .'
p1858
aS'believe in his dream of swachh bharat .'
p1859
aS'today this is our responsibility that if we are the children of mother india we should not either cause filth or allow other to do it .'
p1860
aS'often when we go to foreign countries , we say how clean it was there , there was no dirt anywhere .'
p1861
aS'then i ask these people , did you like the fact that it was so clean ?'
p1862
aS'then i ask , did you see anyone littering or spitting ?'
p1863
aS'they say , no we didnt .'
p1864
aS'then i say that the secret of cleanliness is in the discipline of their citizens .'
p1865
aS'if we manage that , i am sure we will do wonders .'
p1866
aS'one more work is there that of building toilets .'
p1867
aS'in our villages more than sixty percent people are still going to toilet in open .'
p1868
aS'i feel most pained that even our mothers and sisters have to go in open .'
p1869
aS'we have to remove this blot .'
p1870
aS'i have told corporate social responsibility people to prioritize this .'
p1871
aS'we should do this much at least for the dignity of our mothers and sisters .'
p1872
aS'even today , there are many schools which dont have separate toilets for girls .'
p1873
aS'we need to change this .'
p1874
aS'it is nobodys fault ; we just need to move ahead with a positive outlook of future .'
p1875
aS'there should not be any political comment by any member of this movement as everybody has work .'
p1876
aS'every one before us also worked .'
p1877
aS'under mahatma gandhi , congress was at the forefront of it .'
p1878
aS'i worship this work , that is why i request specially to media and countrymen with folded hands that , associate this movement only with love for the country .'
p1879
aS'link this movement only with the worship of mother india and with the poor and health of the poor .'
p1880
aS'we should not vitiate the environment by talking about , who is doing who is not , who was successful , who was not .'
p1881
aS'we should move with a sense of collective responsibility .'
p1882
aS'with collective responsibility we will surely be successful .'
p1883
aS'now i invite every one of you .'
p1884
aS'we are going to take an oath here .'
p1885
aS'my request is that those who are sitting should take oath sitting , no need to stand up .'
p1886
aS'those who are standing should keep on standing .'
p1887
aS'my second request is that you should raise both of your hands and remember mahatma gandhi .'
p1888
aS'feel that this work is for building a bharat of the dreams of pujya bapu .'
p1889
aS'we should not just utter the words but take solemn pledge .'
p1890
aS'you will take the pledge , take the movement forward and will leave no stone unturned .'
p1891
aS'mahatma gandhi dreamt of an india which was not only free but also clean and developed .'
p1892
aS'mahatma gandhi secured freedom for mother india .'
p1893
aS'now it is our duty to serve mother india by keeping the country neat and clean .'
p1894
aS'i take this pledge that i will remain committed towards cleanliness and devote time for this .'
p1895
aS'i will devote 100 hours per year that is two hours per week to voluntary work for cleanliness .'
p1896
aS'i will neither litter nor let others litter .'
p1897
aS'i will initiate the quest for cleanliness with myself , my family , my locality , my village and my work place .'
p1898
aS'i believe that the countries of the world that appear clean are so because their citizens dont indulge in littering nor do they allow it to happen .'
p1899
aS'with this firms belief , i will propagate the message of swachh bharat mission in villages and towns .'
p1900
aS'i will encourage 100 other persons to take this pledge which i am taking today .'
p1901
aS'i will endeavour to make them devote their 100 hours for cleanliness .'
p1902
aS'i am confident that every step i take towards cleanliness will help in making my country clean .'

S'my dear countrymen , today is the holy festival of vijay dashami .'
p1907
aS'my heartiest greetings on this occasion of vijay dashami to one and all .'
p1908
aS'through the medium of radio , i would like to share few heartfelt thoughts with you today .'
p1909
aS'and , i hope that not only today , this series of conversation may be carried out regularly in future .'
p1910
aS'i will try my best , if possible , to take out time twice a month or even once to speak with you .'
p1911
aS'in future , i have also decided that whenever i will speak to you , it would be on sundays and time would be morning 11 .'
p1912
aS'in that way , it would be convenient for you too and i will feel contented with the fact that i am successful in sharing my thoughts with you .'
p1913
aS'we are celebrating the festival of vijay dashami today , which symbolises the triumph of good over evil .'
p1914
aS'but one gentleman named ganesh venkatadari , a native of mumbai , sent me a mail and has written to me that we must take a vow to eliminate ten bad habits from within ourselves on this occasion of vijay dashami .'
p1915
aS'i express my gratitude to him for this recommendation .'
p1916
aS'we all , as individuals , must be thinking to put an end to all our bad habits and win over them , although , with respect to our nation , i believe we all should come together and take a vow in eliminating all the dirt from our country .'
p1917
aS'on this occasion of vijay dashami , we must take a vow to eliminate dirt and filth and we can do so on this occasion .'
p1918
aS'yesterday , on 2nd october on the eve of mahatma gandhis birth anniversary , more than 1.'
p1919
aS'25 crore countrymen have started the swachh bharat movement .'
p1920
aS'i had shared one thought yesterday which is that i will nominate nine people and they need to upload their videos of cleaning the nation on social media websites , and nominating nine more people to do the same .'
p1921
aS'i want you all to join me , clean the nation , and nominate nine more people to clean the nation , and those nine people must do the same .'
p1922
aS'eventually , the entire nation will have this atmosphere .'
p1923
aS'i strongly believe that you all will join hands with me to carry this movement forward .'
p1924
aS'whenever , we think of mahatma gandhi , naturally we are reminded of khaadi .'
p1925
aS'you may be wearing variety of clothes with different fabrics and company brands in your family .'
p1926
aS'but is it not possible to include khaadi too ?'
p1927
aS'i am not telling you to use only khaadi products .'
p1928
aS'i am just insisting to use , at least one khaadi product , like handkerchief , or a bath towel , a bed sheet , a pillow cover , a curtain or anything of that kind .'
p1929
aS'if you have an inclination for all kinds of fabrics and clothes in your family , you can also buy khaadi products on a regular basis .'
p1930
aS'i am saying this as when you buy khaadi products , it helps poor people to light lamps on diwali .'
p1931
aS'also , you can avail a special discount on khaadi products from 2nd october for a month .'
p1932
aS'it is a very small thing , but has very big impact which binds you with the poor .'
p1933
aS'how you see this as a success .'
p1934
aS'when i speak of 1.'
p1935
aS'25 crore countrymen and infer the outcome , we might assume that government will take care of everything and as individuals we stand nowhere .'
p1936
aS'we have seen that if we intend to progress then we need to identify our potential , understand our strengths and i can swear that we form the incomparable souls of this world .'
p1937
aS'you all know that our own scientists have been successful in reaching mars , bearing least expenses .'
p1938
aS'we do not lack in our strengths , but have forgotten our strong points .'
p1939
aS'we have forgotten ourselves .'
p1940
aS'we have become hopeless .'
p1941
aS'my dear brothers and sisters i can not let this happen .'
p1942
aS'i always remember one of the sayings by swami vivekananda ji as he always used to emphasize on one thought and possibly , he might have shared this thought with many others .'
p1943
aS'vivekananda ii used to say , once a lioness was carrying her two cubs on the way and came upon a flock of sheep from a distance .'
p1944
aS'she got a desire to prey upon them and started running towards the flock .'
p1945
aS'seeing her running , one of the cub too , joined her .'
p1946
aS'the other cub was left behind and the lioness moved on , post preying upon the flock .'
p1947
aS'one of the cub went with the lioness but the other cub was left behind , and was brought up by a mother sheep .'
p1948
aS'he grew among the sheep , started speaking their language and adapted their ways of life .'
p1949
aS'he used to sit , laugh and enjoy with them .'
p1950
aS'the cub who went with the lioness , was a grown-up now .'
p1951
aS'once , he happened to meet his brother and was shocked to see him .'
p1952
aS'he thought in his mind , he is a lion and is playing with sheep , talking like sheep .'
p1953
aS'what is wrong with him ?'
p1954
aS'he felt that his ego was at stake and went to talk to his brother .'
p1955
aS'he said , what are you doing , brother ?'
p1956
aS'you are a lion .'
p1957
aS'he gets a reply from his brother , no , i am a sheep .'
p1958
aS'i grew up with them .'
p1959
aS'they have brought me up .'
p1960
aS'listen to my voice and the way i talk .'
p1961
aS'he said , come , i will show you , who you really are .'
p1962
aS'he took his brother to a well and told him to look in the water his own reflection , and asked him , if both of them had similar faces .'
p1963
aS'i am a lion , you , too , are a lion .'
p1964
aS'his brothers self-esteem got awakened ; he attained self-realization through this and even a lion brought up among sheep started roaring like a lion .'
p1965
aS'his inner entity was awakened .'
p1966
aS'swami vivekananda ji used to say the same .'
p1967
aS'my countrymen , 125 crore indians have indefinite strengths and capabilities .'
p1968
aS'we need to understand ourselves .'
p1969
aS'we need to identify our inner strengths and like swami ji always used to say , we need to carry our self-respect , identify ourselves and move forward in life and be successful , which in turn , make our nation a winning and successful country .'
p1970
aS'i believe , all our countrymen with a population of 125 crores are efficient , strong and can stand against any odds with confidence .'
p1971
aS'these days , i have been getting many letters through social media websites , like facebook , from my friends .'
p1972
aS'one of them , mr gautam pal , has addressed an issue regarding the specially-abled children .'
p1973
aS'he has suggested forming separate municipality , municipal corporation or councils for them .'
p1974
aS'we need to plan something for them for enhancing their moral support .'
p1975
aS'i liked his suggestion and i have experienced this during my day as chief minister of gujarat .'
p1976
aS'a special olympics was held in athens in 2011 .'
p1977
aS'after the olympics i had called all the participants and winners of specially-abled category from gujarat to my home .'
p1978
aS'i spent two hours with them , and it was the most emotional and inspiring incident of my life .'
p1979
aS'as i believe , a specially-abled child is not only the responsibility of the parents in a family , it is the responsibility of the entire society .'
p1980
aS'god has chosen this family to support a specially-abled child , but a child is a responsibility of the entire nation .'
p1981
aS'after this incident , i got so emotionally attached with them , i started organizing separate olympics for them in gujarat .'
p1982
aS'thousands of children with their parents used to come and attend , i , too , used to attend the olympics .'
p1983
aS'there was an atmosphere of trust and , this is the reason , i liked the suggestion given by mr gautam pal and i felt like sharing this thought with you .'
p1984
aS'it reminds me of another story .'
p1985
aS'once , a traveller was sitting at the corner of a road , and was asking everyone the way to a specific place .'
p1986
aS'he continued asking the route from many people .'
p1987
aS'a man , sitting beside him was observing him .'
p1988
aS'the traveller stood up and started asking passers-by again .'
p1989
aS'he stood up and said , the way to your destination is here .'
p1990
aS'the traveller , then , said , brother , you were sitting next to me for so long , saw me asking everyone the route .'
p1991
aS'if you knew the route , why didnt you tell me before ?'
p1992
aS'the man answered , i was waiting to verify if you really intend to reach your destination or you are asking people just for your knowledge .'
p1993
aS'but , when you stood up , i was assured that you truly wish to reach your destination , and decided to confirm the address .'
p1994
aS'my countrymen , till the time we do not decide to walk , stand on our own , we will also not the get the guidance from others in our journey .'
p1995
aS'we will not get the people to hold our hand and help us in walking .'
p1996
aS'we need to take the initiative in walking and i trust all my 125 crore indians , who are capable of walking on their own and will keep moving .'
p1997
aS'for the past few days , i have been getting very interesting suggestions from people .'
p1998
aS'i am aware , when to adapt to these suggestions .'
p1999
aS'but , i want everyone to actively participate in these suggestions as we all belong to our nation , the nation does not only belong to any government .'
p2000
aS'we are the citizens of our nation and we all need to unite without any exceptions .'
p2001
aS'some of you have suggested simplifying the registration process for small scale industries .'
p2002
aS'i will definitely put this under governments notice .'
p2003
aS'some of you have written to me to incorporate skills development courses in the school curriculum from 5th standard .'
p2004
aS'this will help the students to learn various skills and crafts .'
p2005
aS'i loved this effective suggestion given by them .'
p2006
aS'they have also suggested that even the adults should learn skills development courses along with their studies .'
p2007
aS'one of the suggestions given was to keep a dustbin at every 100 meters and a cleaning system should be established .'
p2008
aS'some of you have written to me , to abolish the use of plastic bags .'
p2009
aS'i am receiving numerous suggestions from people .'
p2010
aS'i have always been telling you , to write to me and narrate a true incident , which is positive and inspiring to me and our countrymen , along with the evidence .'
p2011
aS'if you do this , i can promise this to you , that i will share all those heartfelt thoughts or suggestions with all our countrymen , through mann ki baat .'
p2012
aS'i have only one intention in speaking with you all , come , let us serve our mother india .'
p2013
aS'let us all take our nation to the new heights .'
p2014
aS'let us all take a step forward .'
p2015
aS'if you take one step , our nation takes 125 crore steps to move forward , and for this purpose , on this auspicious occasion of vijay dashami , we all need to defeat all of our inner evils and decide to start doing something good for the nation .'
p2016
aS'today is the fortunate beginning for me .'
p2017
aS'i will be sharing my heartfelt thoughts with one and all .'
p2018
aS'today , i have shared all the thoughts coming directly from my heart .'
p2019
aS'i will meet you all next at 11 am on sundays , but i trust our journey shall never end and will continue receiving love and suggestions from you .'
p2020
aS'after listening to my thoughts , please do not hesitate in sharing your thoughts or advice to me , i will appreciate that your suggestions keep coming .'
p2021
aS'i am glad to talk with you through this simple medium of radio , which serves each and every corner of the nation .'
p2022
aS'i can reach the poorest homes , as mine , my nations strength lies within the hut of poor , within the villages ; my nations strength lies with the mothers , sisters and youths ; my nations strength lies with the farmers .'
p2023
aS'nation will only progress , if you believe in it .'
p2024
aS'i am expressing my trust towards the nation .'
p2025
aS'i believe in your strength , hence , i believe in our nations future .'
p2026
aS'i would once again , like to thank one and all for taking out time and listening to me .'
p2027
aS'thank you all .'
p2028
aa(lp2029
S'all the governments that have come to power in india since independence have been working for rural development in their own ways .'
p2030
aS'these efforts should continue relentlessly while adapting with time .'
p2031
aS'plans should be made according to changing times and the speed of change should gain pace in accordance with the pace of the world .'
p2032
aS'this is an ever-continuing process .'
p2033
aS'however it is important to introduce some new elements each time to speed up and enliven this process .'
p2034
aS'every state of india has at least 5 to 10 villages that it can be proud of .'
p2035
aS'there is a different feeling when we enter such villages .'
p2036
aS'if government planning creates these villages , then there should have been more of such villages .'
p2037
aS'since there are only a few , it means there is something extra , apart from government plans .'
p2038
aS'this something extra is the soul of saansad adarsh gram yojana .'
p2039
aS'plans exist for all villages , but some villages progressed as there were some people in those villages with a different thought process .'
p2040
aS'some leaders who led differently to bring about these changes .'
p2041
aS'it is not that there are no other better villages .'
p2042
aS'there are .'
p2043
aS'and they have been built by our people only .'
p2044
aS'need of the hour is to bring some changes in the decision making process and the beginning has to be made somewhere .'
p2045
aS'today is the birth anniversary of jayaprakash narayan ji , a vibrant young force of freedom struggle .'
p2046
aS'the way he led his life after independence keeping away from politics and dedicating himself to creative work alone , is a source of inspiration for all of us .'
p2047
aS'there was always a shadow of gandhiji and vinobaji on his thoughts .'
p2048
aS'lohiaji was also an influence .'
p2049
aS'he said that gram dharma is an important thing and till the time our villages dont think or move as a society , gram dharma is not possible .'
p2050
aS'and if gram dharma is possible then the village can choose its path to new heights .'
p2051
aS'the village was always present in mahatma gandhis life .'
p2052
aS'gandhi ji returned from abroad in 1915 .'
p2053
aS'within two years he implemented what he had learnt in champaran , bihar , where he fought for the rights of people .'
p2054
aS'it was done with peoples participation .'
p2055
aS'the seeds of freedom struggle were sowed by gandhi ji in villages only .'
p2056
aS'today is also the birth anniversary of shri nanaji deshmukh - a close comrade of jai prakash narayan ji .'
p2057
aS'nanaji dedicated himself to the development of jaiprabha nagar near chitrakoot , which was named after jai prakash narayan and his wife prabha devi .'
p2058
aS'based on the model of jaiprabha nagar , he worked to make rural life self-sufficient in many villages of uttar pradesh .'
p2059
aS'our former president abdul kalam ji visited these villages and mentioned them in many of his speeches .'
p2060
aS'the point is , today we have to take the adarsh gram yojana forward with our mps guidance , mps leadership and mps efforts .'
p2061
aS'for the time being , we have thought of a total of three villages in this term .'
p2062
aS'one model village should be achieved by 2016 and based on that experience , two more model villages are to be achieved by 2019 .'
p2063
aS'later , every year , one village can be done by a mp .'
p2064
aS'we are almost 800 mps and if we do three villages before 2019 then 2,500 villages will be covered .'
p2065
aS'if the states also make schemes for their mlas based on this scheme , then six-seven thousand more villages can be added .'
p2066
aS'if a village in a block improves then it doesnt stop there .'
p2067
aS'it is adopted by nearby villages also .'
p2068
aS'they also discuss what is being done and how it can be replicated .'
p2069
aS'this can initiate a viral effect .'
p2070
aS'that is why it is important how we lay its foundation .'
p2071
aS'for a long time this debate has been going on in the country about whether development model should be top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top .'
p2072
aS'let the discussion go on .'
p2073
aS'academic discussions have their own importance .'
p2074
aS'but the responsibility of doers is to do .'
p2075
aS'we need to start somewhere .'
p2076
aS'so let us sit at the bottom and look at one village in our constituency at least .'
p2077
aS'many people dont understand the biggest benefit from this .'
p2078
aS'today an mp is engaged in tackling problems of the public in his constituency .'
p2079
aS'irrespective of the party , the mp is accountable and has to perform .'
p2080
aS'however most of his or her time and energy is spent in immediate problems .'
p2081
aS'secondly , his/her energy and time is spent in getting work done from the government and officers .'
p2082
aS'i cant say whether i will be able to change this .'
p2083
aS'what happens to mplads funds ?'
p2084
aS'constituency people demand this or that .'
p2085
aS'then it is distributed , given to government officers with an instruction that it should please most of the village .'
p2086
aS'only small schemes are undertaken ultimately .'
p2087
aS'this is the kind of work which , with focused activities , can make the mp feel that his / her name will be associated with the village for years to come .'
p2088
aS'the village always remember that earlier the village was like this , and one mp came and changed all that .'
p2089
aS'today , there are many government schemes .'
p2090
aS'an mp might be coming in touch with these schemes only in parts .'
p2091
aS'what is the problem in uniting the streams of these different schemes ?'
p2092
aS'what are the shortcomings and what are the ways to improve ?'
p2093
aS'once an mp starts discussing this in the village , many deficiencies of government system will be revealed .'
p2094
aS'it is not a small risk that i have taken here .'
p2095
aS'however , on the basis of my knowledge and experience , i can say that once an mp is associated with this , many problems will come to the fore .'
p2096
aS'this will lead to a change in system .'
p2097
aS'then everybody will think that if we have changed one village , then we can do the same elsewhere also .'
p2098
aS'what happens now a days ?'
p2099
aS'a scheme comes to a village .'
p2100
aS'a water tank is dug at one place , tube-well at other place .'
p2101
aS'if there is tube-well , there is no water tank and vice-versa .'
p2102
aS'expenditure is done but without outcome .'
p2103
aS'that is why the mp is going to be involved in every activity of village life to bring the focus on the outcome .'
p2104
aS'there is a flexibility in this programme to choose any village .'
p2105
aS'if possible it should have a population of 3,000-5,000 .'
p2106
aS'this does not mean that smaller or bigger habitations are not be touched .'
p2107
aS'this is flexible .'
p2108
aS'but if approximately 3,000 to 5,000 population is there , then a system can be worked out .'
p2109
aS'in hilly and tribal areas where such big villages are not there , the number should be between 1,000 to 3,000 .'
p2110
aS'only one condition has been imposed by me .'
p2111
aS'and that is that the mps must not pick their own village , or village of their in-laws .'
p2112
aS'apart from this , choose any village .'
p2113
aS'even i have to select a village in varanasi .'
p2114
aS'a guideline has been brought out today .'
p2115
aS'i will also go to varanasi and talk to the people there , and after consultation , will select the village .'
p2116
aS'one of the biggest problems for us has been that our development model has been supply-driven .'
p2117
aS'a scheme has been prepared in lucknow , gandhi nagar , or delhi .'
p2118
aS'the same is attempted to be injected .'
p2119
aS'we want to shift this model from supply-driven to demand driven through aadrash gram .'
p2120
aS'there should be an urge developed in the village itself .'
p2121
aS'the villagers should themselves come out and tell us what they need .'
p2122
aS'this scheme is not just to construct a bridge or a pond .'
p2123
aS'can a change be brought about in our todays conditions or not ?'
p2124
aS'someone please tell me that if there is a school , panchayat ghar , temple , or a place of worship in the village , should not that be clean ?'
p2125
aS'do we need a budget to tell us this ?'
p2126
aS'i have been lucky , not many people in political life may have been so lucky .'
p2127
aS'i have travelled for 45 years .'
p2128
aS'must have stayed overnight in more than 400 districts of india .'
p2129
aS'there must have been at least 5,000 villages outside gujarat that i visited .'
p2130
aS'therefore , i understand these things from experience .'
p2131
aS'we should create a confidence in the villages and make them committed to this .'
p2132
aS'please tell me , in a village of 3,000 to 5,000 , how many deliveries take place in a year ?'
p2133
aS'maximum 100 .'
p2134
aS'out of these 50-60 women will be economically sound .'
p2135
aS'25-30 women will be such who will need the villages support for nutrition .'
p2136
aS'if this happens , the chances of malnutrition in the child and maternal mortality will be reduced drastically .'
p2137
aS'if this was to be done by government of india , then a cabinet note would have been prepared , departments comments would have been taken , tender would have been floated .'
p2138
aS'and everyone knows what happens after the tender is floated .'
p2139
aS'then six months later , some breaking news would have come in newspapers .'
p2140
aS'in this , no tender , budget , cabinet or minister is needed .'
p2141
aS'people of the village will collectively decide that if 25 women are expecting and they are poor , then the village will take care of the extra nutritional food for three-four months .'
p2142
aS'i say , friends , this is easy .'
p2143
aS'all we need is to change our mind set .'
p2144
aS'we need to unite peoples hearts .'
p2145
aS'normally mps are engaged in political activities , but after this , when they will come to the village , there will be no political activities .'
p2146
aS'it will be like family .'
p2147
aS'decisions will be taken sitting with the people of the villages .'
p2148
aS'it will re-energise and unite the village .'
p2149
aS'problems will be solved .'
p2150
aS'currently , there is a mid-day meal scheme run by the government .'
p2151
aS'it is a good thing , should be there .'
p2152
aS'often there are 80-100 families in the village who celebrate occasions like birthdays , death anniversaries of family elders etc .'
p2153
aS'they should be contacted and be told that when such celebratory occasions come , they should come go to the school with family .'
p2154
aS'they should bring some sweets to the school and sit with the students for the mid-day meal and share with them .'
p2155
aS'this will lead to a good movement of social harmony .'
p2156
aS'at the same time , this can also work as input to improve the quality of the mid-day meal .'
p2157
aS'this doesnt require any big scheme we can take this forward , cant we ?'
p2158
aS'government is planning to establish gobar gas plants in villages .'
p2159
aS'as you know some one or two persons avail it due to their capacity to get government money .'
p2160
aS'but cow dung is not available .'
p2161
aS'then , in one or two years , the plant becomes a monument .'
p2162
aS'how many monuments will you keep building ?'
p2163
aS'now imagine , that there is a gobar bank of the village .'
p2164
aS'the entire cow dung in the village can be deposited in such a bank and a common gas plant is built with this .'
p2165
aS'gas is supplied to the entire village .'
p2166
aS'our mothers and sisters suffer a lot due to smoke from the chulhas .'
p2167
aS'i am seeing an opportunity which doesnt involve expenditure .'
p2168
aS'those who would deposit the gobar will get the same amount during the agriculture season as fertilizer .'
p2169
aS'this will also bring cleanliness in the village along with fertilizer and gas .'
p2170
aS'improvement in health parameters due to clean village will be an extra benefit .'
p2171
aS'i say that we should take interest in creating such an atmosphere in the village .'
p2172
aS'sometimes i think , are we able to create an atmosphere where people can be proud of village ?'
p2173
aS'unless we create such an atmosphere , change will not come .'
p2174
aS'this is very important .'
p2175
aS'every village has its birthday , why should it not be celebrated like a festival when everybody will come together they will think about what can be done for the village ?'
p2176
aS'i think government schemes were always the foundation of adarsh gram yojana .'
p2177
aS'there is no change in that .'
p2178
aS'but this is an experiment to fill the gaps .'
p2179
aS'if i think that it is the ultimate solution , i will be disbelieving in the thinking power of humanity .'
p2180
aS'no thinking is complete , every thinking moves towards completeness .'
p2181
aS'therefore i believe nothing is ultimate .'
p2182
aS'whatever has happened is good .'
p2183
aS'whatever is happening today is step forward .'
p2184
aS'it will not work if we consider it a full stop .'
p2185
aS'the point is that as per requirement , the government should have flexibility .'
p2186
aS'it should not work by diktat , but it should facilitate .'
p2187
aS'i say this with full faith that any mp will develop his or her village as a place of pilgrimage after 2016 .'
p2188
aS'he/she will tell his/her relatives that i have built a village , lets go and see that .'
p2189
aS'this is the satisfaction level that leads to solutions in the life of a person .'
p2190
aS'jai prakash narayan ji had said an important thing which , i believe , is inspiring even in these times .'
p2191
aS'he said that democracy and politics can not be separated .'
p2192
aS'politics is democracys second nature .'
p2193
aS'this is important .'
p2194
aS'we are fed up of dirty politics .'
p2195
aS'dirty politics gives a bad name to the entire political field .'
p2196
aS'this or that party is not the issue .'
p2197
aS'an atmosphere of trust has suffered .'
p2198
aS'jai prakash narayan ji said something very good .'
p2199
aS'he said that freedom from politics is not the way .'
p2200
aS'we should see how fast liberal and good politics takes the place of dirty politics .'
p2201
aS'i believe that sansad aadarsh gram yojna is opening a new door of creative politics .'
p2202
aS'will i get votes in the village ?'
p2203
aS'are the communities in the village my supporters ?'
p2204
aS'am i on good terms with the local leaders in the village ?'
p2205
aS'we need to rise above all this and leave it all outside the village boundaries when we do this work .'
p2206
aS'here , the village is a community , a cohesive society .'
p2207
aS'can i be a facilitator or a catalytic agent to fulfil their dreams ?'
p2208
aS'can i work as a friend with a feeling of oneness ?'
p2209
aS'when in 2016 this will be discussed in the parliament , mps will speak in the parliament on the basis of the experience .'
p2210
aS'howsoever insensitive the government may be , it will have to acknowledge the experience of the parliamentarian .'
p2211
aS'howsoever strong might be the majority of the government , it will have to change its policies .'
p2212
aS'weight of the parliamentarian is going to increase .'
p2213
aS'no government will be able to deny this because the mp will say that i went to the village , i am working , these are the problems in my village , the policies of your government are wrong , your schemes are incorrect and your officers dont understand .'
p2214
aS'the power of these words will become the reason for change in the governments policies .'
p2215
aS'this country is going to choose bottom-to-top approach .'
p2216
aS'in the academic word bottom-to-top , top-to-bottom approaches are discussed .'
p2217
aS'but we want to make a beginning somewhere .'
p2218
aS'for this i say demand-driven and not supply-driven .'
p2219
aS'can we choose a society-driven development approach rather than a government-driven one ?'
p2220
aS'can we increase peoples participants along with government facilitation ?'
p2221
aS'we were just watching a video about a village in andhra .'
p2222
aS'they have set up 28 committees in such a small village .'
p2223
aS'all are functional , there are not for show .'
p2224
aS'and they have done it .'
p2225
aS'if we take this inspiration , if today parliamentarians and tomorrow mlas will take forward 7-8 thousands villages every year , it will create a viral effect that will change the entire model of development of rural clusters .'
p2226
aS'we should understand that the aspirations of a rural person are no less than an urban person .'
p2227
aS'he is also watching the world and wants a change in his quality of life .'
p2228
aS'he also wants good education for his children .'
p2229
aS'if long distance education is available , he wants it .'
p2230
aS'lets talk about drip irrigation .'
p2231
aS'who can deny that there is a water crisis everywhere ?'
p2232
aS'wont i place drip irrigation in every field of my chosen village ?'
p2233
aS'ill bring all the schemes of the government , will help them in getting loans from banks .'
p2234
aS'can i increase their production through drip irrigation ?'
p2235
aS'economy of the village will change .'
p2236
aS'there will be cattle rearing and increased milk production , improved situation of cattle .'
p2237
aS'i will bring officers , explain things to them and bring change .'
p2238
aS'friends , i believe that rural life can be changed .'
p2239
aS'those mps who have been elected from urban areas and dont have any village , i request them to choose a nearby village .'
p2240
aS'my friends from rajya sabha should select a village of their choice from the states from which they are coming .'
p2241
aS'nominated mps can choose any village from all over india .'
p2242
aS'we will all collectively try to open the door of creative politics and will work away from political untouchability .'
p2243
aS'jai prakash ji , mahatama gandhi , ram manohar lohia ji , pandit deen dayal ji , are such icons of last century whose shadow is there on the political life of today .'
p2244
aS'all may not have impacted all but everyone must have been influenced a little by someone .'
p2245
aS'we should take inspiration from them and move this work ahead .'
p2246
aS'this is my expectation from you .'
p2247
aS'i said on 15th august that on 11th october , on the birth anniversary of jai prakash ji , we will present the guidelines .'
p2248
aS'some of my friends informed me of their selection of village that evening itself .'
p2249
aS'and they were not bjp mps alone .'
p2250
aS'even mps from other parties , for example even congress mps , wrote to me .'
p2251
aS'that day itself i felt that this concept has value .'
p2252
aS'that is why people are adopting it beyond party politics .'
p2253
aS'still there are many like me , who have to select the village .'
p2254
aS'it is pending in my area also because i wanted to decide after the guidelines are prepared and in consultation with the people and officers of varanasi .'
p2255
aS'i will surely do this in the next 15-20 days .'
p2256
aS'we should convey this confidence that there will be more villages in the future .'
p2257
aS'a model is emerging .'
p2258
aS'if we manage to show this model to villagers , change will be automatic .'
p2259
aS'we will bring about rural development by our efforts and not by diktat .'
p2260
aS'the letter has been written and the job is done - this is not like that .'
p2261
aS'this will not be accomplished by asking questions in the parliament .'
p2262
aS'we need to work collectively .'
p2263
aS'i believe that we are experimenting with a new way of serving mother india in a big way .'
p2264
aS'i complement all the parliamentarians from the deepest core of my heart that all party members have accepted this , welcomed this .'
p2265
aS'this is not a final scheme , there will be many changes , many reforms , many practical situations will emerge .'
p2266
aS'this is not a money-related scheme .'
p2267
aS'this scheme is people-driven and will be accomplished through peoples participation and parliamentarians guidance .'
p2268
aS'we should take this forward .'
p2269
aS'with this hope , i thank you all .'
p2270
aS'once again i pay my tributes to jai prakash ji .'

aa(lp2305
S'my dear fellow countrymen , i am with you again almost after a month .'
p2306
aS'a month is quite a long time .'
p2307
aS'lots of things keep happening in the world .'
p2308
aS'you all have recently celebrated the festival of diwali with great fervour and joy .'
p2309
aS'it is these festivals which bring happiness in our daily lives from time to time .'
p2310
aS'be it poor or rich , people from village or from urban areas , festivals hold a different significance in everyones lives .'
p2311
aS'this is my first meeting after diwali , so i convey my very warm wishes to you all .'
p2312
aS'last time we had some general conversation .'
p2313
aS'but then i came to some new realizations after that conversation .'
p2314
aS'sometimes we think leave it .'
p2315
ag1044
ag1044
aS'nothing is going to change , people are indifferent , they will not do anything , our country is like this .'
p2316
aS'from my last conversation in mann ki baat to this one , i would urge you all to change this mindset .'
p2317
aS'neither is our country is like this nor our people indifferent .'
p2318
aS'sometimes i feel the nation is way ahead and the government is lacking behind .'
p2319
aS'and from my personal experience i will say that the governments too needs to change their mindsets .'
p2320
aS'and i say that because i can see tremendous sense of commitment in the indian youth .'
p2321
aS'they are very eager to do their bit and are just seeking an opportunity where they can do their bit .'
p2322
aS'and they are making efforts at their own end .'
p2323
aS'last time i had asked them to buy at least one khadi outfit .'
p2324
aS'i had not asked anyone to be khadidhari , but the feedback i got from khadi stores was that in a weeks time the sales had jumped up by 125 % .'
p2325
aS'in this way , as compared to last year the sales this year is more than double in the week following 2nd oct .'
p2326
aS'this means , the people of our country is many times more than we think of .'
p2327
aS'i salute all my fellow indians .'
p2328
aS'cleanliness.'
p2329
ag1044
aS'can anyone imagine that cleanliness will become a such a huge public movement .'
p2330
aS'the expectations are high and they should be so .'
p2331
aS'i can see some good results , cleanliness can now be witnessed in two parts .'
p2332
aS'one is those huge garbage piles which keep lying in the city ; well the people in the government will work to remove those .'
p2333
aS'it is a big challenge but you can not run away from your responsibilities .'
p2334
aS'all state governments and all municipalities will now have to take concrete actions due to the rising public pressure .'
p2335
aS'media is playing a very positive role in this .'
p2336
aS'but there is the second aspect which gives me immense pleasure , happiness and a sense of satisfaction that the general public has started feeling that leave what happened in the past , now they will not dirty their surroundings .'
p2337
aS'we will not add to the existing dirt .'
p2338
aS'a gentleman mr bharat gupta has sent me a mail on mygov .'
p2339
aS'in from satna , madhya pradesh .'
p2340
aS'he has related his personal experience during his tour of the railways .'
p2341
aS'he said that people eat on trains and usually litter around .'
p2342
aS'he continues to say that he has been touring from the past many years but it is this time around no one was littering , rather they were looking for dustbins to throw their trash .'
p2343
aS'when they could not see any arrangements they collected all their litter in a corner .'
p2344
aS'he says that it was a very gratifying experience for me .'
p2345
aS'i thank bharat ji for sharing this experience with me .'
p2346
aS'what i am seeing is that this campaign has had a great influence on kids .'
p2347
aS'many families mention that now whenever kids eat a chocolate they themselves pick the wrapper and disposes it .'
p2348
aS'i was seeing a message on the social media .'
p2349
aS'someone had posted a picture with the title my hero of the day .'
p2350
aS'this picture was that of a little kid who , picks up trash , wherever he goes , even when going to school .'
p2351
aS'he is himself motivated to do this .'
p2352
aS'just seepeople now feel it is their country and they will not make it dirty .'
p2353
aS'we will not add to the existing dirt pile .'
p2354
aS'and those do litter feel ashamed for someone is around to point it out to them .'
p2355
aS'i consider all these to be good omens .'
p2356
aS'another thing is that many people come to meet me who are from all the sections of the society .'
p2357
aS'they can be government officers , from film world , sports world , industrialists , scientists .'
p2358
aS'all of them , whenever they interact with me , in ten minutes discussion , about four to five minutes the discussion is on social issues .'
p2359
aS'someone talks about cleanliness , while some others talk about education , while someone talks about social reforms .'
p2360
aS'some people discuss the ruining of family life .'
p2361
aS'i initially thought if a businessman comes , he will definitely talk of things of his personal interest .'
p2362
aS'but i am seeing a major change .'
p2363
aS'they talk less about their interest and more about taking on some or the other social responsibility .'
p2364
aS'when i add up all these small incidents i see a larger picture and i realize that we are moving in the right direction .'
p2365
aS'it is true that unhealthy environment leads to diseases and sickness , but where does sickness strike first .'
p2366
aS'it first strikes the poor household .'
p2367
aS'when we work towards cleanliness , we make a major effort in the direction of helping the poor .'
p2368
aS'if the poor families are saved from diseases , then they will be saved from a lot of financial problems .'
p2369
aS'if a person is healthy , then he will work hard , earn for the family and help in running the family smoothly .'
p2370
aS'and so this cleanliness drive is directly related to the health and welfare of my poor brethren .'
p2371
aS'we may not be able to do something to help the poor , but even keeping the environs clean helps the poor in a big way .'
p2372
aS'let us view it from this perspective ; it will be very beneficial .'
p2373
aS'i receive different kinds of letters .'
p2374
aS'last time i had mentioned about our specially abled children .'
p2375
aS'whom god has given some kind of deficiencies ; i had expressed my feelings regarding those people .'
p2376
aS'i see that people who work in this field are sending me their success stories .'
p2377
aS'but i came to know about two things from my people in the government .'
p2378
aS'the people from the hrd ministry after hearing my talk , felt the need to do something .'
p2379
aS'and the officers came together to work out an action plan .'
p2380
aS'this is an example of how changes are coming about in governance .'
p2381
aS'one they have decided that those specially abled who want to pursue technical education , a thousand of them who are good will be selected for special scholarships , and a plan has been made .'
p2382
aS'i congratulate the officials who could think in those lines .'
p2383
aS'another important decision is that all the kendriya vidyalayas and all central universities will have a special infrastructure for the specially abled , for example if they cant climb stairs then there will be provision for ramps to facilitate movement by wheel chair .'
p2384
aS'they need different kinds of toilets .'
p2385
aS'the hrd ministry has decided to allocate an additional lakh rupees to the kendriya vidyalays and central universities .'
p2386
aS'this fund will be used by these institutions to create infrastructure for the specially abled .'
p2387
aS'this is an auspicious beginningthese things will lead us to change .'
p2388
aS'i had the chance to visit siachin a few days back .'
p2389
aS'i spent diwali with the jawans who are ready to lay down their lives for the nation .'
p2390
aS'when the nation was celebrating diwali i was at siachin .'
p2391
aS'it is because of them that we were able to celebrate diwali , so i wanted to be with them .'
p2392
aS'i experienced the difficulties in which they spent their time there .'
p2393
aS'i salute all my jawans .'
p2394
aS'but i want to share another matter of great pride with you .'
p2395
aS'our jawans work in the field of security .'
p2396
aS'in calamities , they risk their lives to save our life .'
p2397
aS'they also fetch medals for us in sporting events .'
p2398
aS'you will be glad to know that these jawans have won a gold medal in a very prestigious event in britain called cambrian patrol , defeating contestants from 140 nations .'
p2399
aS'i offer these jawans my heartiest congratulations .'
p2400
aS'i also got an opportunity to meet , the young and dynamic students , boys and girls over tea who had won medals in sports .'
p2401
aS'they give me renewed energy .'
p2402
aS'i was seeing their zeal and enthusiasm .'
p2403
aS'the facilities in our country are quite less as compared to other nations , but instead of complaining they were just sharing their joy and excitement .'
p2404
aS'for me , this tea programme for these players was very inspiring , and i felt really good .'
p2405
aS'i would like to tell you something more and that too from my heart .'
p2406
aS'i truly believe that people of my country trust my words and my intentions .'
p2407
aS'but , today one more time , i want to reiterate my commitment .'
p2408
aS'as far as black money is concerned , my people , please trust your prime servant , for me this is the article of faith .'
p2409
aS'this is my commitment that the hard-earned money of the poor people stashed abroad , every penny of that should be brought back .'
p2410
aS'the ways and means to be followed can be different .'
p2411
aS'and this is very obvious in a democratic country , but on the basis of as much i understand and as much i know , i assure you that we are on the right track .'
p2412
aS'today , nobody , neither me , nor the government , nor you , nor even the previous government knew how much money is stashed abroad .'
p2413
aS'everyone gives estimate calculated in his/her own way .'
p2414
aS'i dont want to get lost in some such figures and estimates , its my commitment that , be it 2 rupees , or 5 rupees , or millions or even billions , this is the hard-earned money of the poor people of my country and it has to come back .'
p2415
aS'and i assure you that i will keep trying till the end .'
p2416
aS'no efforts will be spared .'
p2417
aS'i want your blessings to be always with me .'
p2418
aS'i assure you that i will do whatever and whenever something is required to be done for you .'
p2419
aS'i give my commitment to you .'
p2420
aS'i have received a letter .'
p2421
aS'it has been sent by sri abhishek pareekh .'
p2422
aS'the same sentiments were expressed to me by many mothers and sisters when i was not even the prime minister .'
p2423
aS'some doctor friends had also expressed their concern and i too have expressed my views on this issue a number of times in the past .'
p2424
aS'mr parikh has drawn my attention towards the increase of drug addiction that is fast catching up with our young generation .'
p2425
aS'he has asked me to discuss this topic in mann ki baat .'
p2426
aS'i agree with his concern and i will definitely include this topic , in my next edition of mann ki baat .'
p2427
aS'i will discuss the topic of drugs , drug addiction and drug mafia and how they are a threat to our countrys youth .'
p2428
aS'if you have some experience , any information in this regard , if you have ever rescued any child from this drug addiction , if you know of any ways and means to help , if any government official has played a good role , if you give me any such information , i will convey such efforts to the public and together we will try to create an environment in each family that no child ever thinks of choosing this vice out of sheer frustration .'
p2429
aS'i will definitely discuss this in detail in the next edition .'
p2430
aS'i know i am choosing those topics which put the government in the dock .'
p2431
aS'but how long will we keep these things hiding ?'
p2432
aS'how long will we brush these important concerns under the carpet ?'
p2433
aS'some day or the other we need to take a call , follow our instincts and for grand intentions tough calls are equally important .'
p2434
aS'i am mustering the courage to do so because your love inspires me to do so .'
p2435
aS'and i will continue to do such things because of your love .'
p2436
aS'some people told me modi ji you asked us to send you suggestions on facebook , twitter or email .'
p2437
aS'but a large section of the social class does not have access to these facilities , so what can they do .'
p2438
aS'your point is very valid .'
p2439
aS'everyone does not have this facility .'
p2440
aS'well then , if you have something to say related to mann ki baat , that you hear on the radio even in the villages then do write into me on the following addressmann ki baatakashvanisansad margnew delhi .'
p2441
aS'even if you send some suggestions through letters they will definitely reach me .'
p2442
aS'and i will take them seriously as active citizens are the biggest asset for development .'
p2443
aS'you write one letter , it indicates that you are very active .'
p2444
aS'when you give your opinion , it means that you are concerned with national issues and this is strength of the nation .'
p2445
aS'i welcome you .'
p2446
aS'for my mann ki baat , your mann ki baat sould also reach me .'
p2447
aS'maybe you will definitely write a letter .'
p2448
aS'i will try and interact with you again next month .'
p2449
aS'i will try , that whenever i talk , it is sunday , around 11 am .'
p2450
aS'so i am getting closer to you .'
p2451
aS'the weather is changing .'
p2452
aS'winters are slowly setting in .'
p2453
aS'this is a good month for health .'
p2454
aS'some find it a good season for eating .'
p2455
aS'some find it good for wearing nice clothes .'
p2456
aS'besides food and clothes it is a good season for health .'
p2457
aS'dont let it go waste .'
p2458
aS'make the most of it .'
p2459
aS'thank you .'
p2460
aa(lp2461
S'minister from up government sri ahmad hussain ji , the local representative from the area sri surendra singh ji , our mlc sri kedar nath singh ji , respected sister durga devi ji , sri arvind ji and my dear brothers and sisters who have gathered here in large numbers .'
p2462
aS'the government of india has envisioned a new programme - the saansad aadarsh graam project .'
p2463
aS'i , being a parliamentarian need to take responsibility of a village under this plan too .'
p2464
aS'i have been reading different versions in the newspapers about my decision to adopt jayapur village for this plan .'
p2465
aS'each one gives some version and this baffles me .'
p2466
aS'i am surprised at how some fertile brains are working to spread stories about my decision to adopt this specific village .'
p2467
aS'such reasons given are ones that even i am not aware of .'
p2468
aS'why i chose this village has a very simple reason and the reason is that when bhartiya janta party chose me to contest elections from banaras , that time a big tragedy occurred where 5 people lost their lives in a fire in jayapur .'
p2469
aS'the first ever name that i became aware of after being selected for the banaras constituency was that of jayapur .'
p2470
aS'that too i heard in a moment of crisis .'
p2471
aS'though i was neither the mp nor we had a government here , i called up the government officials , i called up my party workers and asked them to reach here for help .'
p2472
aS'so this is the reason jayapur occupied a place in my mind and my heart .'
p2473
aS'so our relationship started in a moment of crisis and those relationships that spring from crisis often last a lifetime .'
p2474
aS'so this is the reason for my association with jayapur .'
p2475
aS'i consider this as a fortunate association .'
p2476
aS'rest all the stories being spread are false and they have no basis .'
p2477
aS'none that i am aware of .'
p2478
aS'now some people are writing that the prime minster is adopting a village .'
p2479
aS'well , this scheme is such where it is the other way round i .'
p2480
aS'e .'
p2481
aS'the villages are adopting a parliamentarian .'
p2482
aS'whatever position we may hold , either that of minister , chief minister or even a prime minister , nothing can be compared to the learning that we can receive from the villagers .'
p2483
aS'if i intend to become a good peoples representative , if as a public representative i want to understand people and their problems , learn something worthwhile then i can not do so by sitting with clerks and officers .'
p2484
aS'i can gather this knowledge only by interactions with the learned and experienced people of the village .'
p2485
aS'they might not have been to school or had college education but what they have is a vast store of knowledge and experience .'
p2486
aS'they have such a vast body of experience that they know practical ways of resolving issues , which can be a great learning experience for the public representative .'
p2487
aS'this is why i have chosen jayapur and i request you to adopt me in return and teach me ways to resolve your issues .'
p2488
aS'even after so many years of independence our villages remained where they were then .'
p2489
aS'why so ?'
p2490
aS'it is now your turn to say that for the past 60 years you sat in your offices at lucknow and delhi and made endless policies and spent millions to no avail .'
p2491
aS'now listen to us and do what we think is better for us .'
p2492
aS'i am also witnessing that the villages are competing to be adopted for this scheme .'
p2493
aS'they are expecting the parliamentarian to choose their village for adoption .'
p2494
aS'the reason for this is a misconception among the villagers that if the parliamentarian adopts their village , a lot of money is going to flow in .'
p2495
aS'well this scheme has no money .'
p2496
aS'this scheme does not involve money for if there is money , and then there will definitely be a corrupt person to pocket that money .'
p2497
aS'the reason for launching this scheme was that despite running several schemes and spending lots of money , there was no change in lives of the villagers .'
p2498
aS'the idea of this scheme is to find answers to these very questions .'
p2499
aS'a few days back i invited the senior bureaucrats for tea during diwali .'
p2500
aS'these are those top notch officials who practically run the country .'
p2501
aS'all of them are so highly placed that a common citizen can not possibly approach them .'
p2502
aS'i called them and gave them a job .'
p2503
aS'i asked them to visit the place of their first posting .'
p2504
aS'that very place where they must have been posted for around a year , where they started their careers and received their initial training .'
p2505
aS'i asked them to revisit those places with their children and families .'
p2506
aS'tell them how you started as a fresher , how you functioned out of your first office and try and remember those people who helped you .'
p2507
aS'take your families to meet your acquaintances there .'
p2508
aS'i asked them to spend at least three days in that very same location .'
p2509
aS'and think how far they have reached in these 30-40 years whereas the village you started in remained where it was .'
p2510
aS'go and see for yourself and show the same to your family also .'
p2511
aS'i want to create sensitivity , something that invokes some kind of proactive thought , where they think that it is their responsibility to bring to the forefront all those who supported them when they were new .'
p2512
aS'the public representatives need to think to bring development to all those who have been instrumental in bringing them onto the national political scene .'
p2513
aS'hence it is my vision to go among these very people , work along with them and see that the government policies designed for them are fully implemented .'
p2514
aS'see if there is the desired change in the village .'
p2515
aS'if there is a difficulty in launching these programmes , then whatever policy level changes need to be made can be decided .'
p2516
aS'if the mp is successful in achieving this , then the entire machinery of the government will get accustomed to working for people .'
p2517
aS'i want to create an environment where the residents of jayapur feel empowered about taking a decision for their well being .'
p2518
aS'i have been seeing that jayapur is in limelight these days a lot .'
p2519
aS'many government officials have visited the place .'
p2520
aS'the village was cleaned , roads repaired .'
p2521
aS'on asking why these special efforts are being made , it was the preparation for modi jis visit .'
p2522
aS'the villagers held the view that if modi ji visits the village frequently it will become very clean .'
p2523
aS'are you correct in thinking this way ?'
p2524
aS'now that the village has been cleaned , i would appreciate that you take a call that now all of us work together to keep the village clean .'
p2525
aS'isnt this the beginning of an ideal village ?'
p2526
aS'i want you to think about the oldest tree in the village .'
p2527
aS'have you ever spared it a thought ?'
p2528
aS'has the village school master ever thought of taking his students to that tree and tell them about its age , that it is some 150-200 years old , that generations from grandparents to parents to these children have played under this tree ?'
p2529
aS'this will foster a bonding with that tree .'
p2530
aS'today no village might know about its oldest tree .'
p2531
aS'why is this so ?'
p2532
aS'are we no longer fond of them ?'
p2533
aS'do we think about the elders of the village , how many are above 100 years of age , how many are above 75 years or more ?'
p2534
aS'how many children of the village sit with these elders and talk about the old days , about the childhood of their elders .'
p2535
aS'how was their school , how were their teachers , what were the food habits at that time , how did they cope with the changing seasons .'
p2536
aS'have you ever tried this ?'
p2537
aS'sadly , the closed and family like environment so common in a village scenario has suddenly started shrinking .'
p2538
aS'can we work together to bring back this environment ?'
p2539
aS'let me ask you .'
p2540
aS'do you know the day when your village was established ?'
p2541
aS'there must be a day when this village came into existence .'
p2542
aS'if you do not know then go to the government offices and find out when this village found existence in government records .'
p2543
aS'if no record exists then decide upon a day which would be celebrated as the day when this village was born , like we celebrate our birthday .'
p2544
aS'all those who have left the village in order to earn their living will also come back that day .'
p2545
aS'all the senior people of the village who have attained 75 , 80 or 90 years should be honoured .'
p2546
aS'tell me , on such a day , will you not clean the village ?'
p2547
aS'will there be change in the mindsets or not ?'
p2548
aS'if someone from the village has gone out , and one day if he returns , on finding the school fan missing , he will donate one ?'
p2549
aS'how do we make our village an ideal one , not with the help of the government , but by awakening the collective strength of the society .'
p2550
aS'we will decide that no child in the village would eat without first washing their hands .'
p2551
aS'tell me , do we need the government for this kind of a job .'
p2552
aS'i was reading a report about a neighboring country where 40 out of 100 children die because of diseases related to not washing hands .'
p2553
aS'means 40 children out of hundred died because they did not wash hands .'
p2554
aS'how much do we love our children ?'
p2555
aS'if the kids fall sick everyone feels sad .'
p2556
aS'so let us all decide that no child from this village will ever eat anything without first washing his hands .'
p2557
aS'you will not expect a prime minister to be talking about these issues .'
p2558
aS'there must be some mistake .'
p2559
aS'well our leaders in the past were so accustomed of talking tall , that it never changed the ground realities .'
p2560
aS'i am not here to talk big .'
p2561
aS'i have to achieve a larger goal by these small targets .'
p2562
aS'i want to ask the people of this village , some must have passed 10th , some must have passed 12th grade , some might be graduates , people of different age groups like 50 or 60 years old- have you ever been to the school where your child goes to study ?'
p2563
aS'have you seen the school ?'
p2564
aS'do you check if the teacher comes or not ?'
p2565
aS'is the drinking water clean or dirty , if there is a toilet or a library in the school , if the computers in the school are in a working condition or not .'
p2566
aS'have we ever taken an interest in these issues ?'
p2567
aS'what we have done is admitted our children in school , dumped our child there at the mercy of the teacher and left him to his fate .'
p2568
aS'this attitude doesnt work .'
p2569
aS'we have to be more proactive .'
p2570
aS'we can decide to make a committee of the members of one neighborhood who will go each day and supervise the functioning of the school .'
p2571
aS'tell me then , our school , however small it might be , will truly turn into a temple of learning or not .'
p2572
aS'it is such an easy job .'
p2573
aS'i often tell the poor families in the villages to celebrate the birth of the girl child .'
p2574
aS'but do we really celebrate the birth of a girl .'
p2575
aS'some families often end up feeling sad if a girl child is born .'
p2576
aS'the daughter in law of the household has to face everybodys ire .'
p2577
aS'will our jayapur village celebrate the birth of a girl child ?'
p2578
aS'the goddess of wealth enters our household , so this should be celebrated or not , should we not be equally proud of our daughters .'
p2579
aS'see , how few girls are being born in comparison to the number of boys .'
p2580
aS'the reason of this is that the daughters are killed in the womb itself .'
p2581
aS'if we kill the girl child in the womb itself so how will the social cycle function .'
p2582
aS'if 1000 boys are born and only 800 girls are there , 200 boys will remain unmarried .'
p2583
aS'what then will happen to our villages , our society ?'
p2584
aS'and is this the job of the government ?'
p2585
aS'isnt this our responsibility as a society to protect and honour our women ?'
p2586
aS'that is why i am here today , in jayapur .'
p2587
aS'we have decided whatever we were doing is past , now we have to think of a new way forward .'
p2588
aS'i even say this that if you have a farm or a small piece of land , sow five plants when your daughter is born to celebrate the occasion .'
p2589
aS'the girl will grow up and so will the trees .'
p2590
aS'when she is old enough to get married , sell those trees and you will get the money to marry her off .'
p2591
aS'we have to work together to develop new social structure .'
p2592
aS'when the village celebrates its inception day , there will be no room for casteism .'
p2593
aS'all will live in unity , casteism will not survive and once free of this social ill , no one can stop you from being a force so strong beyond everyones imagination .'
p2594
aS'hence this entire aadarsh gram yojana involves implementing government schemes properly , on time and effectively .'
p2595
aS'we have to implement it in a fashion that optimum results are obtained .'
p2596
aS'the mp will provide necessary guidance and the work will gather momentum .'
p2597
aS'once the government officers realize how the work is to be done in the village , others too will follow soon .'
p2598
aS'i have an intense desire to do many things for this village and the district of banaras which are now under my responsibility .'
p2599
aS'but i do not intend to work in the usual format of the governmental set up utilizing the funds of the government treasury .'
p2600
aS'i want to use the peoples power by encouraging peoples participation .'
p2601
aS'a while back our village pradhan , durga devi ji was giving her speech .'
p2602
aS'i asked her about her qualification ?'
p2603
aS'she informed that she had studied till the eighth standard .'
p2604
aS'now see , how high was her confidence level because of her education .'
p2605
aS'i felt proud ; i was truly impressed by the manner in which she expressed her views .'
p2606
aS'dont we want our daughters to be educated ?'
p2607
aS'if our pradhan is educated , so shall be all the daughters of this village .'
p2608
aS'why is it so , that even for taking polio drops someone from the government office has to come to call us ?'
p2609
aS'shouldnt the youth of the village take the responsibility to see that all children receive polio drops , that no child should be inflicted by polio , that there is no one who is handicapped ?'
p2610
aS'the government can bring you the polio drops but it is your responsibility to see that the children receive it .'
p2611
aS'so we will take this responsibility , wont we ?'
p2612
aS'i have spent time with you , interacted with party workers and officials to understand your problems .'
p2613
aS'i am confident that people in the administration which is primarily being run by the state government , will see to it that the tasks are undertaken and duly taken to their culmination .'
p2614
aS'what the government needs to do and what as villagers we need to do we will decide now .'
p2615
aS'and i repeat , the mp will not adopt the village , rather the village has to adopt the mp .'
p2616
aS'we have to work in a new direction and create an ideal village .'
p2617
aS'i am grateful to the people of jayapur .'
p2618
aS'naturally if i have made inquiries about the works being done , the organizational functioning , then i will try to find new ways too .'
p2619
aS'but i do not wish to discuss this on the stage here .'
p2620
aS'i will raise these issues at the necessary forums .'
p2621
aS'at the same time i expect you people to sit together and decide what works you can undertake and to work on your own collective strengths .'
p2622
aS'i have heard that there is a water crisis in this village .'
p2623
aS'the government will do what it needs to do .'
p2624
aS'but let us decide that we will not allow even a single drop of rainwater to go waste .'
p2625
aS'there will no longer be water crisis .'
p2626
aS'but all of us have to work together for this .'
p2627
aS'whatever we have been doing is past .'
p2628
aS'now we have to think of a new way forward .'
p2629
aS'we have to march ahead with our social strength .'
p2630
aS'we will no longer wait for the government to do something for us .'
p2631
aS'we will work together as a force and involve our neighbouring villages too .'
p2632
aS'i have seen this happening in some villages .'
p2633
aS'the people have done it and so will jayapur do it .'
p2634
aS'i express my gratitude for the love and respect showered by you and i want to assure you that we will work together as a team to create a new jayapur , a better jayapur .'
p2635
aS'with this belief in my heart , i express my sincere gratitude to you all .'
p2636
aS'thank you !'
p2637
aa(lp2638
S'today i have started the programme of cleaning the ghats .'
p2639
aS'the social organizations of this place have assured me that the ghat will be cleaned within a month .'
p2640
aS'after many years , i understand that this gift of cleanliness would be a unique one .'
p2641
aS'today , i have started and carried forward this task of cleaning the ghats in my constituency of varanasi .'
p2642
aS'i will nominate 9 people .'
p2643
aS'as per our programme , after cleaning the ghats each person will nominate nine other persons .'
p2644
aS'when i started the cleanliness drive in delhi i had nominated nine people .'
p2645
aS'today again i will nominate nine people specially associated with uttar pradesh .'
p2646
aS'one is the chief minister of up shri akhilesh ji yadav .'
p2647
aS'the chancellor of the handicapped university in chitrakoot , jagat guru swami rambhadracharya ji .'
p2648
aS'one of the famous bhojpuri singer and also our mp from bjp who is also associated with this place shri manoj tiwari ji .'
p2649
aS'the one to earn his place in the literary world by writing the biography of lord krishna , respected manu sharma ji .'
p2650
aS'cricketer and an inspiration for the youth shri mohammad kaif .'
p2651
aS'padmashree awardee and renowned sanskrit scholar , guru devi prasad dwivedi ji .'
p2652
aS'a gift from up who has created a name for himself by his comedies , sri raju srivastava ji .'
p2653
aS'the present cricketing icon of the new generation , sri suresh raina ji .'
p2654
aS'renowned singer with a distinct identity for his music and a son of meerut , a singer well acclaimed , sri kailash kher ji .'
p2655
aS'i have nominated these nine people .'
p2656
aS'i request them to take this cleanliness drive forward and they also nominate nine people under them and take this cycle ahead .'
p2657
aS'thank you very much to you all .'
p2658
aa(lp2659
S'my colleague and cabinet minister dr.'
p2660
aS'harshvardhan ji , all the respected members sharing the stage and gathering dedicated to ayurveda !'
p2661
aS'it was being announced that a brainstorm-churning has happened here for three days and elixir of life has been found .'
p2662
aS'so i have also come to take this elixir so that few drops would come in my fate and i dont know whether i would get it a full pitcher or not .'
p2663
aS'this time the theme is something like health challenges and ayurveda .'
p2664
aS'isnt it ?'
p2665
aS'you must have discussed on a variety of points but to me the biggest challenges are we , the people attached to ayurveda .'
p2666
aS'it is hard to find ayurveda-doctor who is 100 % dedicated to it .'
p2667
aS'even they realise that they cant make it through this path and that they have to take the path to allopathy .'
p2668
aS'so they ask patients to start with allopathic medicines for first three days and ayuvedic treatment can be taken care of in successive stages .'
p2669
aS'i feel this mentality is the extraordinary challenge against ayurveda .'
p2670
aS'if these persons practising ayurveda would not be committed , devoted and confident then how those patients would trust them ?'
p2671
aS'when i was a kid , there was a joke in circulation that a traveller went to a city .'
p2672
aS'he visited a restaurant and asked to see the owner .'
p2673
aS'he was told that the owner has gone to take a meal in a restaurant across the road .'
p2674
aS'now think who would like to eat in such restaurant ?'
p2675
aS'they cant win the trust of others , who dont believe in themselves and their traditions .'
p2676
aS'crisis is not of the ayurveda , but its practitioners .'
p2677
aS'i dont know how do you take this discussion , in a pleasant or bitter way ?'
p2678
aS'but if it is bitter , then i think that i am referring the matter exactly according to the norms of ayurveda because in ayurveda what tastes bitter at first turns sweet ultimately .'
p2679
aS'i have been meeting many people and talking to them .'
p2680
aS'last time when i was chief minister of gujarat , i had called meeting of specialists of ayurveda .'
p2681
aS'this was not my domain at that time and i was working within state of gujarat , but there was a need of awareness about ayurveda .'
p2682
aS'ayurveda is not a field to be limited to a certified doctor .'
p2683
aS'our ancestors have made health , a part of our life .'
p2684
aS'today we have outsourced our health and lifestyle .'
p2685
aS'those days , health was not outsourced .'
p2686
aS'it was part of lifestyle and due to that every person , every family was aware about wellness of body .'
p2687
aS'if any problem would pop up , then what could be possible solutions , people were conscious about that too .'
p2688
aS'even today you must be feeling that experience .'
p2689
aS'at times when you are travelling in a train or bus and suppose a baby is crying a lot , you must have observed that 12-15 persons would come there and they would provide a variety of suggestive measures .'
p2690
aS'one would say to give a dose of something , another would suggest some different dosage and third would even take out some packet asking to give a dose of that .'
p2691
aS'we dont even ask who that person was , whether he was a doctor or not .'
p2692
aS'but when he assures us , we believe him that by giving that dose would bring relief to her as the baby is in pain and crying and he might have a solution to this .'
p2693
aS'we see these very often in course of our journey in a train or bus that if a co-passenger falls sick then one or other passenger would come over and treat him , even when he or she is not a designated doctor or specialist in ayurveda , nor a graduate in ayurveda from jamnagar university .'
p2694
aS'but because this has been a natural practise in india and a habit incubated under traditions , we have some knowledge of it .'
p2695
aS'gradually we outsourced the complete health sector .'
p2696
aS'if any medical problem crops up , we have to take advice and consultation and we have to go according to prescription .'
p2697
aS'if that treatment is successful then it alright otherwise we go to other practitionerwe change the consultancy .'
p2698
aS'the first and only necessity for the solution of this problem is that we should not compromise our core sector , let me be a student of ayurveda , a teacher of ayurveda or engaged in manufacturing of ayurveda medicine or a promoter of holistic healthcare .'
p2699
aS'we should be 100 % committed to what we do , only then we will start seeing the results .'
p2700
aS'some negative circumstances have been encountered , due to which tired and desperate people are traversing back to the basics in the name of holistic health care .'
p2701
aS'they are feeling that modern era medical science might give instant relief but it doesnt guarantee a healthy body as a whole .'
p2702
aS'if at all we want the assurances of health , we would have to choose holistic approach .'
p2703
aS'be it naturopathy , ayurveda , strict diet-control method or homeopathy ; there is always a way in that direction and perhaps that is why ayurveda is known to us as panchamveda .'
p2704
aS'it has been valued and nurtured as such .'
p2705
aS'there is not a part from the root to the fruit of a tree in nature which doesnt find a valuable position in ayurveda .'
p2706
aS'from the root to the fruit is a great deal and it means our ancestors must have had a microscopic study of attributes , its nature , its utility in practice .'
p2707
aS'and after all those extraneous work they would have reached the miraculous position .'
p2708
aS'how do we keep that great resource in modern times is the second challenge to us .'
p2709
aS'it is not possible for us to wait for this world to learn sanskrit language and then accept the preparative .'
p2710
aS'but the least we could do is to translate the exalted resource in the language this world understands .'
p2711
aS'so the workforce engaged in this industry should be motivated to do the research in the area with a time limit under an institutional framework and present all the research works .'
p2712
aS'third point is regarding research articles published in science magazines all over the world .'
p2713
aS'cant we altogether launch a movement and try to put some pressure and also encourage people involved in this sector to publish a research article in every ayurvedic sessionmake them a part of curriculum .'
p2714
aS'one should be made to write an essay or article in modern terminologies with a profound study on a subject for once at the interval of every two year if he or she is a professor and in case of a student , in the final year of their education .'
p2715
aS'and it should be published in international magazines or we should better say that 10 % of all the space in the magazines of international medicine should be dedicated to ayurveda .'
p2716
aS'we would have our research articles at par though differently .'
p2717
aS'if we could find a place for our research articles in at international forum then world working on medical science would notice it .'
p2718
aS'if we would dedicate 20 % of our work and 20 % of spaces would be dedicated to ayurvedic research articles then the world reading modern medical science would notice it eventually , and may be this would change the perspective of modern medical scientists in a positive way .'
p2719
aS'i feel this might crystallize into a new stimulant to give new directions to ayurveda .'
p2720
aS'but for this there should be a proper follow-up and identification of medical science magazines available globally .'
p2721
aS'we also need to find out if among all those magazines whether or not ayurveda has a place .'
p2722
aS'and if ayurveda is to given some space right there , then someone would have to discuss this and keep following it up with the concerned .'
p2723
aS'in a sense we have to launch a movement that where there is a global acceptance , how we carve a niche for us there .'
p2724
aS'till a matter doesnt reach to us via america , we dont usually accept the same , and its become a human tendency and in particular a feature of our fellow countrymen after 1200 yearlong slavery it has penetrated deep into our veins .'
p2725
aS'so if an article is published in an international magazine then rest assured that the ayurvedic doctor would adorn his drawing room wall with his photo frame .'
p2726
aS'i dont know if people associated with ayurveda have studied these or not .'
p2727
aS'when pundit nehru was the prime minister , then these matters were dealt with differently in those social conditions .'
p2728
aS'government then looked for an approach to promote ayurveda on grounds that why such a massive stream of ours is getting destroyed .'
p2729
aS'then a hathi commission was constituted .'
p2730
aS'there was a cabinet minister named jai sukhlal hathi and commission was assigned a task to come up with suggestive measures to rejuvenate and promote ayurveda .'
p2731
aS'its perhaps a report of year 1960 and quite a marvellous one .'
p2732
aS'in that report there is an interesting suggestion on the first page itself .'
p2733
aS'in that , its been said that there is a need to change the packaging , because that packetall those herbs is to be taken a bag fullget the same boiled , re-boil with two litres of water , and the next time it is to be halvedthen keep it overnightboil again to reduce it to half .'
p2734
aS'these practises were not swallowed by common people .'
p2735
aS'he further writes that it needs to be packaged as such that common people find it easy to use .'
p2736
aS'gradually there has been some change .'
p2737
aS'today people opting ayurvedic medicine dont face such challenges of taking the herbs back home , boiling them and then make use of it .'
p2738
aS'now they find it readymade , in medicinal forms , in tablet forms and likewise .'
p2739
aS'that mean these are available in all the forms at par with an allopathic medicine .'
p2740
aS'we are in need of such developmental changes .'
p2741
aS'so there should be joint efforts in a year to two consisting of researchers , students and manufacturers in ayurvedic field and not for doctors to prescribe the medicine manufactured for some specific company .'
p2742
aS'please understand the point i am referring to and inculcate it .'
p2743
aS'it should be ensure how the production of medicine can be improved .'
p2744
aS'likewise , whether the herbs we have studied in vedic texts are available and this is a field of intense research .'
p2745
aS'there would be many medicines written in vedic texts that would prescribe a root of a specific tree or plant to be used for medicinal purposes .'
p2746
aS'today it would seem difficult to find those trees and plants if searched in accordance with the description illustrated in those texts .'
p2747
aS'i have this experience because when i was the chief minister of gujarat , i had ordered to construct a teerthankar-forest for all the 24 teerthankars as they got their enlightenment under some or other tree .'
p2748
aS'so i thought constructing a teerthankar-forest and plant those 24 trees right there in that forest .'
p2749
aS'when i started searching for the trees , i was shocked .'
p2750
aS'i went as far as indonesia to find those trees but couldnt find them all .'
p2751
aS'it means one of the biggest challenges before us is the basic of ayurveda , which is herbal plantation .'
p2752
aS'how do we proceed in that direction and how do we plan a movement in that field ?'
p2753
aS'if you get an opportunity to visit bhavnagar , then also visit palitana jain shrine .'
p2754
aS'there we have built a pavak-van , back then when i was in gujarat .'
p2755
aS'its situated at the base , right before the elevation of palitana .'
p2756
aS'that garden landscape is built in shape of a human body .'
p2757
aS'its extent is vast enough almost 200 meters in length .'
p2758
aS'relevant plants and trees have been planted in accordance to the parts of human body which is treated by that particular type of herb .'
p2759
aS'if its the heart , then the trees related to the cure of heart diseases have been planted there .'
p2760
aS'if its the problem and pains related to knee , then herbal plants and trees related to the cure has been planted at the place of knee in the garden .'
p2761
aS'if a person visits that garden , he would easily identify the relevant herb and that the medicament from that very herb would help me in cure of a disease related to this very part of my body .'
p2762
aS'the purpose to be fulfilled is an easy behaviour to describe an ancient knowledge in modern perspectives .'
p2763
aS'later when students tour the places , they also learn about the particulars of diseases and its curative medicinal plants .'
p2764
aS'if we see the things around us , we learn faster .'
p2765
aS'according to our shastras also , india is a country where crore of god-forms have been excogitated , and here we have devotee for each type of god .'
p2766
aS'if the devotee is a wrestler , then the god is hanuman and if the devout are adorer of money , then the goddess is lakshmi .'
p2767
aS'if the devotee is interested in knowledge , then the goddess is saraswati .'
p2768
aS'so here the state of affairs is as many gods as the number of devotees .'
p2769
aS'so lets keep one thing in mind , the number of god being worshipped in our country , each one of them has a tree associated .'
p2770
aS'observe how marvellous the environment friendly society was and the imagination of such environment friendly society .'
p2771
aS'there is no form of the god which is not associated with a tree or plant , and a bird or animalwe dont have any god as such .'
p2772
aS'these were the ways to broadcast the knowledge with ease .'
p2773
aS'on these ways only , ayurveda was a part of common people .'
p2774
aS'we can change the things around if we have devotion like that .'
p2775
aS'thats why people trust ayurveda , however educated they are and if the body is to be purified internally , ayurveda is the best way to go .'
p2776
aS'this is a perception amongst almost everyone .'
p2777
aS'they accept that if internal cleansing is to be done , then take a shelter of ayurveda and it would be achieved quickly .'
p2778
aS'but many a times ayurveda is mocked also .'
p2779
aS'once , a guest was invited in a family of ayurveda practitioner .'
p2780
aS'the lady of the house asked her husband to bring some vegetables from the market place for the guest .'
p2781
aS'the practitioner husband went to market to buy vegetables .'
p2782
aS'he returned with leaves of neem tree .'
p2783
aS'when the wife asked reasons , he said that he had gone to market .'
p2784
aS'when he saw potatoes , he thought of illness related to the consumption of same .'
p2785
aS'he saw brinjals , again he realised some diseases related to them .'
p2786
aS'then he realised he is not looking at vegetables , but the diseases themselves all around .'
p2787
aS'and at last , he returned with neem leaves .'
p2788
aS'so at times we have to search a practical application of knowledge .'
p2789
aS'if there is no practical approach to the knowledge , it gets ditched in the interstices of time .'
p2790
aS'that is the reason that the focal area for us should be to develop an accepted and easy norm .'
p2791
aS'i acknowledge that a great deal of time has passed around the world and since last 50 years allopathy has captured the medicinal world .'
p2792
aS'but people frustrated with allopathy have turned towards holistic health care .'
p2793
aS'all the institutions of the world are talking about food grain repertory and health funds and medical science is seeing itself in a new form .'
p2794
aS'we have this inheritance .'
p2795
aS'but it is important to see this inheritance in modern perspective .'
p2796
aS'if a change is required then we ought to change it .'
p2797
aS'and if we can achieve this then we would respond aptly to the challenges posed to us which could develop the trust factor in people .'
p2798
aS'lifestyle has been associated with ayurveda .'
p2799
aS'in many ways ayurveda is connected to a way of life .'
p2800
aS'perhaps we never thought of this .'
p2801
aS'today few people sitting around here are clapping also .'
p2802
aS'at the back , there are many students .'
p2803
aS'their mind must be deliberating how will i make my career , how these small packets of herbs would help me going around with my professional life .'
p2804
aS'this must be dwelling in their minds .'
p2805
aS'after they go back from this discussion , then also this confusion wont fade away , given that now we could not become a doctor , but becoming a vaidyaraj- an ayurveda practitioner .'
p2806
aS'but something needs be done to run a life .'
p2807
aS'in spite of that , i would suggest that there is no reason for them to be disheartened .'
p2808
aS'i am saying this especially to this new generation .'
p2809
aS'we have examples and we can learn from those examples .'
p2810
aS'even in our country which is the genesis of yoga , the india which imparted knowledge of yoga to the world , we had assumed that yoga is no more of our use .'
p2811
aS'this is a project for sages in caves of the himalayas who sit and meditate .'
p2812
aS'and in a way common people kept themselves aloof from it .'
p2813
aS'does anyone imagine that how yoga has become a point of central discussion all over the world , keeping in mind the state of yoga 30 years back ?'
p2814
aS'what is the reason that big multinational companies have a space for a stress management institute in their company in the same way as keep ceos ?'
p2815
aS'why ?'
p2816
aS'the moments of crisis brought about by reasons of frustration and depression leads a person to search a way for an eternal peace and for them yoga comes as a relieveras a rescue .'
p2817
aS'i have tried so many ways ; i tried even drugs , but could find any satisfaction .'
p2818
aS'now if i traverse back to this path , i would find the specific .'
p2819
aS'even though we had detached ourselves from the yoga , the world now is connected to it , then the ayurveda to which we are acting indifferent today , may be tomorrow the world would get connected to it too .'
p2820
aS'we have a live example here .'
p2821
aS'we can sprout the faith in common man about ayurveda only after we have confidence of this stature .'
p2822
aS'so if we try for this and i am confident it would certainly be helpful .'
p2823
aS'even today , the exported herbal medicines are prescribed all over the world as additional food supplements due to hindrance in the laws of herbal medicines .'
p2824
aS'it is sent in the name of additional food supplements .'
p2825
aS'it has not been accepted as a prescribed medicinal form .'
p2826
aS'do you know the powers of these pharmaceutical companies ?'
p2827
aS'they would not let you enter so easily in the market .'
p2828
aS'they would not provide certification of global acceptance norms for these medicines .'
p2829
aS'the challenge is arduous , but if common man starts to believe in it then nobody can stop you , however huge the organization is .'
p2830
aS'i am looking at yet another problem .'
p2831
aS'blessed be ayurveda and it should do well .'
p2832
aS'but what is is we have created a contrasting relationship between ayurveda and allopathy .'
p2833
aS'such is our complete terminology and these terminologies need to be changed .'
p2834
aS'even we argue that ayurveda is what cures a disease from its root , allopathy provides only superficial relief and we follow the same .'
p2835
aS'we say that allopathy is a path , whereas ayurveda is a lifestyle .'
p2836
aS'we should focus on changing the emphasis of ayurveda .'
p2837
aS'it would not be beneficial for us if we take a contrarian view of allopathyy .'
p2838
aS'our benefit is in the fact that as yoga has carved a niche for itself , ayurveda too can do so .'
p2839
aS'if a new disease comes in picture , then allopathy would take care of it .'
p2840
aS'but if new disease doesnt show up then only ayurveda can handle that .'
p2841
aS'and this is a belief of all common man that this is the solution .'
p2842
aS'you see , how so ever famous a doctor or surgeon be , in case of loose motion at the advent of sprouting of teeth to grandchildren , they take the kids to a homeopath doctor .'
p2843
aS'he takes the kids for medicines so that when teeth come , they dont suffer with loose motion do you agree with me .'
p2844
aS'for the wellbeing of their kids , they leave their way of treatment .'
p2845
aS'this faith is too big a thing .'
p2846
aS'i am very well versed with an event .'
p2847
aS'there was a doctor named vanikar , where i lived in gujarat .'
p2848
aS'now he is no more now .'
p2849
aS'he was very famous , perhaps first m .'
p2850
aS's .'
p2851
aS'in pathology from gujarat and had studied abroad .'
p2852
aS'he used to run a pathology laboratory .'
p2853
aS'once in his family relations , a kid got severely ill .'
p2854
aS'he was infant aged approximately 2-3 months old .'
p2855
aS'time passed but there was no sign of improvement .'
p2856
aS'he was taken to a vaidyaraj- an ayurveda practitioner .'
p2857
aS'whole family was there and many people from pathology world were also present .'
p2858
aS'when they got tired of their trials , the kid was taken to vaidyaraj .'
p2859
aS'i had known that practitioner .'
p2860
aS'he examined the kid and asked his wife to bring some sweet halwa .'
p2861
aS'then these men requested the vaidyaraj that they had their breakfast , so did not want to eat halwa .'
p2862
aS'vaidyaraj replied that he was not asking halwa for them but for the kid .'
p2863
aS'but the question was that the infant was of 3 months , how can he eat halwa ?'
p2864
aS'but whatever the herbs to be mixed must have been known to the wife , so she brought a spoonful halwa and vaidyaraj himself fed the halwa to baby from his fingers .'
p2865
aS'almost after half an hour of effort , little by little some amount of it was fed .'
p2866
aS'within three days the infant started showing improvement .'
p2867
aS'these doctors would tell me that we being a big name in the field of allopathyy , but we couldnt treat own own grandson .'
p2868
aS'this vaidyaraj amazed me by a spoonful of medicinal halwa .'
p2869
aS'the moral of this story is there is certainly some power in this knowledge .'
p2870
aS'the problem is of our faith .'
p2871
aS'once we start believing , this strength will multiply four-fold and this world would accept it as a way of life and because of it from health point of view for a healthy society and secondly the biggest advantage is that it is one of the cheapest medicines it is not at all costly .'
p2872
aS'nowadays , i am engaged in giving speeches at elections and it hurts my throat .'
p2873
aS'i receive hundreds of calls suggesting me to take some turmeric .'
p2874
aS'now those people dont know what effects does turmeric has .'
p2875
aS'but when they know that there is sore throat , they know turmeric powder can be taken and i can continue delivering speeches .'
p2876
aS'such a simple and easy mechanism had developed in our society , we need to revitalise it .'
p2877
aS'i understand that in these 2-3 days of discussion many of such points must have caught your attention .'
p2878
aS'on that basis formulate a plan .'
p2879
aS'i would certainly cooperate in such ambitious projects as the government of india and my support would always be there with you .'
p2880
aS'i wish you all a healthy life , because doctors need to be healthy to treat patients .'
p2881
aS'secondly , i request you all to take up ayurveda with sense of devotion only , not only on grounds of a profession .'
p2882
aS'it is for the wellbeing of a society at large and for a great leap of developmental changes .'
p2883
aS'march forward with this faith in you .'
p2884
aS'i am blessed to have shared the space with you .'
p2885
aS'this occasion is coming to a close .'
p2886
aS'i wish you all the best .'
p2887
aS'thank you .'
p2888
aa(lp2889
S'your excellency , president u thein sein , i am grateful to you for organising this summit and chairing the session with great statesmanship .'
p2890
aS'under your leadership , myanmar is playing an important role in the region and it has also benefited india-asean relations .'
p2891
aS'i am grateful to each of you for your views .'
p2892
aS'they have further reinforced my confidence in the india-asean strategic partnership .'
p2893
aS'above all , like good friends , you all wish to see a successful and prosperous india .'
p2894
aS'i want to make a few points now .'
p2895
aS'there are many similarities and convergences between us .'
p2896
aS'india and asean are second and third in terms of population .'
p2897
aS'we are among the largest economies and among the three fastest growing economies in this century .'
p2898
aS'majority of us here belong to the developing world .'
p2899
aS'we have the strength and the potential of a young population .'
p2900
aS'in india , 800 million people below the age of 35 years constitute a huge opportunity .'
p2901
aS'we have embarked on a new economic journey in india .'
p2902
aS'we are emphasizing infrastructure , manufacturing , trade , agriculture , skill development , urban renewal , smart cities .'
p2903
aS'make in india is a new mission .'
p2904
aS'we are placing as much emphasis on ease of doing business in india as we are on making policies attractive .'
p2905
aS'i invite you to this new environment in india .'
p2906
aS'indian companies are also keep to invest in and trade with asean .'
p2907
aS'i also assure you that there will be major improvement our trade policy and environment .'
p2908
aS'we will also move ahead with connectivity projects with asean with speed .'
p2909
aS'i also suggest that we conduct a review of our free trade agreement on goods to improve it further and make it beneficial to all .'
p2910
aS'also urge that the fta on service and investment be brought into force at the earliest .'
p2911
aS'many of you have spoken about the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement .'
p2912
aS'it can be a springboard for economic integration and prosperity in the region .'
p2913
aS'however , we should aim for a balanced agreement , which is beneficial to all ; and , is truly comprehensive in nature , by equally ambitious agenda with similar timelines for goods and services .'
p2914
aS'to deepen our connectivity , i am considering establishing , with your cooperation , a special facility or special purpose vehicle to facilitate project financing and quick implementation .'
p2915
aS'however , in this age , more than physical connectivity , we need information highways or i-ways .'
p2916
aS'my experience is that even where road connectivity is poor , we can create vast economic opportunities and employment through i-ways .'
p2917
aS'india is prepared to provide all assistance and cooperation in this area .'
p2918
aS'asean and india have large cities and are experiencing urbanization at a rapid pace .'
p2919
aS'this is both a challenge and opportunity .'
p2920
aS'come and participate in building indias 100 smart cities and renewal of 500 cities .'
p2921
aS'science and technology and education are important areas of cooperation .'
p2922
aS'we should think ambitiously of what we can do in renewal energy and energy efficiency .'
p2923
aS'let us think of a major asean india solar project for research , manufacturing and deployment .'
p2924
aS'space science can give us benefit in many sectors .'
p2925
aS'we should quickly establish the new india-asean space-related ground station in vietnam and start the project for upgrading the existing station in indonesia .'
p2926
aS'as neighbours , india and asean can gain a lot from cooperation in the disaster risk reduction , response and management .'
p2927
aS'india is prepared to offer full assistance in capacity building , coordination and response in the region .'
p2928
aS'we should further enhance our cooperation in health , including traditional medicine , climate change and environment and forests .'
p2929
aS'agriculture and food security is another area where i see great potential for cooperation , as some of you have mentioned .'
p2930
aS'we should move quickly towards mutual recognition of degrees .'
p2931
aS'we should conduct more research and exchanges on our ancient links and how our shared heritage can be of use to the modern world .'
p2932
aS'skill development is essential for creating employment opportunities for our youth and for our economic development .'
p2933
aS'we should collaborate by sharing our respective areas expertise in skill development .'
p2934
aS'i personally lay great emphasis on people-to-people contacts .'
p2935
aS'i would like to see increased contacts between students , youth , teachers , parliamentarians , diplomats , media , farmers , artists and experts .'
p2936
aS'tourism has not grown the way it should .'
p2937
aS'today , of course , asean region is the most popular destination for indian tourists .'
p2938
aS'i want to see further increase in asean tourists in india .'
p2939
aS'in this , the buddhist circuit represents a vast opportunity .'
p2940
aS'excellencies , we pay a lot of attention to economic prosperity and protecting our environment .'
p2941
aS'do we pay the same attention to the security and safety of our youth ?'
p2942
aS'we have received a high level of security cooperation from asean countries for which i am grateful .'
p2943
aS'but , we should further strengthen our cooperation on countering terrorism , extremism , drugs , arms , and money laundering .'
p2944
aS'excellencies , asias future is bright , but it also faces many challenges .'
p2945
aS'our progress and prosperity depends on peace and stability in the region .'
p2946
aS'there is wave of change in the world .'
p2947
aS'new realities are emerging in the changed world .'
p2948
aS'globalisation is a fact of life .'
p2949
aS'we are all affected by it and we have all benefited from it .'
p2950
aS'and , in this world , maritime trade and passage , and therefore , maritime security has become even more important .'
p2951
aS'we all have the responsibility that we all follow international law and norms on maritime issues , as we do in the realm of air passage .'
p2952
aS'in future , we will also need this in space .'
p2953
aS'for peace and stability in south china sea , everyone should follow international norms and law .'
p2954
aS'this includes the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea .'
p2955
aS'we also hope that you will be able to successfully implement the guidelines to the 2002 declaration on conduct and that the code of conduct on south china sea can be concluded soon on the basis of consensus .'
p2956
aS'finally , i would like to say that it is a great privilege to meet all of you here .'
p2957
aS'this has doubled my confidence and enthusiasm about our relations with asean .'
p2958
aS'i assure you of my sustained personal attention to relations with asean so that we can meet our high expectations from this relationship .'
p2959
aa(lp2960
S'i am very pleased to have the privilege to participate in the india-asean summit .'
p2961
aS'i am particularly honoured that i got this opportunity in myanmar .'
p2962
aS'myanmar is our great neighbor , with which we have had historically very close relations .'
p2963
aS'further , indias eastern journey begins on the western boundary of myanmar .'
p2964
aS'excellency , i am grateful to you for your warm welcome and hospitality ; congratulate you on the excellent arrangements ; and wish you great success in hosting the asean and east asia summits .'
p2965
aS'my government has been in office for six months and the intensity and momentum with which we have enhanced our engagement in the east , is a reflection of the priority that we give to this region .'
p2966
aS'we have close bilateral relations with each of you and we treat the relations with asean with the same importance .'
p2967
aS'today asean has established its own identity and voice in global political and economic affairs .'
p2968
aS'today , the entire asia-pacific region desires integration and cooperationto achieve this extremely important goal we look at asean , not only for inspiration but also for its leadership ; and you have achieved a great deal of success in leading us in that direction .'
p2969
aS'the asean community is indias neighbour .'
p2970
aS'we have ancient relations of trade , religion , culture , art and traditions .'
p2971
aS'we have enriched each other through our interaction .'
p2972
aS'this constitutes a strong foundation of a modern relationship .'
p2973
aS'that is why our world view is similar in many respects ; our mutual confidence and trust is strong .'
p2974
aS'we have no irritants in our relationship .'
p2975
aS'we see encouraging opportunities and challenges in the world in similar ways .'
p2976
aS'asean and india have the vigour and enthusiasm of its youth and wisdom and understanding of its ancient civilisations .'
p2977
aS'rapidly developing india and asean can be great partners for each other .'
p2978
aS'we are both keen to enhance our cooperation in advancing balance , peace and stability in the region .'
p2979
aS'we have been successful to a considerable extent in pursuing our dreams .'
p2980
aS'we have laid a foundation for a strong and comprehensive strategic partnership .'
p2981
aS'but , our potential is much higher than where we are at the moment .'
p2982
aS'a new era of economic development , industrialization and trade has begun in india .'
p2983
aS'externally , indias look east policy has become act east policy.'
p2984
aS'we greatly respect the enthusiasm with which you have extended the hand of friendship to india .'
p2985
aS'today the world and the region need a strong india-asean partnership ; that is why we believe that we are entering in a new era in the india-asean partnership .'
p2986
aS'i look forward keenly to hear your views .'
p2987
aS'but before i end , i want to thank his majesty sultan hassan-al bolkiah of brunei for injecting so much energy in india-asean relationship as country-coordinator .'
p2988
aS'i am also confident that vietnam , as the next country-coordinator , will take our relationship to an even higher plane .'
p2989
aa(lp2990
S'your rights will remain the way they are .'
p2991
aS'i will try to ensure that all your rights are being granted to you .'
p2992
aS'i shall come again .'
p2993
aS'as a foreigner you might have experienced the shifting perspective of the world towards you in the past few months .'
p2994
aS'the manner in which the other powerful governments are looking at india , you as indians must feel proud at being an indian .'
p2995
aS'but when such an opportunity arises , our responsibility also increases manifold .'
p2996
aS'earlier no one considered us to be important enough to be noticed but now every move of ours is scrutinized with utmost attention .'
p2997
aS'hence the indian society not just the government or the country but even the indian communities around the world are being watched closely we are being evaluated closely .'
p2998
aS'they are trying to find a way to reach us .'
p2999
aS'the ones who did not even respond to our namastes ( greetings ) earlier are now trying to hug us .'
p3000
aS'you all must have experienced this , havent you ?'
p3001
aS'do you see the change ?'
p3002
aS'do you feel people are treating you with much more respect now ?'
p3003
aS'this is our one such prized possession which we have to protect as well as enhance .'
p3004
aS'irrespective of the country we stay in , we should constantly strive to be worthy of their love and respect , contributing our best towards their betterment and also our own .'
p3005
aS'however , it shouldnt be the case that only our neighbours prosper ; you should also prosper and set new benchmarks of development and success !'
p3006
aS'india and myanmar are historically linked .'
p3007
aS'we fought for our independence together .'
p3008
aS'and even today the people of this country treat india with reverence due to buddha .'
p3009
aS'we are constantly striving to be of use to our neighbouring nations as we feel that it is our duty .'
p3010
aS'a few days back , i had made an announcement that we will build and send into orbit , a satellite that will be dedicated to saarc .'
p3011
aS'and while i am in this country , i would like to announce that the benefits of this dedicated satellite will be provided to myanmar as well .'
p3012
aS'the main benefits of this satellite will be seen in the health sector , education and long-distance education sector and tele-medicine sector .'
p3013
aS'by doing this , we are also trying to think about ensuring maximum benefits for planet earth .'
p3014
aS'we have decided to shoulder a few responsibilities and announce them in the upcoming saarc meeting that is to be held in nepal .'
p3015
aS'one of the responsibilities is ensuring the inclusion of myanmar in the saarc nations and try to rid the country off polio .'
p3016
aS'india is a polio-free country now .'
p3017
aS'polio cases have not been reported in the country for the past five-seven years but the disease persists in our neighbouring countries .'
p3018
aS'pakistan has reported several such cases .'
p3019
aS'whenever a member of the family suffers from polio , the entire family is rendered crippled .'
p3020
aS'this is a charitable work and we are working towards creating a plan to help our neighbouring countries rid themselves off the crippling disease .'
p3021
aS'we will obviously need to procure the necessary permissions from the respective countries and we look forward to do so in the saarc meeting where we can also discuss the plan and ensuring its effective execution .'
p3022
aS'it is a charitable deed which has always been indias usp .'
p3023
aS'we have always been recognised for our charitable work towards humanity .'
p3024
aS'we would constantly strive to excel and not left behind in this space which has always been our strength .'
p3025
aS'india has recently launched a campaign called make in india where we are beckoning entrepreneurs from around the world to come to india and partake in the benefits of the industrial development .'
p3026
aS'india is a country of opportunities and possibilities in addition to being the youngest country in the world .'
p3027
aS'our workforce constitutes largely of the youth and we want to exploit this resource to touch newer heights of development .'
p3028
aS'in three days here , i have had the opportunity to meet a lot of leaders from around the globe .'
p3029
aS'my experience in this country has been very pleasant .'
p3030
aS'the manner in which the government and people of this country have planned and executed this welcoming ceremony is indeed commendable .'
p3031
aS'i feel sorry that i wasnt able to spend some more time with all of you but i am really impressed with the manner in which with discipline you have made use of the limited time to the optimum .'
p3032
aS'i will praise your organizational ability of the disciplined manner in which the ceremony was executed , everywhere i go .'
p3033
aS'i am very thankful to you all !'
p3034
aa(lp3035
S'your excellency president thein sein , excellencies , let me , at the outset , congratulate you and thank you and the people of myanmar for the excellent arrangements and for the warm hospitality , for which this beautiful country is well known .'
p3036

aS'indian investors , too , are coming here in growing numbers and commitments .'
p3292
aS'honourable members , this is an age rich in promise , but also filled with challenges .'
p3293
aS'we can only pursue our dreams , if we have the confidence that our cities are safe , our nations are secure , our region is stable and our world is peaceful .'
p3294
aS'this vast region has many unsettled questions and new challenges .'
p3295
aS'historical differences persist despite growing inter-dependence .'
p3296
aS'the oceans are our lifelines .'
p3297
aS'but , we worry about its access and security in our part of the world more than ever before .'
p3298
aS'our region has seen huge progress on the foundation of peace and stability .'
p3299
aS'but , we can not take this for granted .'
p3300
aS'preserving it will be the most important task in the region .'
p3301
aS'india and australia can play their part in it - by expanding our security cooperation and deepening our international partnerships in the region .'
p3302
aS'but , we do not have to rely on borrowed architecture of the past .'
p3303
aS'nor do we have the luxury to choose who we work with and who we dont .'
p3304
aS'but , what we do need is to work together and with others to create environment and culture that promotes the currency of co-existence and cooperation ; in which all nations , small and big , abide by international law and norms , even when they have bitter disputes .'
p3305
aS'we should collaborate more on maintaining maritime security .'
p3306
aS'we should work together on the seas and collaborate in international forums .'
p3307
aS'and , we should work for a universal respect for international law and global norms .'
p3308
aS'we must also support the process of economic integration across the region and an open global trading system that remains integrated .'
p3309
aS'we must guard against regional trade initiatives becoming instruments of political competition .'
p3310
aS'however , economic integration by itself wont be a strong basis for peace and stability , without strong regional institutions .'
p3311
aS'india and australia are members of several institutions that are critical for this region and the world .'
p3312
aS'we should coordinate more closely in east asia summit , g20 and the indian ocean region association .'
p3313
aS'honorable members , in our inter-connected world , our shared challenges extend beyond our region .'
p3314
aS'terrorism has become a major threat for us all .'
p3315
aS'in india , we have seen its face closely for three decades .'
p3316
aS'and , we see it with the clarity that comes with it .'
p3317
aS'terrorism is changing in character and expanding in its reach .'
p3318
aS'internet has made recruitment and call to violence self-generated .'
p3319
aS'it also feeds off money laundering , drug trafficking and arms smuggling .'
p3320
aS'we have to deepen our bilateral security cooperation .'
p3321
aS'but , we need a comprehensive global strategy for a global problem .'
p3322
aS'it will require closer security cooperation ; but , even more , a policy of no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between nations ; a resolve to isolate those who harbour terrorists , willingness to empower states that will fight them ; a social movement against extremism in countries where it is most prevalent ; and , every effort to delink religion and terrorism .'
p3323
aS'as i look to the future , we would also need to ensure that outer space and cyber space remain instruments of connectivity and prosperity , not new frontiers of conflict .'
p3324
aS'responding to the regions disasters , combating proliferation , acting against piracy , we can work together on a full range of security challenges .'
p3325
aS'honorable members , since my government entered office , no region has seen more intense engagement on indias part than asia pacific region - because we understand how deeply our future is linked to this region .'
p3326
aS'india and australia can play cricket hard with each other and i suspect we will next month .'
p3327
aS'but we see australia as one of our foremost partners in the region .'
p3328
aS'i was pleased to host prime minister tony abbott as my first state guest in september .'
p3329
aS'it has taken a prime minister of india 28 years to come to australia .'
p3330
aS'it should never have been so .'
p3331
aS'and , this will change .'
p3332
aS'australia will not be at the periphery of our vision , but at the centre of our thought .'
p3333
aS'so , we stand together at a moment of enormous opportunity and great responsibility .'
p3334
aS'i see a great future of partnership between india and australia and , a shared commitment to realize it .'
p3335
aS'prime minister abbott started us on this new journey in september .'

p3375
aS'today , i stand here , grateful for this special gift the honour to be among you , to speak to this new parliament , in celebration of democracy and to reaffirm our friendship .'
p3376
aS'india is a nation of more than a billion ; fiji a nation of a million .'
p3377
aS'we are located in different oceans .'
p3378
aS'but , what unites today is our democracy , the diversity of our societies , our creed that all human beings are equal , and our commitment to the liberty , dignity and rights of every individual .'
p3379
aS'what also links today is that we have women as speakers of our two parliaments !'
p3380
aS'you have done better than us .'
p3381
aS'one in every seven members in this parliament is a woman ; in india , it is just one in nine .'
p3382
aS'so , i hope we can match you the next time ; and , i hope we can both do better in future .'
p3383
aS'people in fiji have different histories , ethnicities , languages and religions .'
p3384
aS'but , they stand together as one nation of fijians , with one voice , one vision and one aspiration .'
p3385
aS'in both nations , we have vested power in our people .'
p3386
aS"your constitution begins with  we , the people of fiji '' , ours begins with the same simple words ,  we the people of india '' and , what a constitution you have framed !"
p3387
aS'it is a constitution that only not only guarantees freedoms and rights the citizens , but also to ensure their basic needs and empower them .'

p3391
aS'honorable members , fiji is a shining example of small nations that can successfully pursue great ambitions , because what makes a nation successful is not its size or its population , but its vision and its values .'

p3393
aS'you have been a strong voice on behalf of the pacific islands and a hub of this region .'

aS'honorable members , for india , fiji will always have a special place .'
p3399
aS'the tide of history brought many from india to your shores .'
p3400
aS'it has forged our ties of culture and kinship .'
p3401
aS'but , our relationship today stands on a much broader of our shared values and our common interests as developing countries .'
p3402
aS'and , now , together we were partners in making history .'
p3403
aS'you graciously hosted indian scientists in fiji for tracking our mars mission , mangalyaan .'
p3404
aS'it was the only mission in the world to succeed in the first attempt .'
p3405
aS'i convey today the gratitude of the people and the scientists of india .'
p3406
aS'this simple yet profound act of cooperation reflects the boundless possibilities in our relationship , if we choose to seek them .'
p3407
aS'our trade and investment ties have been modest .'
p3408
aS'our relationship in science , education and culture could be stronger .'
p3409
aS'yet , there are examples of our partnership that should inspire us our cooperation in upgrading your sugar mills or the public-private partnership in the area of healthcare .'
p3410
aS'as we have collaborated in running hospitals here , we can also extend our cooperation in pharmaceuticals and traditional medicines .'
p3411
aS'as fiji adjusts to the changing global markets , india is prepared to be your partner in making your existing industry stronger and finding new opportunities for your youth .'
p3412
aS'for countries like ours , village and small and medium scale industries are the source of enterprise and employment .'

p3422
aS'in this digital age , every nation can be part of the global information technology industry .'
p3423
aS'and , it is a dream that youth around the world share .'
p3424
aS'it is an industry that depends on ideas and skills .'

p3430
aS'today , i propose that we work together to harness the potential of space technology for governance , economic development , conservation , climate change and natural disasters .'
p3431
aS'we could work to make fiji the hub for our regional collaboration in space , just as india has done with asean .'
p3432
aS'there are times when we think of each other as distant lands , separated by oceans and seven time zones .'
p3433
aS'but , think of the days when travel was difficult .'
p3434
aS'that did not deter brave people from travelling over the seas in search of a new life .'
p3435
aS'distance , to me , is irrelevant in a world of fiber optic cables and satellite links .'
p3436
aS'we are only as far away as the click of a mouse or the call button of a phone .'
p3437
aS'in any case , a direct flight today can take you from fiji to most places in india .'
p3438
aS'and , i say this more to my people than to you .'
p3439
aS'fijians have been steady in visiting india .'
p3440
aS'we in india have not paid enough attention to this beautiful land of warm people and immense potential .'
p3441
aS'this must change .'
p3442
aS'we must make travel easier between our two countries .'
p3443
aS'for this reason , i have taken a small step in extending visa on arrival to fijians in india , as you have done for indians .'
p3444
aS'and , if you want to attract more indians to enjoy the magnificence of your islands and the warmth of your hospitality , you should invite bollywood to shoot their films in fiji .'
p3445
aS'honourable members of parliament , we have spoken of vast opportunities , but we also share many common challenges .'
p3446
aS'for you , climate change is not a matter of debate , but a basic question of existence .'
p3447
aS'india , too , is a nation of a long coastline and more than 1000 islands , a nation that is nurtured by monsoon rain and the himalayan glaciers .'
p3448
aS'we , too , are facing the searing impact of climate change .'
p3449
aS'and , we spend more than 6 % of our gdp in adapting to its consequences .'
p3450
aS'now , each of us must shoulder our own responsibilities .'
p3451
aS'we can not side aside and take no action .'
p3452
aS'technology has made it possible .'
p3453
aS'we dont have to seek old pathways to prosperity .'
p3454
aS'in india , we have a comprehensive national plan and strategy to both mitigate and adapt to climate change .'
p3455
aS'and , i have a deep personal commitment to it .'
p3456
aS'and , we look forward to working with fiji in areas such wind and solar energy .'
p3457
aS'but , it is also equally important that the global community accepts its responsibility and implements its commitment .'
p3458
aS'it should not become one in which the strong shift the burden on the others ; or impose the responsibilities of their excesses on the choices that others make .'
p3459
aS'it should not be an issue of economic advantage or trade competitive of one over the other .'
p3460
aS'the world had agreed on a beautiful balance of collective action common but differentiated responsibilities .'
p3461
aS'that should form the basis of continued action .'
p3462
aS'this also means that the developed countries must fulfil their commitments for funding and technology transfer .'
p3463
aS'india has stood shoulder to shoulder with fiji and the small islands developing states is seeking a fair and urgent response from the international community for a sustainable future .'
p3464
aS'we also have shared stakes in a peaceful , cooperative and prosperous asia and pacific regions .'
p3465
aS'stretching from the indian ocean through continental asia into pacific , this is a region of enormous dynamism and opportunities , but also a region with many challenges .'
p3466
aS'fiji is a leader in the region and a strong voice in the developing world .'
p3467
aS'together , we can also work for a future in the region , in which there is an equal place for all nations - big and small , developed and developing and a climate of peace and tranquility .'
p3468
aS'i thank prime minister and fiji for their leadership in hosting my meeting with the pacific leaders later today .'

aS'let us chart a new course .'
p3473
aS'let us start a new era - when it does not take another 33 years for an indian prime minister to visit fiji .'

aS'i am confident that this visit , especially my meeting with prime minister bainimarama , will mark the start of a new era india-fiji relations .'
p3565
aS'i am looking forward to the rest of my day here , including the honour of addressing the parliament .'
p3566
aa(lp3567
S'prime minister sushil koiralaji , my colleagues from south asiai am delighted to return to kathmandu .'
p3568
aS'koiralaji , congratulations on organising an excellent summitthank you , nepal , for your warm hospitality once again .'
p3569
aS'greetings to the observer countries present here .'
p3570
aS'this is my first saarc .'
p3571
aS'but , this is the second time i am meeting most of you together .'
p3572
aS'i stepped into the office with the greetings of the entire world .'
p3573
aS'but , what moved me , dear colleagues , was your personal presence , with the good wishes of one-fourth of humanity .'
p3574
aS'because the future i dream for india is the future i wish for our entire region .'
p3575
aS'the last summit was three years ago .'
p3576
aS'only two of us here were present in addu .'
p3577
aS'even prime minister sheikh hasina has come here after her re-election .'
p3578
aS'president rajapaksa will soon go into one and i wish him good luck .'
p3579
aS'i especially welcome our newest colleague , president ghani .'
p3580
aS'ours is a region of thriving democracy ; of rich inheritance ; the unmatched strength of youth ; and , a strong thirst for change and progress .'
p3581
aS'in the last few months , i have travelled around the world .'
p3582
aS'from the middle of the pacific , to the southern coast of atlantic ocean , i see a rising tide of integration .'
p3583
aS'and , negotiations on major trade agreements such as regional comprehensive economic partnership , the trans pacific partnership and the trans atlantic trade and investment partnership .'
p3584
aS'because the barriers of boundaries inhibit progress ; international partnerships add speed to it .'
p3585
aS'because , in the life of an individual or a nation , a good neighbourhood is a universal aspiration .'
p3586
aS'where does south asia wish to stand in this world ?'
p3587
aS'nowhere in the world are collective efforts more urgent than in south asia ; and , nowhere else is it so modest .'
p3588
aS'big and small , we face the same challenges - a long climb to the summit of development .'
p3589
aS'but , i have great belief in our boundless potential .'
p3590
aS'and , confidence - that comes from the many inspiring stories of innovation and initiative in each of our countries .'
p3591
aS'there is much to learn from each other ; even more - to do together .'
p3592
aS'that was the vision and aspiration that brought us together as saarc 30 years ago .'
p3593
aS'we have travelled a long distance together since then .'
p3594
aS'we have an agreement , an institution or a framework of cooperation in every field .'
p3595
aS'we also have many successes .'
p3596
aS'yet , when we speak of saarc , we usually hear two reactions cynicism and scepticism .'
p3597
aS'this , sadly , is in a region throbbing with the optimism of our youth .'
p3598
aS'today , less than 5 % of the regions global trade takes place between us .'
p3599
aS'even at this modest level , less than 10 % of the regions internal trade takes place under saarc free trade area .'
p3600
aS'indian companies are investing billions abroad , but less than 1 % flow into our region .'
p3601
aS'it is still harder to travel within our region than to bangkok or singapore ; and , more expensive to speak to each other .'
p3602
aS'how much have we done in saarc to turn our natural wealth into shared prosperity ; or , our borders into bridgeheads to a shared future ?'
p3603
aS'yet , south asia is slowly coming together .'
p3604
aS'india and bangladesh have deepened their links through rail , road , power and transit .'
p3605
aS'india and nepal have started a new era of cooperation in energy ; and , india and bhutan are making those ties stronger by the day .'
p3606
aS'with sri lanka , we have transformed trade through a free trade agreement .'
p3607
aS'we will soon launch a new arrangement to meet maldives need for oil .'
p3608
aS'distance and difficulties have not held back india and afghanistan .'
p3609
aS'and , bus and train sustain contacts between people in india and pakistanwe have given five south asian partners duty free access to 99.'
p3610
aS'7 % of their goods and are prepared to do more with others .'
p3611
aS'for india , it has been a privilege to provide assistance of nearly 8 billion u .'
p3612
aS's.'
p3613
aS'dollars in south asia over a decade .'
p3614
aS'it may not seem a great amount in these times , but we are grateful for the opportunity to have made a difference to the lives of a few brothers and sisters in our region .'
p3615
aS'each of us has taken our initiatives .'
p3616
aS'however , as saarc we have failed to move with the speed that our people expect and want .'
p3617
aS'some argue that it is because of the regions development gap .'
p3618
aS'but , that should actually spur us to do more .'
p3619
aS'or , is it because we are stuck behind the walls of our differences and hesitant to move out of the shadows of the past ?'
p3620
aS'this wont resolve our differences , but will certainly deprive us of opportunities .'
p3621
aS'today , goods travel from one punjab to the other punjab through delhi , mumbai , dubai and karachi making the journey eleven times longer and the cost four times more .'
p3622
aS'india , too , has its share of responsibility because of our size and location .'
p3623
aS'i know that many of your goods , too , have to do a parikrama of india to reach their destinations .'
p3624
aS'just think of what we are doing to our consumers - and to our environment !'
p3625
aS'we must shrink the distance between our producers and consumers and use the most direct routes of trade .'
p3626
aS'i know india has to lead , and we will do our part hope , each of you will , too .'
p3627
aS'infrastructure is our regions greatest weakness and its most pressing need .'
p3628
aS'when i thought of coming to kathmandu by road , it made many officials in india nervous .'
p3629
aS'because of the condition of roads at the border !'
p3630
aS'infrastructure is my greatest priority in india .'
p3631
aS'and , i also want to set up a special purpose facility in india to finance infrastructure projects in our region that enhances our connectivity and trade .'
p3632
aS'we speak of ease of doing business in india .'
p3633
aS'lets extend this to our region .'
p3634
aS'i promise to ensure that our facilities at the border will speed up , not slow down , trade .'
p3635
aS'lets all make our procedures simple , our facilities better , our standards common and our paper work less burdensome .'
p3636
aS'india will now give business visa for 3-5 years for saarc .'
p3637
aS'lets make it even easier for our businesses through a saarc business traveller card .'
p3638
aS'excellencies , india has a huge trade surplus with saarc countries .'
p3639
aS'i believe that this neither right nor sustainable .'
p3640
aS'we will address your concerns and give you a level playing field in india .'
p3641
aS'but , i encourage you to attract indian investments to produce for the indian market and create jobs for your youth .'
p3642
aS'i also look to a future when your companies can easily raise funds in india for investments at home ; and , when we have cross-border industrial corridors , so that we can take advantage of the natural synergies and connected lives in our border states .'
p3643
aS'i also believe that if we can light up each others towns and villages , we can build a brighter tomorrow for our region .'
p3644
aS'or , face a future when someone looks down at us from space , and says that this is worlds darkest corner .'
p3645
aS'let us treat electricity as a commodity like any other that we invest and trade in .'
p3646
aS'india will fully support these initiatives in the region .'
p3647
aS'we should also think with ambition to use solar energy and micro grids to quickly provide clean power to villages across the region .'
p3648
aS'our relations become stronger when we connect the lives of the ordinary citizens of our countries .'
p3649
aS'that is why connectivity and services by rail and road are so important .'
p3650
aS'we should also connect ourselves more by air .'
p3651
aS'we will not only make a difference to the lives of our people but also promote tourism in the regionwe should use the strength of shared heritage and our diversity - to encourage tourism within our region , and present south asia to the world .'
p3652
aS'we could begin with the buddhist circuit , but we dont have to stop there .'
p3653
aS'as we seek to build bridges to prosperity , we must not lose sight of our responsibility to the millions living without hope .'
p3654
aS'we must work with our compassion of our hearts , but also with the power of science .'
p3655
aS'in the area of health , india will meet the shortfall in funds to establish the saarc regional supra reference laboratory for tb and hiv .'
p3656
aS'we offer the five-in-one vaccine for the children of south asia .'
p3657
aS'we will support monitoring and surveillance of polio-free countries , and provide vaccines where it might reappear .'
p3658
aS'and , for those coming to india for medical treatment , india will provide immediate medical visa for the patient and one attendant .'
p3659
aS'information technology has removed all barriers to quality education .'
p3660
aS'india is prepared to connect our south asian students through online course and e-libraries .'
p3661
aS'when we set up indias national knowledge network , we will be happy to extend it to the saarc region .'
p3662
aS'the dream of a south asian university has become a reality in new delhi .'
p3663
aS'but , to be truly south asian , it must also have partnerships with at least one university in each saarc country .'
p3664
aS'excellencies , indias gift of a satellite for the saarc region will benefit us all in areas like education , telemedicine , disaster response , resource management , weather forecasting and communication .'
p3665
aS'we will also host a conference in india for all south asian partners next year , to strengthen our collective ability to apply space technology in economic development and governance .'
p3666
aS'and , we plan to launch our satellite by the saarc day in 2016.'
p3667
aS'as neighbours , we should also be together in good and bad times .'
p3668
aS'indias capability and expertise in disaster management will always be available to south asia .'
p3669
aS'equally , as we reach out to our indians caught in conflicts and disasters around the world , we will also be there for all our south asian citizens .'
p3670
aS'excellencies , a prosperous saarc needs the strong foundation of a secure south asia .'
p3671
aS'if we are sensitive to each others security , and the lives of our people , we will deepen friendships , spur cooperation and advance stability in our region .'
p3672
aS'today , as we remember the horror of the terror attack in mumbai in 2008 , we feel the endless pain of lost lives .'
p3673
aS'let us work together to fulfil the pledge we have taken to combat terrorism and trans-national crimes .'
p3674
aS'for india , our vision for the region rests on five pillars trade , investment , assistance , cooperation in every area , contacts between our people and , all through seamless connectivity .'
p3675
aS'this is the call of our times .'
p3676
aS'this is the age of social media , where boundaries matter little .'
p3677
aS'there is a new awakening in south asia ; a new recognition of inter-linked destinies ; and , a new belief in shared opportunities .'
p3678
aS'the bonds will flow .'
p3679
aS'through saarc or outside it .'
p3680
aS'among us all or some of us .'
p3681
aS'we can all choose our paths to our destinations .'
p3682
aS'but , when we join our hands and walk in step , the path becomes easier , the journey quicker and the destination closer .'
p3683
aS'i say this as much to my government and people , as i say to you .'
p3684
aS'we are meeting in the lap of himalaya , which has nurtured us through the ages .'
p3685
aS'today , it is calling us to act .'
p3686
aS'let us work to change cynicism into optimism .'
p3687
aS'let us turn south asia of flowering hope into a rich field of peace and prosperity .'
p3688
aa(lp3689
S'my dear brothers and sisters of guwahati who have gathered here in large numberstoday is an important event in the history of railways .'
p3690
aS'one more of the indian states are going to be connected through rail network .'
p3691
aS'today , a new route from mendipathar in meghalaya to guwahati in assam gets connected by rail .'
p3692
aS'also there is yet another occasion for the railways as the foundation for a new rail route from bhairabi to sairang in mizoram will be laid .'
p3693
aS'so both these projects where one rail route is being opened up and foundation for another is being laid presents a unique occasion .'
p3694
aS'there are those of us who believe in vaastu though i must confess that i do not know much about it .'
p3695
aS'but if i were to believe what the experts say then the north east corner of the house should be well kept .'
p3696
aS'it should be clean and its sanctity should be maintained at all times .'
p3697
aS'if this is done the house will forever prosper .'
p3698
aS'well , i can not verify these claims but what i do know is that if we are able to take care of the north east india , the ishan corner of our homeland , then the entire india will prosper .'
p3699
aS'so if we want india to prosper , the progress of the north east will need to be fast tracked .'
p3700
aS'the first step in this direction will be the development of infrastructure .'
p3701
aS'those who are futuristic and have a great vision always start with the development of infrastructure .'
p3702
aS'once infrastructure is developed then the people themselves take development forward .'
p3703
aS'many of you must have heard about south korea .'
p3704
aS'it is a small country with a population of about 5-6 crores .'
p3705
aS'it is along the sea coast .'
p3706
aS'it was a very poor country .'
p3707
aS'we talk about the poverty in india but think of a country poorer than india .'
p3708
aS'but the rulers there thought of building a highway at par with international standards right in the middle of the country .'
p3709
aS'this became a hugely controversial decision .'
p3710
aS'people were angry that they had no food , the children had no access to education , they had no homes to live yet their ruler was thinking of spending hundreds of crores of on construction of a road .'
p3711
aS'but their ruler was a man of grit and determination .'
p3712
aS'he went ahead with his plans and built the road despite the criticism .'
p3713
aS'and that one road changed the face of the entire nation .'
p3714
aS'a few years back we too hosted the commonwealth games .'
p3715
aS'we are a large country but what did we do ?'
p3716
aS'whatever happened in delhi , the negative publicity and the disgrace that followed is known to one and all .'
p3717
aS'that same small country of south korea was able to hold olympics in their country about 12-15 years back and host a worldwide audience .'
p3718
aS'that nation prospered and poverty was eradicated .'
p3719
aS'and how did they achieve that , by just one road that opened the doors of prosperity for them .'
p3720
aS'the american president kennedy said , it is not wealth that creates roads but it is the roads that lead to the creation of wealth .'
p3721
aS'in the plans for development , infrastructure occupies a significant place .'
p3722
aS'if the north east has to develop and play an important role in the development of india , then infrastructure development should be a priority .'
p3723
aS'it is my firm belief that these 8 north eastern states , our ashta lakshmi , ( eight goddesses of wealth ) have the potential of bringing in prosperity for the entire nation .'
p3724
aS'if these eight states are connected to the nations infrastructure which includes roads , rail and all other types of connectivity , if we are successful in doing so which i am sure we will then there will be no looking back .'
p3725
aS'there is a new higher middle class which takes family vacations once or twice each year .'
p3726
aS'they are always scouting for new destinations .'
p3727
aS'with better connectivity north east will become the heaven which every tourist desires .'
p3728
aS'the beautiful landscapes , the dense jungles and above all the warmth of the people here will make it the most sought after destination and i am sure that people from all over india will be thronging the place .'
p3729
aS'and with this thought of developing the north east , our new government that has been recently formed , in its first budget itself allocated a sum of rs .'
p3730
aS'28,000 crores for the development of rail network in the region .'
p3731
aS'i have a firm belief that once this network is laid my people will themselves take this region to new unprecedented heights of progress and development .'
p3732
aS'in the changing world scenario , it is believed that this century belongs to asia .'
p3733
aS'and if this is a century of asia then have we made any preparations ?'
p3734
aS'there is an emphasis on look east policy .'
p3735
aS'we believe that if this century belongs to asia then we are definitely going to make the most of it .'
p3736
aS'and how do we intend to achieve it ?'
p3737
aS'not just by following look east but by following look east act east policy .'
p3738
aS'and we are now moving form just look east to act east policy .'
p3739
aS'it is our effort that north east gets connected by road and rail to myanmar and other east asian countries .'
p3740
aS'if this is achieved , this region will become the centre of trade and commerce .'
p3741
aS'this region will hold the potential for redefining progress .'
p3742
aS'and then , the youth of north east will not have to leave their homeland endowed with natural wealth and go elsewhere to big cities in search of livelihood .'
p3743
aS'times are changing and so we have to move forward with new concept of infrastructural development .'
p3744
aS'the infrastructure too needs to be with ethos of next generation .'
p3745
aS'in the past building rail , road , ports and airports was perceived by the people a lot was done .'
p3746
aS'but now the world is changing .'
p3747
aS'now highways are required as are i-ways .'
p3748
aS'information ways , i-ways .'
p3749
aS'there is no place for a digital divide .'
p3750
aS'north east should be an integral part of the digital india dream .'
p3751
aS'it should have both i-ways network and connectivity .'
p3752
aS'the facilities should be such that whatever one is able to achieve sitting in delhi same should be available to a person living in the difficult terrains of the north east .'
p3753
aS'the world is changing .'
p3754
aS'why shouldnt there be gas grid ?'
p3755
aS'why shouldnt there be access to 24 hours of fresh water supply ?'
p3756
aS'why shouldnt there be electricity supply round the clock ?'
p3757
aS'why shouldnt there be an optical fibre network ?'
p3758
aS'we have to develop infrastructure keeping the new and changing times in mind .'
p3759
aS'this concept of next generation infrastructure development for a modern india should be conducted at a fast pace and should be actualized as soon as possible .'
p3760
aS'the children of north east are educated in english .'
p3761
aS'if there is proper optical fibre coverage and smooth connectivity then the youth of north east can do the same job work from home in their own village as is being done in hyderabad and bangalore .'
p3762
aS'they do not need to go to delhi and bombay for call centre jobs .'
p3763
aS'this can happen in north east itself .'
p3764
aS'this world here can change hence i am taking a special interest in the development of the north east .'
p3765
aS'a few days back i had visited myanmar .'
p3766
aS'i had discussions with the heads of state regarding improved connectivity , improved trade and greater utilization of the local human resource .'
p3767
aS'dear brothers and sisters , this rail connectivity is not only about passengers commuting from one place to another .'
p3768
aS'it is a medium that connects us , gives us pace and speed and also provides us strength .'
p3769
aS'the indian railways have the potential to become the backbone of all economic activities .'
p3770
aS'but instead of considering it as the energetic force of economic development we have made it completely insignificant .'
p3771
aS'nobody from the parliament or the nation ever pays attention to the discussions of the railway budget .'
p3772
aS'the moment railway minister starts speaking , the statements that are greeted with applause are the ones related to increase in number of coaches or extension of some route or upgradation of some station .'
p3773
aS'we have divided railways in such small parts .'
p3774
aS'we should not be satisfied if a coach is added and applaud it or feel happy if a new route is opened .'
p3775
aS'we will not be satisfied with these petty gains .'
p3776
aS'we have to both expand railways and also modernize it .'
p3777
aS'we are aiming at both horizontal and vertical expansion of the railways .'
p3778
aS'by horizontal expansion i mean expanding its reach to every nook and corner of the country .'
p3779
aS'by vertical expansion i mean the upgradation of services which involves technology upgradation , speed enhancement to save time and enhancement of facilities .'
p3780
aS'it will be our endeavour to see that railways truly become an engine facilitating the economic growth of the nation in true sense .'
p3781
aS'i have complete faith that under the dynamic leadership of our new rail minister , mr suresh prabhu railway will witness many fold progress in comparison to the progress made in the past 100 years .'
p3782
aS'for the first time in the countrys history we have made a decision that of 100 % foreign direct investment .'
p3783
aS'we are looking at 100 % foreign investment in the railways .'
p3784
aS'people will come , invest money , create moderns trains , create modern rail lines , modern signaling system will be implemented , modern ticketing system will be put in place the entire railway system will be modernised .'
p3785
aS'in a country of 125 million everyone has been a passenger some or the other time .'
p3786
aS'some people travel once a year and some people travel many times in the same day but the underlying fact is that everyone travels .'
p3787
aS'so you can imagine the large commercial market that exists .'
p3788
aS'we can also strive towards making eco friendly and environment friendly railways .'
p3789
aS'thus we can play an important role in the fight against global warming arising out of mass transportation .'
p3790
aS'there are many facets which we want to involve in the creation of new systems using the railways .'
p3791
aS'the entire functioning of the railways involves expertise , dedicated technology and continuous technology upgradation and for this human resources are required .'
p3792
aS'currently the railways advertise for vacancies and the people apply for jobs .'
p3793
aS'those who qualify for the interviews are subsequently trained for the services .'
p3794
aS'we have thought of a new version which i am sure the new generation will definitely like .'
p3795
aS'i have suggested establishing railway university in four corners of the country .'
p3796
aS'it will have all the courses and also courses dedicated to the functioning of railways .'
p3797
aS'thus on passing out , the youth will immediately find an employment opportunity with the railways .'
p3798
aS'human resource development along with technology upgradation , improvement in speed and management , improvement in facilities and delivery of services - this is our agenda .'
p3799
aS'our railway stations which exist right in the heart of big cities extend for miles .'
p3800
aS'land today is a major premium .'
p3801
aS'but our railway stations continue to be the same as they were a hundred years back .'
p3802
aS'same chairs and benches to sit , same services to the passengers .'
p3803
aS'but cant this all be changed ?'
p3804
aS'we have asked for the railway stations to be privatised .'
p3805
aS'the trains keep running below and above them five star , seven star hotels , motels or malls can be erected .'
p3806
aS'the sky above the train is open so utilize it for income generation and enhance the services delivered at the railway stations- this is what i have explained to them .'
p3807
aS'railways have taken a call for the modernisation of some railway platforms .'
p3808
aS'i hold the view that railway platform should be better than the airports .'
p3809
aS'because railway platform is used by the poorest of poor , the common man as well as a labourer hence the services at the railway platform have to change .'
p3810
aS'you will see that within no time i will create 10 -12 model stations .'
p3811
aS'once this is attained , then the entire country will follow and our work will gain momentum .'
p3812
aS'brothers and sisters , we have to bring about a dramatic change in the railways .'
p3813
aS'our endeavour should be to be the best in the world and for that whatever new technology is required we will bring it in .'
p3814
aS'by connecting the north east , this ashta lakshmi of india by rail we intend to make this region the most prosperous in india .'
p3815
aS'we are working in that direction .'
p3816
aS'i congratulate the railway officials and give them my best wishes .'
p3817
aS'i congratulate the rail ministry and the new rail minister who will take this forward at a great speed .'
p3818
aS'i congratulate the people of meghalaya and mizoram .'
p3819
aS'i thank the governor and chief minister from all my heart .'
p3820
aS'let us all work to take our nation to new heights and our idea of progress should entail development for all , no region should be left behind .'
p3821
aS'let us move forward with the notion that development touches one and all , is inclusive and all encompassing , is fulfilling for everyone and extends everywhere .'
p3822
aS'in taking this development forward , i thank everybody for their contribution .'
p3823
aS'i express my gratitude to shri tarun ji .'
p3824
aS'thank you .'
p3825
aa(lp3826
S'my colleague in the council of ministers shri rajnath singh ji , all the honourable chief ministers of northeast , shri kiran rijiju ji and all the officers and leaders of the police force .'
p3827
aS'i heartily congratulate all those who have been honoured today .'
p3828
aS'since the times of chanakya , we have studied what is vital for nations security , more than having advantage of good weaponry ; it depends on who has those weapons .'
p3829
aS'but even more important than having weaponry and trained manpower handling those weaponry , is having the best intelligence network ; as the success of any nations security depends on it .'
p3830
aS'the system that has the best form of intelligence will never require either the weapon holder or weaponry and there definitely wont be any need of use of weapons .'
p3831
aS'if there is any unit that holds utmost importance in terms of nations security , it is the intelligence system .'
p3832
aS'i have been privileged enough to honour the officers serving in this arena .'
p3833
aS'i would like to once again congratulate them for their excellent service .'
p3834
aS'everyone is surprised that the tradition of holding this conference in new delhi since so many years has been discontinued and the ceremony has been shifted from delhi to guwahati .'
p3835
aS'but you must have noticed that when you come to delhi for a meeting , you come there with a lot of work .'
p3836
aS'you feel that since we have come all the way to delhi , you might as well get with a few other things done like visit the ministry , meet the secretaries .'
p3837
aS'but now you need to concentrate a little on the issues faced by the state .'
p3838
aS'now the meeting is out of delhi and hence from the time you have come here , you must have been well acquainted with each other .'
p3839
aS'there is no other activity here , so the entire focus will be on the ongoing activity .'
p3840
aS'and the one to benefit the most would be the people of northeast , the police force here would be very happy and encouraged and this would also help you understand how big result a minor change can bring about .'
p3841
aS'it is possible that later in life you also take this initiative .'
p3842
aS'this is an auspicious beginning .'
p3843
aS'in the future too we want such events to take place outside delhi in different states .'
p3844
aS'i am sure delhi will also get a chance ; it is not that delhi will never host such meets anymore .'
p3845
aS'but when the programme is held in delhi , there is no role played by the delhi police .'
p3846
aS'the indian government and vigyan bhavan are ready with your accommodation , where you stay in your quarters and then leave .'
p3847
aS'this is a change and every system of change needs to have a life .'
p3848
aS'robotic systems do not work .'
p3849
aS'systems should be alive and full of life .'
p3850
aS'systems should encourage and augment the liveliness and this change will lead you in that direction .'
p3851
aS'i am sure you will also adopt similar experiments in your state .'
p3852
aS'you have been here since yesterday and there have been talks - some of serious nature and there have been some light conversations .'
p3853
aS'even i am going to be with you till today afternoon .'
p3854
aS'i want to spend maximum time listening to you .'
p3855
aS'but there are a few things that i want to express today .'
p3856
aS'after our countrys independence , the fact that 33 thousand policemen have sacrificed their lives while protecting the country and safeguarding the comforts of its citizens , is by no means , a minor feat .'
p3857
aS'but does the entire police force know that 33 thousand policemen have sacrificed their lives to protect the country ?'
p3858
aS'how would then the common citizens of india know about this fact ?'
p3859
aS'i feel it is of prime importance that this sacrifice does not go waste .'
p3860
aS'how can their respect get enhanced in the society ?'
p3861
aS'he also must have been someones son .'
p3862
aS'and he has died in the line of duty and i do not know why we have not shown enough concern towards them .'
p3863
aS'i would want a small taskforce to be formed from amongst you , consisting of some senior and experienced people .'
p3864
aS'we should be able to find out ways to incorporate the positives from the heritage of this sacrifice in a manner such that it is embedded as our inspiration forever .'
p3865
aS'a protocol also has to be set up to honour them during their last rites .'
p3866
aS'every state has its own police academy where the new recruits are trained .'
p3867
aS'i want to know if their syllabus can include a thorough knowledge comprised in a comprehensive book based on the life of all those who have sacrificed their lives from that region .'
p3868
aS'every state should have its own book - an official government book .'
p3869
aS'who has sacrificed their life , at what occasion , how did they lose their life in the line of duty , what courage did they show and how many lives they did they save ; all should be mentioned in the book .'
p3870
aS'the new generation of police , the new constables who are under training , will learn these things .'
p3871
aS'he will have to read this book too and answer an exam on the same .'
p3872
aS'through this , he will realise of the martyrdom of those before him who sacrificed their lives .'
p3873
aS'this will then be passed on through the generations .'
p3874
aS'should we bring out a new edition of the book every year ?'
p3875
aS'we can decide now that every state publishes an e-book that mentions the martyrdom of all these 33 thousand martyrs with their photos which can be sourced from their families .'
p3876
aS'it should be in the regional and national language .'
p3877
aS'this will be a small effort but one with huge repercussions in form of the inspiration .'
p3878
aS'i have also noticed that the police department holds a lot of programmes for police welfare .'
p3879
aS'cine stars are a part of these programmes and performances and plays are also a part of it .'
p3880
aS'it is done in a grand way in mumbai .'
p3881
aS'during this time , a souvenir is also issued .'
p3882
aS'advertisement is asked for and funds are collected .'
p3883
aS'i have not gone into the details , nor do i wish to .'
p3884
aS'but can we decide to include a list of those who have sacrificed their lives in that particular year in the souvenir , speaking of their deeds .'
p3885
aS'we shouldnt let their lives go waste in this manner .'
p3886
aS'he may not be physically alive , but for the police force and the society , he should never die .'
p3887
aS'it is our responsibility .'
p3888
aS'i dont want to discuss if something similar has happened in the past but something like this should happen now as i believe it will make a huge difference .'
p3889
aS'the other thing is police welfare .'
p3890
aS'i am well aware that the police force leads a life full of stress .'
p3891
aS'he puts his life on the line of fire for his duty .'
p3892
aS'if there is no well-being and happiness in his family , how will they go on duty ?'
p3893
aS'no matter how sacrificial and selfless the police officer is , familys discomfort also causes him discomfort .'
p3894
aS'it is the role of the government and all of us to establish a system for the welfare of their families .'
p3895
aS'everything from them and their familys health check up to their childrens education should be taken care of .'
p3896
aS'how are the residential facilities of those in the lower ranks ?'
p3897
aS'someone should pay some heed to this .'
p3898
aS'and its not as if this is not happening .'
p3899
aS'a good thing now is that our home minister was a successful chief minister of one of the biggest states of our country .'
p3900
aS'and hence he knows the nuances of this topic .'
p3901
aS'his guidance will be of a lot of help to us in the coming days .'
p3902
aS'it has also been my privilege that since i was a chief minister for quite a long time and held the control of the home department , i am also aware of the way it functions .'
p3903
aS'i am aware of what goes on the ground .'
p3904
aS'and hence it might be a possibility that we are treating this on priority .'
p3905
aS'we want to approach the task of police welfare in a scientific manner and that is the bare minimum we can do .'
p3906
aS'and if we do this , then there will be a huge change .'
p3907
aS'sometimes the movies depict a policeman in a certain grey light and this goes into the minds of common man .'
p3908
aS'i have seen a very few movies that talk about the sacrifice of these policemen and that is the reason such an image of policemen has embedded in the minds of a common man .'
p3909
aS'we should make special efforts .'
p3910
aS'the indian government should make a pr agency of sorts and meet the film producers and make them aware of their deeds .'
p3911
aS'if the opinion-makers of the society wont protect the integrity of the ones who protect our country , then the rot in the system will also not go away .'
p3912
aS'if there is a kid in the family who keeps committing a mistake , we dont reprimand him for every mistake of his and instead try to point out his achievements then he on his own starts focusing on the good and developing on it .'
p3913
aS'there will be limitations , who doesnt have them ?'
p3914
aS'but there is a way to overcome these limitations with the help of the society .'
p3915
aS'i want the thought process of the country towards the policemen to change keeping the onground realities in mind .'
p3916
aS'any negative story about a policeman has a long shelf life in the media but many positive things never even come to the fore .'
p3917
aS'when i was in gujarat , i had conducted an experiment and you too can try it if you find it to be applicable .'
p3918
aS'i dont know what happened after i have left gujarat .'
p3919
aS'i dont know if they are still following that or not .'
p3920
aS'but i had made a request to every police station to build their own website where they would update their weeks best of the best social activities .'
p3921
aS'whatever the weeks positive highlight was , whether they worked towards a social cause or helped a needy and treated them with respect , saved someone from heavy losses all this would be updated on the website .'
p3922
aS'there are a lot of instances ; there is no dearth of such incidents that can be highlighted .'
p3923
aS'please dont be depressed , there are a lot of good things happening in the country due to you but if you dont bring them out in the open , no one will know about it .'
p3924
aS'we put up a positive story that is absolutely true on the website every week and see the kind of changes it brings in peoples perception towards the police .'
p3925
aS'there is no need to be artificial ; there are enough positive things to be highlighted .'
p3926
aS'every person you meet will have at least one positive story to tell about a policeman .'
p3927
aS'but such facts are not collectively presented to the people .'
p3928
aS'i want you to think on this positively and develop a plan of action to take it forward .'
p3929
aS'we will discuss this in detail when we meet .'
p3930
aS'i have a concept in my mind - that of smart police - a smart police force .'
p3931
aS'how can we work with this vision ?'
p3932
aS'when i talk about smart police i mean s - strict but also s - sensitive , police should be strict yet sensitive , m modern and there should be mobility , there should be no stagnancy , a - alert and accountable , r - reliable and responsive , t - techno savvy and trained .'
p3933
aS'we have to take these five points and march ahead .'
p3934
aS'i truly believe we can fill the police force with a new life and a renewed sense of consciousness .'
p3935
aS'once again , i would like to thank and congratulate all those whom i have had the privilege of honouring today .'
p3936
aS'in future too , the mighty police force will be successful in serving the citizens , protecting them and most importantly instilling in them a sense of faith .'
p3937
aS'the rest , we will discuss in detail when we meet .'
p3938
aS'best wishes , thank you .'
p3939
aa(lp3940
S'the chief minister was just speaking on a lot of topics - there are no roads , no hospitals and nothing of film division of any sort .'
p3941
aS'i felt satisfied to hear him discussing these problems as it made me feel that this chief minister trusts this government to change things .'
p3942
aS'and since he has such faith in my government , i feel the need to fulfill these wishes .'
p3943
aS'the porbandar-silcher road that he mentioned - i had laid the foundation stone of the road in gujarat at porbandar in the capacity of chief minister of the state during the period of atal bihari vajpayee government .'
p3944
aS'it is also possible that i come here for a similar inauguration in future .'
p3945
aS'but all the subjects that the chief minister has mentioned are important .'
p3946
aS'we too are keen on developing north east , the land of ashta lakshmi and hence we have allotted a budget of about rs 60000 crores towards the development of its infrastructure .'
p3947
aS'during the bilateral talks in myanmar on my recent visit there , the maximum impetus was on the subject of how to establish connectivity with imphal .'
p3948
aS'be it air connectivity , road connectivity or i-ways , it should benefit everyone and the government of myanmar has also taken important decisions to get associated with the infrastructure projects with the government of india so that this region can be made more accessible .'
p3949
aS'you will surely notice the results in the coming days .'
p3950
aS'today , i have had the good fortune of being here for the sangai festival .'
p3951
aS'our country has a lot of potential for tourism .'
p3952
aS'no matter where in the world a tourist goes , our one state of india is capable of showcasing more than all that one country can offer the tourist .'
p3953
aS'a tourist can easily tour a state for a month and if he keeps visiting our country every year , choosing to experience a new state , a lifetime wouldnt be enough to see entire india .'
p3954
aS'every state of our country has a different highlight , such varied is the heritage of our country !'
p3955
aS'north east and especially manipur have a lot of opportunities for the development of tourism .'
p3956
aS'like the chief minister just pointed out , i belong to gujarat .'
p3957
aS'krishna is celebrated in dwarka there and i have been brought up in a similar environment , worshipping lord krishna .'
p3958
aS'when i saw you worshipping lord krishna , singing his praises , i felt right at home in manipur .'
p3959
aS'the world tourism sector has an estimated potential worth 3 trillion dollars .'
p3960
aS'if there is any one sector that is growing by leaps and bounds globally , it is the tourism sector .'
p3961
aS'some places have shown a growth of 40 per cent in this sector .'
p3962
aS'india has a lot to offer to the world that can influence and inspire them .'
p3963
aS'but this area is still largely untapped .'
p3964
aS'it is our constant effort to attract the world through our rich heritage .'
p3965
aS'the game of polo was born here .'
p3966
aS'there was a polo programme arranged here yesterday , in which , according to the information i have , 8 countries participated .'
p3967
aS'this is your heritage .'
p3968
aS'i want the world to know about the place that gave birth to polo and hence i will match steps with the state in its efforts to highlight their assets .'
p3969
aS'i just met with delegates from the hrd ministry and asked them if there was a possibility of about 100 students from all the universities of the country visit north east as tourists .'
p3970
aS'only if university students start visiting , the tourism scene of the region will change drastically .'
p3971
aS'they have already begun work towards making this a possibility and you should be able to see the results soon .'
p3972
aS'and there is such diversity of heritage in manipur .'
p3973
aS'there is song , dance , theatre , costumes and what not .'
p3974
aS'it is truly reflective in its rich cultural heritage .'
p3975
aS'the reason of my joining in the sangai festival is the same .'
p3976
aS'i want the world to see what manipur has to offer and when they see the pm visiting , they might want to find out what the hoopla is all about .'
p3977
aS'there are two theories - one that says if the infrastructure is developed , tourism will develop and the other goes if tourism prospers , infrastructure will have to develop .'
p3978
aS'both theories carry equal weight .'
p3979
aS'if tourism prospers , the quality of infrastructure will improve which in turn will bring in more visitors .'
p3980
aS'these changes take place gradually over a period of time .'
p3981
aS'we just need to create a friendly environment .'
p3982
aS'if there is good connectivity then there will be a droves of visitors here .'
p3983
aS'i firmly believe that tourism is one such sector that gives maximum returns in the minimum investment .'
p3984
aS'everyone - from a snack vendor , an auto rickshaw driver , a florist , a vegetable vendor to a cab driver , a guest house owner and even those offering the option of home stay and a tea vendor - everyone can benefit from the development of tourism .'
p3985
aS'i will be particularly happy if the tea vendor earns well .'
p3986
aS'what i mean to say is that even the poorest of poor would benefit from it .'
p3987
aS'the government of india has recognised the power of manipur and hence we have decided to establish a sports university here .'
p3988
aS'manipur has a huge role to play in indias achievements in sports .'
p3989
aS'we want to harness this power to the optimum as this power is inherent in the dna of the people of manipur .'
p3990
aS'additionally , the people of manipur have a sportsman spirit and we want to set an example for the rest of the country .'
p3991
aS'some people think that a sports university only helps in creating good players but that is not the case .'
p3992
aS'a sport in itself is a large economy .'
p3993
aS'right from making a playground to those who write scoreboards , the one involved in collection of data , those looking after the players food habits , physiotherapy and sportsman costumes - everyone finds employment .'
p3994
aS'the youth of manipur who might not have been able to become players but they can train themselves in this university to become an umpire , a scorer or become a physiotherapist of a good sportsman or can become dietician of a good sportsman , they can also become makers or architects of a playground .'
p3995
aS'in a manner , opportunities of overall development are associated with a sports university .'
p3996
aS'many people might otherwise think that a sports university would mean a place where players would be trained .'
p3997
aS'but that is not the case .'
p3998
aS'it is a science , an economy , a complete creation with elements of technology , arithmetic and many such elements .'
p3999
aS'you can not imagine the amount of changes a university can bring about in manipur .'
p4000
aS'when i visited australia recently , i have asked them to collaborate with us on the manipur sports university .'
p4001
aS'i want to connect the countries of the world with manipur and you will reap the benefits in the coming days .'
p4002
aS'the youth of manipur wants job and there is a need for skill development that will eventually lead to jobs .'
p4003
aS'i have also asked an it professional that i just met , to focus on the possibility of establishing call centers here in cities like manipur , nagaland , meghalaya , mizoram etc .'
p4004
aS'instead of in cities like hyderabad and bangalore .'
p4005
aS'the weather here would diminish the need of air conditioners , thus bringing down the cost hugely .'
p4006
aS'the youth here also speak fluent english , so the language shouldnt be a barrier .'
p4007
aS'i am trying to get this done .'
p4008
aS'i will try and pull some companies here due to which there will be a lot of opportunities for the youth here and they wouldnt have to leave manipur in search of better jobs .'
p4009
aS'i have also thought of the possibility of employing the youth of manipur in the police force of delhi .'
p4010
aS'when the world sees the youth from the north east policing the streets of delhi , keeping it safe , they will realise the true potential of these states .'
p4011
aS'i want to work towards this as well .'
p4012
aS'when i was the chief minister of gujarat , i had a plan that wasnt put into action .'
p4013
aS'i had envisioned a strategy of sort where every state of the north east - 8 of them - will select and send 200 women each to be a part of the police force in gujarat , in every two years .'
p4014
aS'so , a total of 1600 women would have joined the police forces in gujarat .'
p4015
aS'imagine the kind of national integration that would be !'
p4016
aS'at the same time i had also emphasised how gujaratis were the best tourists in the whole world .'
p4017
aS'no matter where you go , you will find a gujarati there .'
p4018
aS'we like to roam around , spending the wealth we have .'
p4019
aS'so as per my plan , if 1600 girls would stay in gujarat for 2 years , they would at least mingle with 15-20 families each who would in return visit their state thus enhancing tourism .'
p4020
aS'i have told the chief minister of gujarat to explore the possibility and if anyone from the north east wants to visit gujarat , we would welcome them with open arms .'
p4021
aS'imagine the benefits these states will reap by associating with a prosperous state like gujarat .'
p4022
aS'therefore , my brothers and sisters of manipur , all the points that have been raised by the chief minister at the closing ceremony of the sangai festival today , naturally having faith in me , please be assured that i will do my best to keep that faith as i am a man who tries to live up to them .'
p4023
aS'i will go back and discuss the issues with the people of the concerned departments and see what can be done about them .'
p4024
aS'i will also try to fulfill all the promises i have made here today and put all the plans into action .'
p4025
aS'i will also expect that the manner in which manipur has made us proud in the field of sports , similarly it becomes the flag bearer in the arena of development .'
p4026
aS'however , i am deeply concerned by one issue here which i would like to address .'
p4027
aS'the youth of manipur are victims of drug abuse and this deeply hurts me .'
p4028
aS'my heart goes out to the parents of such youth .'
p4029
aS'it is our responsibility to ensure that our future generation does not suffer due to this .'
p4030
aS'it is a dangerous path and it is not about an individual but the whole family and eventually the society and the country suffers immensely due to this .'
p4031
aS'hence we need to make a collective decision as a society , to ensure that we will end this .'
p4032
aS'in a land where lord krishna and his miracles are celebrated , where we find the countrys best players , we will not let manipur suffer from such a disease .'
p4033
aS'the youth of manipur have the capability of changing the future of the country .'
p4034
aS'drugs destroy everything and today as we have gathered here at the pious occasion of the sangai festival , i request the youth of manipur to give up drugs .'
p4035
aS'i know it is a difficult addiction to kick , but once you decide , you will be able to come out of it .'
p4036
aS'once you save yourself , you and your family will benefit from it and grow .'
p4037
aS'with this request , i thank the people of manipur for inviting me here and being a part of your celebrations .'
p4038
aS'thank you !'
p4039
aa(lp4040
S'good morning .'
p4041
aS'ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour for me to be here amongst the friendly nagas to celebrate the world famous hornbill festival .'
p4042
aS'i greet you on this joyous festive season .'
p4043
aS'i congratulate the nagas for organizing this wonderful festival , which aims to preserve , promote and protect the unique cultural diversity and rich traditions of nagaland .'
p4044
aS'i also congratulate the people on the occasion of 51st anniversary of nagalands statehood .'
p4045
aS'on this auspicious day , i urge the nagas that after 50 years of statehood , look back !'
p4046
aS'introspect !'
p4047
aS'and take stock of the ground you have covered so far and what remains to be achieved .'
p4048
aS'i have seen the strength of your society today .'
p4049
aS'a very rich cultural heritage .'
p4050
aS'this must be promoted .'
p4051
aS'your culture must not only be interpreted as your colourful dances and songs , but the naga culture of sturdiness , honesty , simplicity , reflected in all your deliberations and actions .'
p4052
aS'the naga way of life means pride in your inherent strong character and your hard working attitude .'
p4053
aS'i also know that you have a rich biodiversity .'
p4054
aS'your region is located in one of the 25 hot bio-diversity areas of the world .'
p4055
aS'this must be protected at all costs , even as your embark on sustainable development of your resources .'
p4056
aS'people will come to your state for investment or tourism and they will do so because of your amazing bio-diversity and salubrious climate .'
p4057
aS'nagaland is blessed in having a young population well-versed in the english language and in tune with what is happening around the world .'
p4058
aS'this is an advantage which must be tapped .'
p4059
aS'you must capture the it outsourcing business of the world in this part of the country .'
p4060
aS'i also greatly admire the equal position of naga women in the naga society .'
p4061
aS'i recall how smartly our young naga women jawaans worked while deployed during the delhi commonwealth games .'
p4062
aS'this participation brought great pride to our nation and was a shining example for our womenfolk across the country .'
p4063
aS'the contribution of half of our population to the growth of our society is immeasurable .'
p4064
aS'nagas are sports-loving people and have the potential to perform well in disciplines such as boxing , tae kwon do , football and archery .'
p4065
aS'i feel that these activities must be promoted in a systematic way to realize the potential of the people of the region , given the right direction .'
p4066
aS'i know that it has been over a decade since prime minister vajpayee visited nagaland .'
p4067
aS'i think , nowadays , if i want to come to nagaland from delhi , or if anyone from here wants to go to delhi , it hardly takes 10-15 hours .'
p4068
aS'but prime ministers took more than 10 years to reach here .'
p4069
aS'i assure the people of nagaland that you will not have to wait this long for the prime minister to visit again .'
p4070
aS'i assure you .'
p4071
aS'i will be happy to come often to meet the people of nagaland .'
p4072
aS'i will come back to see to it that everything that i have mentioned becomes a reality .'
p4073
aS'come , let us together build a new , resurgent , stronger and more prosperous india , as well as our nagaland .'
p4074
aS'friends , for the last 2-3 days , i have been in this part of our country .'
p4075
aS'i think it is the first time that an indian prime minister has stayed in the north-east for 3 days .'
p4076
aS'in india , the word sez is very popular .'
p4077
aS'special economic zone .'
p4078
aS'but after being here for the last three days , i must say that it is not only sez , it is nez .'
p4079
aS'when i say nez , i mean natural economic zone .'
p4080
aS'the other parts of india will have to find man-made special economic zones .'
p4081
aS'but here , natural economic zones ( already exist ) .'
p4082
aS'but unfortunately , they are untapped .'
p4083
aS'it is my priority to nourish this nez for ne , north-east .'
p4084
aS'ne is meant for nezs .'
p4085
aS'nezs are meant for ne .'
p4086
aS'i took charge as the prime minister six months back .'
p4087
aS'and i would like to mention some of the initiatives we have taken for the north-east in the last 6 months .'
p4088
aS'i am sure that this is the right time to mention these initiatives as we are celebrating the hornbill festival and preparing for christmas .'
p4089
aS'the scheme called ishaan uday is a special scholarship for students from the north-east , under which 10,000 students will benefit .'
p4090

p4104
aS'all we need is road , rail , and air connectivity to develop tourism here .'
p4105
aS'energy is lifeline .'
p4106
aS'we can not do anything without energy or power .'
p4107
aS'the north-eastern region power system improvement project has been sanctioned at a cost of rs 5,000 crore for six north-eastern states including nagaland .'
p4108
aS'this will strengthen intra-state transmission and distribution systems .'
p4109
aS'our goal is 24x7x365 power supply .'
p4110
aS'nowadays , the meaning of infrastructure has totally changed .'
p4111
aS'even if you have road-rail-air connectivity , it is not enough .'
p4112
aS'you require digital connectivity too .'

aS'there is a tremendous untapped scope for india in this field of tourism , and we are focussing on it .'
p4121
aS'there are people , even in india , who do not know what a rich bio-diversity we have in this part of india .'

p4128
aS'thank you very much .'
p4129
aa(lp4130
S'i have been travelling in the north east for the past three days .'
p4131
aS'perhaps no other prime minister had the privilege of spending so much time with the people of north east , but i have been fortunate enough to get this opportunity .'
p4132
aS'this is my last programme here .'
p4133
aS'the love , welcome and respect that has been accorded to me by the residents of north east has overwhelmed me and i express my heartfelt gratitude and i am thankful to you all from the core of my heart .'
p4134
aS'my first programme in the north east was concerned with speed and this last one is concerned with energy .'
p4135
aS'for progress energy is required and so is speed , but most importantly direction is needed .'
p4136
aS'and for the nations development we have chosen the north east direction .'
p4137
aS'there have been talks of look east policy .'
p4138
aS'now is the time to move from look east to act east policy .'
p4139
aS'and within the ambit of this act east policy we want to move forward at great speed for the development of this region .'
p4140
aS'today in tripura the central government in collaboration with the state government is launching the biggest project in terms of capital investment worth rs 10,000 crore for a 726 mega watt power project .'
p4141
aS'such a small state but such a huge investment for such a large project !'
p4142
aS'this is an opportunity for tripura to make a mark on the world map .'
p4143
aS'the entire world is working in the direction of climate change ; talks are on to implement kyoto protocol .'
p4144
aS'this project in tripura will follow all the norms of kyoto protocol thereby lending tripura a chance to make a mark in the green energy movement .'
p4145
aS'recently the saarc summit took place .'
p4146
aS'the prime minister of bangladesh begum hasina ji was also present .'
p4147
aS'an important decision was taken in the saarc summit .'
p4148
aS'it was decided that the nations will strive together for energy production and use energy for mutual benefit as a common commodity .'
p4149
aS'now that the saarc nations have agreed , i will request bangladesh and i offer to provide electricity to bangladesh if it intends to purchase it .'
p4150
aS'we are in that position .'
p4151
aS'and i am making this declaration from a place which has shared bangladeshs joys and grief during the period of its freedom movement and creation .'
p4152
aS'the minister of bangladesh was telling me i am visiting after 41 years and in 1971 when freedom movement was being fought i came here to seek refuge and today i have come again and he was feeling very satisfied .'
p4153
aS'some time back the chief minister was discussing new schemes regarding petroleum sector and fertilizers plant .'
p4154
aS'we also want to develop the economy using gas based energy resources .'
p4155
aS'the ongc has doubled its budget related to gas production .'
p4156
aS'they will be able to utilize this expanded budget in regions like tripura which have abundant supply of gas and in turn rev up the nations economy .'
p4157
aS'these energy projects will enhance the job possibilities for the youth of north east and that is what our major focus is .'
p4158
aS'a few days back i had been to japan .'
p4159
aS'we have signed an agreement with the government of japan .'
p4160
aS'the north east is also going to be benefitted by this agreement .'
p4161
aS'the youth of north east is going to be benefitted by this agreement .'
p4162
aS'india and japan have taken a joint decision to try and create an economical corridor from north east to myanmar .'
p4163
aS'for this to happen so that the region grows fast we are emphasizing on this aspect so that japan also lend its support to us .'
p4164
aS'in my opinion the north east will no longer remain a neglected and secluded corner of india .'
p4165
aS'the future of north east is bright .'
p4166
aS'21st century is called the century of asia .'
p4167
aS'if this is so , that it is the century of asia then north east is the door to all asia and in a way it is a door to prosperity and i am seeing these possibilities .'
p4168
aS'a comprehensive plan to strengthen the infrastructure with rail connectivity , road connectivity , removal of digital divide , benefit of marine routes needs to be put in place .'
p4169
aS'as the chief minister was mentioning just now that all these facets should be incorporated in a one point programme .'
p4170
aS'this one point programme is to bring in the newest infrastructure in the north east and open its horizons for progress and development .'
p4171
aS'today i also wish to express my gratitude to the prime minister of bangladesh begum hasina ji for her support .'
p4172
aS'they have helped us considerably in bringing machinery and equipment to this place which otherwise would have been very difficult .'
p4173
aS'bangladesh has set an example of how two nations can come together for a project .'
p4174
aS'this will also set a precedent for saarc nations to see that how two neighbouring countries can come together for common welfare and produce such vital commodities like power from even a small place like tripura .'
p4175
aS'this event sends out this positive message to the saarc nations .'
p4176
aS'not only this , if there is coordination among states , there is cooperation among states then such a major benefit can be achieved .'
p4177
aS'in this project all the states of north east have taken collective responsibility for transmission .'
p4178
aS'that the states take up collective responsibility itself lends a new hope for future development .'
p4179
aS'i express my heartfelt gratitude to all the chief ministers of all the states for coming up and creating such an environment of cooperation .'
p4180
aS'this is our mantra too ; cooperation from all and development for all .'
p4181
aS'if we move ahead with this motto then we can scale many new heights .'
p4182
aS'in the entire north east there are a few sectors that i feel needs to be especially emphasized upon .'
p4183
aS'in our country we respect our tricolor .'
p4184
aS'we all honour and respect our tricolour .'
p4185
aS'but i take inspiration from the tricolor for a four pronged revolution .'
p4186
aS'i am talking of a multifaceted revolution .'
p4187
aS'one is green revolution .'
p4188
aS'one of the colours of the tricolor is green .'
p4189
aS'green gives us a message for green revolution .'
p4190
aS'but in this second green revolution the people of the north east can make a difference by focusing on organic farming and the agricultural product which has a worldwide market to capture .'
p4191
aS'a huge potential exists here for the same and we want to strengthen that .'
p4192
aS'second is the white colour .'
p4193
aS'there is ample scope for milk revolution in the north east .'
p4194
aS'there is unlimited potential for animal husbandry .'
p4195
aS'we should focus on the second colour and think how to bring about this second milk revolution .'
p4196
aS'third is the saffron colour .'
p4197
aS'i am talking about a saffron revolution .'
p4198
aS'we need a green revolution , a white revolution and a saffron revolution .'
p4199
aS'when i talk of a saffron revolution some people may get alarmed .'
p4200
aS'they will start thinking what is it that modi is planning ?'
p4201
aS'saffron is the colour of energy so when i talk of saffron revolution i am taking about an energy revolution .'
p4202
aS'we should be benefitted by solar radiation .'
p4203
aS'how do we strengthen solar energy potential ?'
p4204
aS'how do we incorporate energy into gas based economy and provide an overall solution ?'
p4205
aS'we need to move forward bearing these factors in mind .'
p4206
aS'and fourth is the blue colour of our ashok chakra .'
p4207
aS'this blue colour symbolizes the strength of water , it represents the marine force .'
p4208
aS'how do we strengthen our marine force ?'
p4209
aS'the entire north east has immense water sources .'
p4210
aS'it is the basin of brahmputra .'
p4211
aS'there are numerous waterfalls .'
p4212
aS'so how do we channelize this blue revolution so that it changes our economy ?'
p4213
aS'how do we develop it to its fullest potential taking it to be a vital source of energy ?'
p4214
aS'this should be our focus .'
p4215
aS'with this four pronged revolution we intend to change the destiny of not only tripura but the entire north east .'
p4216
aS'we have to strengthen our efforts so that the youth here gets employment .'
p4217
aS'in india , the place with the largest wealth of natural resources and the greatest potential for tourism is the north east .'
p4218
aS'no other state in india can match it .'
p4219
aS'this region abounds in biodiversity .'
p4220
aS'we have to attract the entire india here .'
p4221
aS'and for this , connectivity needs to be emphasized .'
p4222
aS'we have to enhance the connectivity by strengthening the rail connectivity , the road and the water connectivity .'
p4223
aS'and so we have to move in a new direction where tripura and the entire north east are able to scale new heights of development .'
p4224
aS'today this 726 mw power project comes to completion .'
p4225
aS'when the first stage got completed honorable president came here .'
p4226
aS'today on final completion i have been given the privilege of coming here .'
p4227
aS'i salute tripuras contribution in increasing the energy production .'
p4228
aS'my heart is filled with pride and satisfaction as i dedicate this project to the nation .'
p4229
aS'i once again thank bangladesh for its contribution .'
p4230
aS'we offer to sell power to bangladesh to meet its power requirements .'
p4231
aS'india can work towards bringing light to bangladesh also .'
p4232
aS'thank you .'
p4233
aa(lp4234
S'president vladimir putin and members of the media , it is truly a great pleasure to welcome president putin to india .'
p4235
aS'we have met twice at the opposite ends of the world - in brazil and australia .'
p4236
aS'i am honoured to host him in delhi for the annual summit .'
p4237
aS'since the turn of the century , he has been a key architect of our partnership .'
p4238
aS'president putin and prime minister vajpayee launched the annual summit process in 2000 .'
p4239
aS'when prime minister vajpayee held the first of summits in moscow in november 2001 , i was there to sign the sister-state agreement between gujarat and astrakhan .'
p4240
aS'president putin is a leader of a great nation with which we have a friendship of unmatched mutual confidence , trust and goodwill .'
p4241
aS'we have a strategic partnership that is incomparable in content .'
p4242
aS'the steadfast support of the people of russia for india has been there even at difficult moments in our history .'
p4243
aS'it has been a pillar of strength for indias development , security and international relations .'
p4244
aS'india , too , has always stood with russia through its own challenges .'
p4245
aS'the character of global politics and international relations is changing .'
p4246
aS'however , the importance of this relationship and its unique place in indias foreign policy will not change .'
p4247
aS'in many ways , its significance to both countries will grow further in the future .'
p4248
aS'russia has been indias foremost defence partner through decades .'
p4249
aS'my first visit outside delhi as prime minister was to our new aircraft carrier , ins vikramaditya .'
p4250
aS'it sails our seas as a great symbol of our defence cooperation .'
p4251
aS'even as indias options have increased today , russia will remain our most important defence partner .'
p4252
aS'we have conducted joint exercises across all three wings of the armed forces in the last six months .'
p4253
aS'president putin and i discussed a broad range of new defence projects .'
p4254
aS'we also discussed how to align our defence relations to indias own priorities , including make in india .'
p4255
aS'i am pleased that russia has offered to fully manufacture in india one of its most advanced helicopters .'
p4256
aS'it includes the possibility of exports from india .'
p4257
aS'it can be used for both military and civilian use .'
p4258
aS'we will follow up on this quickly .'
p4259
aS'i also proposed that russia should locate manufacturing facilities in india for spares and components for russian defence equipment in india .'
p4260
aS'he responded very positively to my request .'
p4261
aS'energy security is critical for indias economic development and creating jobs for our youth .'
p4262
aS'russia is also a key partner in this area .'
p4263
aS'i am pleased that the first unit of the kudankulam nuclear power plant is on stream .'
p4264
aS'it has added 20 % to the existing capacity for nuclear power in india .'
p4265
aS'we are on course for installing the next three units of 1000 mw each .'
p4266
aS'today , we have outlined an ambitious vision for nuclear energy of at least ten more reactors .'
p4267
aS'it will have the highest standards of safety in the world .'
p4268
aS'it will also include manufacture of equipment and components in india .'
p4269
aS'this also supports our make in india policy .'
p4270
aS'russia is the worlds top source for hydrocarbon resources ; and , india one of the worlds largest importers .'
p4271
aS'yet , despite our close friendship , our collaboration in this sector has been disappointing .'
p4272
aS'today , we have made a new start with a few important agreements .'
p4273
aS'but , we will set an ambitious agenda for partnership in oil and natural gas .'
p4274
aS'today we have taken a number of decisions and signed several agreements .'
p4275
aS'they also reflect our shared belief that in todays world , vibrant economic relations constitute a key pillar of a strong strategic partnership .'
p4276
aS'similarly , closer contacts between people and in areas like education , culture and tourism are important .'
p4277
aS'i thank president putin for his support for indias closer relations with eurasian economic union .'
p4278
aS'the international north south transport corridor will connect us better .'
p4279
aS'and , today , we will jointly visit the world diamond conference .'
p4280
aS'this highlights our new innovative approaches to strengthening economic relations .'
p4281
aS'president putin and i agreed that this is a challenging moment in the world .'
p4282
aS'our partnership and the strong sensitivity that we have always had for each others interests will be a source of strength to both countries .'
p4283
aS'i conveyed my deepest condolences for the loss of lives in the terrorist attack in chechnya .'
p4284
aS'this also reflects our many shared challenges .'
p4285
aS'our areas of priority for our cooperation include combating terrorism and extremism ; advancing peace and stability in afghanistan ; working together for a stable , balanced , peaceful and prosperous asia pacific ; and , cooperating for development in other countries .'
p4286
aS'institutions like brics , east asia summit and g 20 have also widened our framework of engagement .'
p4287
aS'this is president putins eleventh annual summit and my first .'
p4288
aS'this summit reinforced my conviction in the extraordinary value and strength of this partnership .'
p4289
aS'i am confident that our bilateral cooperation and international partnership will acquire new vigour and scale new heights in the years ahead .'
p4290
aS'thank you .'
p4291
aa(lp4292
S'ladies and gentlemen , i am delighted that delhi is hosting the world diamond conference .'
p4293
aS'we are especially pleased that president putin is here with us today .'
p4294
aS'he is a leader of indias key strategic partner and , personally , a great friend of india .'
p4295
aS'in addition , russia is the source of more than a quarter of the worlds production of diamonds .'
p4296
aS'i understand that this is the first conference of its kind in the world .'
p4297
aS'this is a source of great pride for us .'
p4298
aS'i want to congratulate and thank gem and jewellery export promotion council , the ministry of commerce and industry , and , the world diamond mark for organising this event .'
p4299
aS'india is the natural venue for this conference .'
p4300
aS'for one , it is generally believed that diamond is indias gift to the world .'
p4301
aS'more than two thousand years ago , diamond was deeply valued in india .'
p4302
aS'it was even traded with china over the silk route .'
p4303
aS'it was even traded with china over the silk route .'
p4304
aS'till about the 18th century , india was considered to be the only source of diamond .'
p4305
aS'till of course , the world began mining for diamond in africa .'
p4306
aS'i am delighted that south africas minister for mineral resources is with us today .'
p4307
aS'thank you , i welcome you here .'
p4308
aS'today , india is the worlds largest centre for cutting and polishing diamond and its largest importer of uncut diamond .'
p4309
aS'diamond has become a universal symbol of wealth and enduring love .'
p4310
aS'but , in india it is also a great source of jobs for our people .'
p4311
aS'the gems and jewellery sector in india employs nearly 3.'
p4312
aS'5 million people ; 1 million of them work in the diamond industry .'
p4313
aS'gems and jewellery 35 , india today exports cut and polished diamond worth 20 billion us dollars .'
p4314
aS'surat has emerged as the biggest centre in the world for cutting and polishing diamonds .'
p4315
aS'- - 30 - it hosts enterprises with some of the most advanced technologies and machinery in the world .'
p4316
aS'although the bharat diamond bourse was established in 2010 , it has become the worlds largest exchange in the world .'
p4317
aS'few in india would be aware that out of ten polished diamond pieces sold globally , nine have been processed in india .'
p4318
aS'- , the diamonds sparkle in the world because of the skills of indian workers .'
p4319
aS'so , we welcome the efforts of this conference and the world mark foundation to increase the global market for diamonds .'
p4320
aS'however , rough diamond in india comes from abroad .'
p4321
aS'and , it mostly comes indirectly through places like antwerp and dubai .'
p4322
aS'of course , antwerp trade is now run mainly by indians .'
p4323
aS'while most of rough diamonds from russia come to india , less than 20 % comes directly to india .'
p4324
aS'we have with us today the head of russian company alrosa , which controls most of the production and trade in rough diamonds in russia .'
p4325
aS'it has direct sales contract with 7 to 8 indian companies .'
p4326
aS'i know that there are representatives of many bourses here .'
p4327
aS'but , i will be honest and say that i want major diamond mining companies to sell directly to the indian diamond industry .'
p4328
aS'it will be good for them and for india .'
p4329
aS'i have made three proposals to president putin .'
p4330
aS'first , i would like alrosa to have direct long term contracts with more indian companies .'
p4331
aS'i am pleased to know that they are moving in that direction .'
p4332
aS'second , i want alrosa and others to trade directly on our bourse .'
p4333
aS'we have decided to create a special notified zone , in which major mining companies can import rough diamonds on a consignment basis and re-export unsold ones .'
p4334
aS'this is going to benefit indian diamond industry and create more jobs for our youth .'
p4335
aS'third , i asked president putin to reform regulations so that russian jewellery makers can send their rough diamond to india and re-import polished diamond without paying duty .'
p4336
aS'this will give a boost to our diamond industry .'
p4337
aS'these measures will also boost india-russia economic ties .'
p4338
aS'india and russia have outstanding cooperation in a broad range of areas .'
p4339
aS'we want to focus on transforming our economic relations .'
p4340
aS'we want to make this a key pillar of our relationship .'
p4341
aS'our joint partnership - here is an indication of our new approach to expand our economic partnership .'
p4342
aS'president putins enthusiasm for russian participation in our make in india programme will help expand manufacturing and create jobs for our people .'
p4343
aS'there are many other sectors in india , like the diamond industry , which have huge potential for creating employment and generating exports .'
p4344
aS'their modernisation and development is a great priority for my government .'
p4345
aS'i am deeply encouraged by the level of international participation .'
p4346
aS'in every sector of business , you will find that india not only offers productive business opportunities , but it is also easy to work in .'
p4347
aS'you will find an environment that is welcoming and responsive .'
p4348
aS'thank you all for coming .'
p4349
aa(lp4350
S'my dear fellow countrymen , today i have this great opportunity of interacting with you again .'
p4351
aS'you must be wondering why a prime minister should be interacting the way i am doing it .'
p4352
aS'well , first and foremost , i am a less of your prime minister and more of a pradhan sewak ( serving the people ) .'
p4353
aS'since childhood i have been hearing that by sharing , our intensity of pain become less while the intensity of our joys grow manifold .'
p4354
aS'well i think , this is the guiding thought behind mann ki baat .'
p4355
aS'it is an opportunity for me to sometimes share my concern and sometimes my joy .'
p4356
aS'sharing my deepest concerns with you makes me feel light hearted and sharing my joy just doubles my happiness .'
p4357
aS'last time , i mentioned my concern about the youth of the country .'
p4358
aS'it is not because you chose me as the prime minister but because i feel concerned as an individual .'
p4359
aS'sons and daughters of many families are caught in the trap of drugs .'
p4360
aS'it just does not destroy the person involved , but his entire family , the society and the nation at large .'
p4361
aS'drug is such a grave menace which destroys the most powerful individuals .'
p4362
aS'while serving as the chief minister of gujarat , my officers with good records would often come to ask for leave .'
p4363
aS'initially they would hesitate to spell out the reasons , however on insisting they revealed that their child had fallen into the drug trap and they now need to spend time with their kids and rehabilitate them .'
p4364
aS'i could see the bravest of my officers struggling to control their tears .'
p4365
aS'i met suffering mothers too .'
p4366
aS'in punjab i had the chance to meet some mothers who were very angry and yet concerned about their children who had fallen into the trap of drugs .'
p4367
aS'we have to work together as a society to tackle this menace .'
p4368
aS'i understand that the youth who fall into this drug trap are often blamed .'
p4369
aS'we blame these youth as being careless and irresponsible .'
p4370
aS'we perceive that the victims are bad but the fact is that the drugs are bad .'
p4371
aS'the youth are not wrong ; it is this addiction which is wrong .'
p4372
aS'let us not blame and wrong our kids .'
p4373
aS'let us get rid of this habit of addiction and not victimize our kids .'
p4374
aS'blaming the kids would push them further into addiction .'
p4375
aS'this is in fact a psycho-socio-medical issue and let us treat it as such a problem .'
p4376
aS'this menace needs to be handled carefully as its solution is not limited to medical intervention only .'
p4377
aS'the individual concerned , his family , friends , the society , the government and the legal system all have to work in tandem to tackle this menace .'
p4378
aS'each one of us have to contribute to get rid of this menace.'
p4379
ag1044
aS'a few days ago , i had organized a dgp level conference in assam .'
p4380
aS'i expressed my concern over this issue and my displeasure at the non-serious attitude of the people concerned .'
p4381
aS'i have asked the police department to seriously discuss this issue and come out with relevant solutions .'
p4382
aS'i have suggested the department to launch a toll free helpline .'
p4383
aS'the families often feel ashamed to come out in open about the addiction problem of their children .'
p4384
aS'they have no one to confide in .'
p4385
aS'parents from any part , any corner of the country can freely approach the police if their children have fallen a victim to addiction .'
p4386
aS'the department has taken this suggestion seriously and working towards its fulfillment .'
p4387
aS'the drug menace brings about the three ds .'
p4388
aS'these three ds are not the ones related to entertainment but i am talking about the three ds related to the three vices .'
p4389
aS'first d is darkness , the second d is destruction and the third d is devastation .'
p4390
aS'drugs lead a person to a blind path of destruction .'
p4391
aS'there is nothing left in its trail but devastation .'
p4392
aS'this is a topic of great concern and demands total attention .'
p4393
aS'i had mentioned this topic in my last address in mann ki baat .'
p4394
aS'we received more than 7000 letters on our akashvani address .'
p4395
aS'some letters were received in the government offices .'
p4396
aS'we received responses on government portal , mygov .'
p4397
aS'in , online and through e-mails .'
p4398
aS'lakhs of comments were received on twitter and facebook .'
p4399
aS'hence , a deep rooted concern in the societys psyche has found a voice .'
p4400
aS'i am especially thankful to the media of our country for carrying this concern forward .'
p4401
aS'many channels conducted hour long programs .'
p4402
aS'these programs were not just meant to criticize the government .'
p4403
aS'they were forums for open discussion , a concern and an effort to come out with workable solutions .'
p4404
aS'these initiatives created background for healthy discussions .'
p4405
aS'the government was also sensitized to its responsibilities in this direction .'
p4406
aS'the government can no longer remain neutral to these concerns .'
p4407
aS'there is a question i want to ask these youth caught in the drug trap .'
p4408
aS'i want to ask these youth that when for three or four hours they are in a state of intoxication , they might be feeling free of all concerns , free of all tensions and in a different world altogether .'
p4409
aS'but have you ever lent a thought to the fact that when you buy drugs where does this money go to ?'
p4410
aS'have you ever thought about it ?'
p4411
aS'just make a guess .'
p4412
aS'what if this drug money goes to the terrorists ?'
p4413
aS'what if this money is spent by the terrorists to procure weapons ?'
p4414
aS'and with this weapon the very same terrorist might be pumping bullets in the heart of my soldiers .'
p4415
aS'the soldier of my country gets martyred .'
p4416
aS'have you ever thought about our soldiers- a soldier who is so dear to his mother , the treasured son of mother india , the brave son of the soil is hit by a bullet probably funded by the money spent on purchasing drugs .'
p4417
aS'i know and firmly believe that you too love your motherland and have tremendous respect for our soldiers .'
p4418
aS'then how can you support a habit which funds drug mafia and the terrorists .'
p4419
aS'some people feel that when a person is in despair , faces failures and when he is directionless , he is an easy prey to drugs .'
p4420
aS'but i feel that people who lack ambition , do not have any set goals and targets , who have a deep vacuum in their lives , are the ones where drugs will have an easy access .'
p4421
aS'if you want to avoid drugs and save your children from this menace then foster ambition in them , give them dreams to pursue and make them individuals with a desire to achieve something in life .'
p4422
aS'then you will see that they will not be easily distracted .'
p4423
aS'their aim then will be to achieve something in life .'
p4424
aS'have you ever followed a sportsmans life ?'
p4425
aS'a sportsman is motivated forever .'
p4426
aS'in the bleak winters everyone feels like sleeping in the warmth of a quilt but a sportsman will still rise at 4 or 5 and go for his workouts .'
p4427
aS'why ?'
p4428
aS'because the goal is set .'
p4429
aS'similarly , if your child would be aimless , there are chances of him/her to fall prey to menace like drugs .'
p4430
aS'i remember the words of vivekananda .'
p4431
aS'these words are very apt for all the young people .'
p4432
aS'just keep repeating this thought over and over again .'
p4433
aS'take a thought , make it your life .'
p4434
aS'ponder on it and dream about it .'
p4435
aS'make it an integral part of your dreams .'
p4436
aS'make it a part of your mind , brain , veins and each and every part of your body and forget everything else .'
p4437
aS'this thought of vivekananda is apt for every young person and that is why i say that each person should have an ambition in life .'
p4438
aS'having an ambition does not allow your focus on unnecessary things .'
p4439
aS'some take it under peer pressure because it looks cool , some consider it as a style statement .'
p4440
aS'so sometimes the youth inadvertently fall into this serious trap , due to the wrong mental perception .'
p4441
aS'addiction is neither cool nor a style statement .'
p4442
aS'in reality , it is a precursor to destruction .'
p4443
aS'so whenever your friends boast about their drug habits , do not applaud and enjoy such conversation .'
p4444
aS'do not be a mute spectator to such absurdities .'
p4445
aS'have the courage to stand against such conversations and say no .'
p4446
aS'have the guts to despise such a conversation , reject such a conversation and have the guts to tell the person that he is wrong .'
p4447
aS'i would like to share some views with the parents too .'
p4448
aS'these days none of us have time .'
p4449
aS'all of us are running against time to earn our livelihood .'
p4450
aS'we are racing against time to improve the quality of our lives .'
p4451
aS'but in this blind race , do we have the time to spare for our kids .'
p4452
aS'do we ever work for our kids spiritual progress and discuss it with them , rather we discuss only material progress .'
p4453
aS'how are they doing in their studies , what has been their progress in exam , what to eat and what not to eat , where to go and where not to go majorly these topics form the core of the entire interactions .'
p4454
aS'do we share such a relationship that our children can bare their hearts to us ?'
p4455
aS'i request all of you to do this .'
p4456
aS'if your children share a frank relationship then you can very well know what is going on in their life .'
p4457
aS'children do not take to bad habits suddenly .'
p4458
aS'it happens gradually and it also impacts the home .'
p4459
aS'observe the changes that are happening in your home .'
p4460
aS'if you observe closely then i believe that you may be successful in detecting the problem at the very beginning .'
p4461
aS'be aware of your childs friend circle and dont keep your conversations focused just about progress .'
p4462
aS'your concern should extend to their inner depths , their thoughts , their logic , their books , their friends and their mobiles - how and where are they spending their time .'
p4463
aS'these need to be taken care of .'
p4464
aS'i believe that no one else can do what a parent can for their kids .'
p4465
aS'our ancestors have left us certain pearls of wisdom and that is why they are known as statesmen .'
p4466
aS'a saying goes like this : paanch varsh laaw lijiyedass laaw tadan deipaanch varsh laaw lijiyedass laaw tadan deisut hi solah varsh meinmitra sarij gani deithis means that till 5 years of age a child should grow in the loving and tender care of his parents , by the time he is 10 the values of discipline should be inculcated in him .'
p4467
aS'sometimes we see that an intelligent mother gets angry and does not speak with her child throughout the day .'
p4468
aS'this is a big punishment for the child .'
p4469
aS'the mother punishes herself but the child too gets punished in turn .'
p4470
aS'the mother just has to say that i will not talk and the 10 year old will remain worried the whole day long .'
p4471
aS'he changes his habit and by the time he is of 16 years then the relationship should turn like a friend towards him .'
p4472
aS'there should be an open conversation with him .'
p4473
aS'this is a brilliant advice which has been passed on by our ancestors .'
p4474
aS'i would like to see this inculcated in our family life .'
p4475
aS'another thing brought to our notice is the role of the pharmacists .'
p4476
aS'some of the medicines lead to addiction .'
p4477
aS'so such medicines should not be distributed without a doctors prescription .'
p4478
aS'sometimes a simple thing like a cough syrup can trigger addiction .'
p4479
aS'it becomes the starting point for addiction .'
p4480
aS'there are quite a few things that i would not like to raise from this platform .'
p4481
aS'but we will have to follow and accept this discipline .'
p4482
aS'these days many children from villages go to city for higher education and start living in a hostel or a boarding school .'
p4483
aS'i have heard that sometimes these avenues become the entry point of such addiction .'
p4484
aS'for this the education system , the society and the security force will have to act as a vigilante .'
p4485
aS'each one will have to fulfill their roles and responsibilities .'
p4486
aS'the government will fulfill the responsibilities on its end .'
p4487
aS'we should constantly strive to fulfill our obligations .'
p4488
aS'i would also like to mention about the letters we have received .'
p4489
aS'some of them are interesting , some are filled with grief and some are inspiring .'
p4490
aS'i can not mention all , but i would like to mention one .'
p4491
aS'there was a certain mr dutt .'
p4492
aS'he was deep into addiction .'
p4493
aS'he was also jailed where he had several restrictions .'
p4494
aS'then later his life changed .'
p4495
aS'he studied in jail and then his life was transformed .'
p4496
aS'his story is very famous .'
p4497
aS'he was in yerawada jail .'
p4498
aS'there might be many such inspiring stories .'
p4499
aS'many people have been victorious in their fight against addiction .'
p4500
aS'we too can come out of such habits and so we should definitely try .'
p4501
aS'we should make efforts for de-addiction and rehabilitation .'
p4502
aS'i would ask celebrities to be a part of this initiative - be it from the field of cinema , sports or someone concerned with public life .'
p4503
aS'be it the cultural or spiritual world , we should use every possible platform to create awareness .'
p4504
aS'there should be constant messages in public interest .'
p4505
aS'they will certainly have an effect .'
p4506
aS'those active on the social media , i would request them to create a continuous online movement by joining # drugsfreeindia hash-tag .'
p4507
aS'this is more relevant because most of the addicted youth are a part of the social media .'
p4508
aS'if we take this # drugsfreeindia hash-tag movement forward then we will do a great service for public awareness and education .'
p4509
aS'i want to take this concern forward .'
p4510
aS'i would request all those who have successfully come out of this addiction to share their stories .'
p4511
aS'i touched this topic because like i said in the beginning grief becomes less on sharing .'
p4512
aS'this is a topic of national concern and i am not here to sermonize .'
p4513
aS'and neither am i entitled to preach .'
p4514
aS'i am just sharing my grief with you .'
p4515
aS'those families who are suffering from this menace , i want to share their pain as well .'
p4516
aS'i want to create a responsible environment .'
p4517
aS'there can be difference of opinions but let us make a beginning somewhere .'
p4518
aS'like i mentioned before , i want to share happiness .'
p4519
aS'last week i had the opportunity to meet the blind cricket team .'
p4520
aS'they had won the world cup .'
p4521
aS'what joy and excitement , they were exuding great self confidence .'
p4522
aS'god has given us everything , eyes , hands , legs i .'
p4523
aS'e .'
p4524
aS'we are totally capable yet we lack this kind of determination and passion which i could see in the blind cricketers .'
p4525
aS'what zeal and enthusiasm , really it was contagious .'
p4526
aS'i felt super charged after meeting them .'
p4527
aS'such incidents bring great pleasure in life .'
p4528
aS'in the past few days there was yet another important news .'
p4529
aS'the cricket team from kashmir defeated mumbai on their home ground .'
p4530
aS'i do not view it as a matter of someones victory and others loss .'
p4531
aS'i view it differently .'
p4532
aS'all the stadiums in kashmir have been inundated after the floods .'
p4533
aS'kashmir is passing through a tough phase .'
p4534
aS'the circumstances have been extremely grim with these boys not standing any chance to practice .'
p4535
aS'but the team spirit shown by these boys , their conviction and determination is awe inspiring .'
p4536
aS'these boys have shown us that one can overcome the most trying and testing circumstances if one remains focused on our goals .'
p4537
aS'this news gave me immense pleasure and i take this opportunity to congratulate all these players on their victory .'
p4538
aS'two days back , the united nations has decided to celebrate june 21st as international yoga day .'
p4539
aS'it is a matter of great pride and honour for india .'
p4540
aS'our ancestors developed a beautiful tradition and today the entire world is associated with it .'
p4541
aS'it does not merely benefit one personally but it has the potential to bring all the people together globally .'
p4542
aS'the entire world came together on the issue of yoga in the un and a unanimous resolution was passed just two days back .'
p4543
aS'177 countries became the co-sponsors .'
p4544
aS'in the past when it was decided to celebrate the birthday mr nelson mandela , 165 countries became co-sponsors .'
p4545
aS'before that efforts were on for international toilet day and 122 nations became co-sponsors to that initiative too .'
p4546
aS'for celebrating oct 2nd as non violence day 140 countries became co-sponsors , before that .'
p4547
aS'but 177 countries co- sponsoring yoga is a world record of sorts .'
p4548
aS'i am thankful to all the countries that have come out in support and have honored the sentiments of the indians and decided to observe world yoga day .'
p4549
aS'it is now our duty that yoga reaches out to the masses in its true essence .'
p4550
aS'last week i had the chance to have a meeting with the chief ministers of all the states .'
p4551
aS'this tradition has been going on for the past 50-60 years .'
p4552
aS'this time it was organized at the prime ministers residence .'
p4553
aS'we started it as a retreat program with no papers , no files and no officers .'
p4554
aS'it was a simple interaction where the prime minister and chief minister were all the same , seated together like friends .'
p4555
aS'for an hour or two , matters of national concern were seriously discussed in a friendly atmosphere .'
p4556
aS'everyone just poured their hearts out .'
p4557
aS'there was no political agenda involved .'
p4558
aS'this too was a memorable experience that i wanted to share with you .'
p4559
aS'last week i had the chance to travel to the north east .'
p4560
aS'i had been there for three days .'
p4561
aS'many a times youth express their desire to see the taj , singapore or dubai .'
p4562
aS'but i would urge all the nature lovers , all who want to experience the divinity in nature , to take a tour of the north east .'
p4563
aS'i had gone earlier too .'
p4564
aS'this time when i went as the prime minister , i tried to explore its potential .'
p4565
aS'our north east has tremendous potential and possibilities .'
p4566
aS'its a land of beautiful people and beautiful surroundings .'
p4567
aS'i was filled with immense joy visiting that place .'
p4568
aS'sometimes people ask modi ji dont you get tired ?'
p4569
aS'i want to say that whatever little fatigue i had , well the north east took it away completely , i am thoroughly rejuvenated .'
p4570
aS'such is the pleasure that i derived from that visit .'
p4571
aS'the love and respect accorded by the people there is something that will stay with me forever .'
p4572
aS'the kinship and affinity showed by the people of the north east touched me deeply .'
p4573
aS'i will also tell you , it is not a joy for only modi to enjoy , it is there for you to enjoy too .'
p4574
aS'so do travel to the north east and enjoy .'
p4575
aS'the next edition of mann ki baat will happen in 2015 .'
p4576
aS'this is probably my last program in 2014 .'
p4577
aS'i wish you all a merry christmas .'
p4578
aS'i would like to wish all the very best of new year hes in advance .'
p4579
aS'it gives me immense pleasure to know that this program mann ki baat is broadcast in regional languages by the local radio stations that same night at 8 pm .'
p4580
aS'and it is surprising to know some of the regional voice-over artists also speak in the voice very similar to me .'
p4581
aS'i am surprised at the brilliant work being done by the artists associated at akashvani and i would like to congratulate them .'
p4582
aS'i consider this as an effective medium to connect to the masses .'
p4583
aS'we have had tremendous response .'
p4584
aS'seeing the response akashvani has devised a new method .'
p4585
aS'they have taken a new post box number .'
p4586
aS'so now if you wish to write into me you can write on this post box number .'
p4587
aS'mann ki baatpost box no 111 , akashvaninew delhi .'
p4588
aS'i will be awaiting your letters .'
p4589
aS'you do not realize that your letters become my inspiration .'
p4590
aS'some suggestions penned down can do good to the entire nation .'
p4591
aS'i am thankful to you all .'
p4592
aS'we will meet next in 2015 and on some sunday morning we will again have our own mann ki baat .'
p4593
aS'thank you very much .'

p4596
aS'on behalf of the people of india and on my personal behalf , i welcome you all to this summit .'
p4597
aS'in january , 2013 , while concluding the sixth summit , i had extended an invitation for todays event .'
p4598
aS'your response has been outstanding .'
p4599
aS'i am glad to be here to welcome you .'
p4600
aS'on this occasion , i express my gratitude to the old partners of this event - both countries and organisations .'
p4601
aS'these include japan and canada .'
p4602
aS'without their support , this event could not have come this far .'
p4603
aS'i also welcome warmly and thank new partners like usa , uk , netherlands , australia , singapore and south africa for joining this event .'
p4604
aS'i particularly thank the secretary general of the united nations and the president of the world bank for their presence .'
p4605
aS'it shows their commitment towards progress and prosperity in emerging economies .'
p4606
aS'your partnership has enhanced the enterprising spirit of 60 million gujaratis it has boosted the morale of 1.'
p4607
aS'2 billion indians .'
p4608
aS'this event is perhaps the biggest gathering on earth where , a budding entrepreneur has the opportunity to see the president of the world bank .'
p4609
aS'and where a young farmer , dreaming to set up a food processing unit , can listen to the views of the un secretary general on issues like food security .'
p4610
aS'that is why , during one of the previous events , i had called it davos in action .'
p4611
aS'friends !'
p4612
aS'india has always believed that the whole world is one family ( vasudhaiva kutumbakam ) .'
p4613
aS'few have seen this in practice i am informed that more than hundred countries are participating in this event .'
p4614
aS'we are here as a family not only in terms of space , but also because we recognise that : someones dream is dependent on someones direction ; someones success is related to someones support ; someones curiosity is linked to someones care ; this is what a family does .'
p4615
aS'the ultimate objective is welfare of all loka samastah sukhinau bhavantu .'
p4616
aS'i am sure all of us , from the secretary general of un to the president of the world bank , from leaders of the strongest economies to delegations of small countries , from ceos of fortune 500 companies to start-up entrepreneurs , all want the planet earth to become a better place to live .'
p4617
aS'thus , our meeting here is not just -a meeting of hands but also of hearts ; it is not only a meeting of ideas , but also of aspirations as a host to this family gathering , as a curator of thousands of dreams floating here , i welcome you all once again i hope your stay here is comfortable .'
p4618
aS'i trust you will enjoy our hospitality .'
p4619
aS'this is the time of kite festival in gujarat .'
p4620
aS'this festival gives us the message of high spirits .'
p4621
aS'do participate in it .'
p4622
aS'friends !'
p4623
aS'after becoming prime minister , i have travelled to the remotest parts of india and also to various parts of the world .'
p4624
aS'i have been to the un , brics , asean , east asian summit , g-20 and saarc summits .'
p4625
aS'some common worries have been expressed everywhere .'
p4626
aS'the biggest concern is about the global economy .'
p4627
aS'we all have to find ways for its stability and recovery .'
p4628
aS'we also have to work for sustainable and inclusive growth .'
p4629
aS'we , in india , believe that problems present us with opportunities to become stronger , disciplined and innovative .'
p4630
aS'my government is trying to generate confidence .'
p4631
aS'we have prepared a team to secure a robust future .'
p4632
aS'we believe that changes start with a change in mindset .'
p4633
aS'friends !'
p4634
aS'it is a matter of great pride that today , there is tremendous interest in india .'
p4635
aS'countries are coming forward to work with us .'
p4636
aS'this has , of course , generated expectations from us .'
p4637
aS'indias present as well as its rich past is being recognised i thank the un secretary general for giving a formal international stature to yoga .'
p4638
aS'a record number of 177 countries supported the indian proposal .'
p4639
aS'yoga is both a science and an art for improving human life .'
p4640
aS'in todays world , it teaches us to remain stable even in adverse situations .'
p4641
aS'friends , the 2009 edition of this event created vibrancy when the state of the global economy was depressing .'
p4642
aS'the summits of 2011 and 2013 succeeded in strengthening investor confidence .'
p4643
aS'it is only because of persistence with positivity that this event of gujarat government has become an event for the entire country .'
p4644
aS'this platform has been enlarged so that other states too can take advantage .'
p4645
aS'today , many other states have adopted this approach the government of india is committed to support such initiatives by any state government .'
p4646
aS'friends !'
p4647
aS'we will have to change the way we have been approaching problems .'
p4648
aS'recession is often seen just in the context of business and industry .'
p4649
aS'have we ever thought of recession as being the result of low per capita income in countries where a majority of the global population lives ?'
p4650
aS'have we ever thought of its solution in terms of enhancing the common mans employability , income and purchasing power ?'
p4651
aS'this is the biggest task at hand in india .'
p4652
aS'mahatma gandhi rightly talked about the last man .'
p4653
aS'and gandhijis message can show us the way it is therefore appropriate that this summit is taking place in mahatma mandir .'
p4654
aS'to me , the best outcome of this event should be inclusiveness and involvement of communities needing care and development .'
p4655
aS'thus , this event stands for- inclusiveness of small with big ; inclusiveness of poor with rich ; inclusiveness of gut feelings with mature thoughtsi assure this global platform that india wants to work with the global leadership .'
p4656
aS'be they issues of poverty or ecology .'
p4657
aS'we want to contribute to welfare of the global community .'
p4658
aS'we are aware that with one sixth of the worlds population , our activities will have a global impact .'
p4659
aS'we are ready to learn and make this impact positive .'
p4660
aS'however , india has to be seen from a different angle it is not just a country of today .'
p4661
aS'it is also an old civilisation .'
p4662
aS'it is not just a country of a few cities .'
p4663
aS'it is a country of thousands of towns and several hundred thousand villages .'
p4664
aS'it is a country of diverse communities therefore , india has its own solutions for many pressing problems .'

aS'because , we know , this is what will work in india .'
p4668
aS'friends !'
p4669
aS'our last national elections marked a turning point in indian democracy .'
p4670
aS'they indicated the high aspirations of our people .'
p4671
aS'this was amply reflected in the record voter participation and a clear verdict in favour of one political party after a gap of 30 years .'
p4672
aS'my government is committed to changing and improving the economic and social condition of india including the quality of life .'
p4673
aS'in a short span of seven months , we have been able to change the atmosphere of despair and uncertainty .'

aS'since the first day , my government is actively working to revive the economy .'
p4675
aS'my government is committed to create a policy environment that is predictable , transparent and fair .'
p4676
aS'friends !'
p4677
aS'we are on the path of transformation .'
p4678
aS'to start this process , we are making efforts to change the work culture .'
p4679
aS'we have to strengthen our institutions and systems of delivery .'
p4680
aS'to drive this change forcefully , we have recently re-constituted our planning commission now , it is known as niti ayog .'
p4681
aS'we want to promote co-operative federalism in the country at the same time , we want a competitive element among the states to create and attract whatever is needed there .'
p4682
aS'i call this new form of federalism co-operative and competitive federalism .'
p4683
aS'you may be aware that our economic growth had slowed down during the last few years now , my government is putting all efforts to ensure faster and yet inclusive growth .'
p4684
aS'the initial results are encouraging .'
p4685
aS'on the economic front , during the first two quarters , we registered a growth rate which was one percent higher than the previous year .'
p4686
aS'the imf has observed that india will be the 2nd fastest growing economy in the coming years .'
p4687
aS'according to the latest forecast of the oecd , india would be the only country among worlds top economies which would increase its pace of growth this year hsbcs latest report has identified india as the worlds largest growing exporter , which is set to move from being the fourteenth to the fifth largest exporter in the world by 2030.'
p4688
aS'on the political front also , people of various states have supported us in the recent assembly elections .'
p4689
aS'this gives us the confidence that we are moving in right direction .'
p4690
aS'let me tell you a little about what we are doing and where we want to reach .'
p4691
aS'friends !'
p4692
aS'we are not merely making commitments and announcements .'
p4693
aS'we are also backing them up with concrete action at the level of policy and practice .'
p4694
aS'for example , i announced a financial inclusion programme .'
p4695
aS'in four months , we have opened more than 100 million bank accounts .'

p4701
aS'we have taken similar steps in many other areas .'
p4702
aS'these include bringing 49 % fdi in insurance .'
p4703
aS'it also includes liberalization of fdi norms for manufacturing of medical devices .'
p4704
aS'simultaneously , on the administrative front , we are actively working to provide policy driven governance .'
p4705
aS'we have taken far reaching decisions to ensure supply of key natural resources .'
p4706
aS'this includes coal , iron ore and other minerals .'
p4707
aS'we have also amended legal provisions to facilitate availability of land .'
p4708
aS'this has been done to enable development in remote areas while ensuring better returns to the farming community .'
p4709
aS'we are trying to complete the circle of economic reforms speedily .'
p4710
aS'we are also keen to see that our policies are predictable .'
p4711
aS'we are clear that our tax regime should be stable .'
p4712
aS'in the last few months , we have taken several decisions in this direction .'
p4713
aS'we have put focus on building infrastructure through public and private investments .'
p4714
aS'this will include national roads , national grids of gas , electricity and water .'
p4715
aS'it also includes rural infrastructure , 24x7 electric supply , farm irrigation and cleaning of rivers .'
p4716
aS'in order to execute the infrastructure plan , a fast track ppp mechanism is being put in place .'
p4717
aS'we are undertaking the sagarmala project to ensure port led development .'
p4718
aS'existing ports are being modernized .'
p4719
aS'new world class ports will be developed along indias coast .'
p4720
aS'ports will be better connected to the hinterland through road and rail inland and coastal waterways will be developed as major transport routes .'
p4721
aS'low cost airports are being planned to improve regional connectivity , especially to tier-two towns and places of economic and tourist importance .'
p4722
aS'we are also keen to move towards the next generation infrastructure just as we need highways , we need i-ways too under the digital india initiative , it will be used to drive government processes to improve service delivery and program implementation , and also to provide broadband connectivity to villages .'
p4723
aS'to upgrade manufacturing infrastructure , we are setting up world-class investment and industrial regions along the dedicated freight corridors and industrial corridors government of india is working towards single window clearance at the federal and state levels .'
p4724
aS'four months back , we launched make in india initiative to encourage the growth of manufacturing in the country .'
p4725
aS'we are working hard to make india a global manufacturing hub .'
p4726
aS'we are promoting , in particular , labour intensive manufacturing .'
p4727
aS'i have launched these initiatives in a campaign mode so that they force us in the government to make faster corrections .'
p4728
aS'they challenge us to do away with the red tape and become pro-active with this purpose , our applications and processes are being aggressively put online .'
p4729
aS'ease of doing business in india is a prime concern for you and us .'
p4730
aS'i assure you that we are working very seriously on these issues we want to make them : not only easier than earlier ; not only easier than the rest ; but , we want to make them the easiestfriends !'
p4731
aS'many of you might be interested to know - why india ?'
p4732
aS'india has three things to its credit - democracy , demography and demand .'
p4733
aS'this is what you are looking for .'
p4734
aS'and i am sure , you will not find all of them together at any other destination india offers you the potential of low cost manufacturing .'
p4735
aS'india has low cost and high quality manpower 65 % of our population is below 35 years of age .'
p4736
aS'we are trying to further harness these strengths through better management and good governance .'
p4737
aS'in the recently launched mars orbiter mission , everything was made indigenously in fact , most mission components were made in very small factories .'
p4738
aS'friends !'
p4739
aS'we have large number of hands to work .'
p4740
aS'and , we have even larger number of dreams to be realised .'
p4741
aS'therefore , employment opportunities are being enhanced by promoting manufacturing , agro-based industries , tourism as well as services we have undertaken labour reforms to encourage enterprise and to create a bigger job market for our youth .'
p4742
aS'i have always said that development process should benefit the common man as well as the business sector .'
p4743
aS'therefore , my government has established a new ministry for skill development to enhance our human resource potential .'
p4744
aS'for this , we are placing equal emphasis on knowledge , technology , innovation and research and development .'
p4745
aS'this includes the use of ict for improving governance and resource management .'
p4746
aS'i understand this because .'
p4747
aS'i use modern tools of communication myself .'
p4748
aS'friends !'
p4749
aS'today , india is a land of opportunities .'
p4750
aS'we have to build fast track roads and railways .'
p4751
aS'we have to energise homes and factories on a continuous basis .'
p4752
aS'we have to build infrastructure for cities where almost half of our population lives .'
p4753
aS'we have to take the taste of modern amenities to every village .'
p4754
aS'we have to propel our growth through value addition in our natural resources and agri-produce .'
p4755
aS'we have to provide services to our people which are of global standards .'
p4756
aS'at the same time , the whole world is looking for certain services .'
p4757
aS'if our human resource can be equipped with skills and technology , we may serve the world in many areas .'
p4758
aS'thus , there are immense possibilities for global investors in india the process of development we are taking up is not incremental we are planning to take a quantum leap .'
p4759
aS'it is not limited to one sector or region , it is truly unlimited .'
p4760
aS'and we want to do things in a cleaner and greener way .'
p4761
aS'we are open to ideas , investments and innovations .'
p4762
aS'friends !'
p4763
aS'we have made commitments to our peoplewe have made commitments to ourselveswe have made commitments for indias great futurewe have to write our new destinyand we have to write it in a very short timewe know that to do this , we need an enabling policy framework we are working constantly to improve it further .'
p4764
aS'however , i can say with confidence that even today , the strength of indian democracy and independence of our judicial system provide a level playing field for long lasting business .'
p4765
aS'i would conclude by saying that- we are dreaming big ; and our dreams are numerous ; our dreams can become the seeds of your growth ; our aspirations can propel your ambitionsfriends !'
p4766
aS'on behalf of the government , let me give an assurance we assure you that we will be available to hold your hands whenever you need us .'

aa(lp4770
S'my colleague shri arun jaitley jishri vineet jainfriends from india and abroad , i am happy to be here today , to address the global business summit .'
p4771
aS'this is a good platform , for bringing together economists and industry leaders .'
p4772
aS'i compliment the economic times for organising this event .'
p4773
aS'over the next two days , you will debate growth and inflation , manufacturing and infrastructure , missed chances and unlimited possibilities .'
p4774
aS'you will see india as a country of opportunities , unmatched across the world .'
p4775
aS'i assure you that your inputs shall receive my governments highest attention .'
p4776
aS'friends , ( makar sankranti ) was celebrated on 14 january .'
p4777
aS'it is an important festival .'
p4778
aS'it is the beginning of ( uttarayan ) , which is considered to be a ( punya kaal ) .'
p4779
aS'the ( lohri ) festival also coincides with it .'
p4780
aS'on this day , the sun begins its journey north .'
p4781
aS'this marks the transition from winter to spring .'
p4782
aS'the new age india has also begun its transition ; from a winter of subdued achievements lasting 3 to 4 years , to a new spring that beckons .'
p4783
aS'the country had fallen into deep despair , with two back-to-back years of below 4 % growth , and governance at rock bottom .'
p4784
aS'a series of scams , from telecom to coal had paralysed the economy .'
p4785
aS'we deviated from the dream of india as a land of opportunity .'
p4786
aS'no longer can we afford the flight of capital and labour , for lack of opportunity .'
p4787
aS'we have to repair the damage that has happened .'
p4788
aS'restoring growth momentum will be an uphill task .'
p4789
aS'it will take hard work , sustained commitment and strong administrative action .'
p4790
aS'but we can overcome the mood of despair .'
p4791
aS'and we must .'
p4792
aS'it is in this context that all the steps we have taken must be seen .'
p4793
aS'friends , destiny has favoured me to serve this great nation .'
p4794
aS'mahatma gandhi said that we should not rest until we wipe every tear from every eye .'
p4795
aS'elimination of poverty is fundamental to me .'
p4796
aS'this is at the core of my understanding of cohesive growth .'
p4797
aS'to translate this vision into the reality of a new age india , we must be clear about our economic goals and objectives .'
p4798
aS'the government must nurture an eco-system : where the economy is primed for growth ; ando growth promotes all-round development ; where development is employment-generating ; ando employment is enabled by skills ; where skills are synced with production ; ando production is benchmarked to quality ; where quality meets global standards ; ando meeting global standards drives prosperitymost importantly , this prosperity is for the welfare of all .'
p4799
aS'that is my concept of economic good governance and all round development .'
p4800
aS'it is up to us to create conditions for the people of india to blossom and create this new age india .'
p4801
aS'friends , let me outline what we are doing to usher in this new spring .'
p4802
aS'my government is moving fast in designing policies and laws to promote growth .'
p4803
aS'this is where i seek everybodys cooperation .'
p4804
aS'first , we are committed to achieving the fiscal deficit target announced in the budget .'
p4805
aS'we have worked systematically in this direction .'
p4806
aS'many of you practise kaizen in your companies .'
p4807
aS'reducing wastage means cutting excess and preventing misuse .'
p4808
aS'this requires self-discipline .'
p4809
aS'that is why we have the expenditure management commission to suggest cuts in wasteful expenditure .'
p4810
aS'this way , we will make the rupee more productive , and deliver maximum bang for the buck .'
p4811
aS'second , the petroleum sector has seen major reforms .'
p4812
aS'diesel prices have been deregulated .'
p4813
aS'this has opened up space for private players to enter into petroleum retail .'
p4814
aS'gas prices have been linked to international prices .'
p4815
aS'this will bring a new wave of investment .'
p4816
aS'it will increase supplies .'
p4817
aS'it will resolve problems in the key power sector .'
p4818
aS'today , indias cooking gas subsidy is the worlds largest cash transfer programme .'
p4819
aS'over 80 million households receive subsidy directly as cash into their bank accounts .'
p4820
aS'this is one-third of all households in this country .'
p4821
aS'this will completely eliminate leakage .'
p4822
aS'building on this , we plan to introduce direct cash transfers in other benefit schemes .'
p4823
aS'third , inflation has been controlled through firm measures .'
p4824
aS'while falling oil prices helped , even non-oil inflation is at a very low level .'
p4825
aS'food inflation has come down from over 15 % a year ago to 3.'
p4826
aS'1 % last month .'
p4827
aS'the fall has been sharp since may 2014.'
p4828
aS'this set the stage for rbi to reduce interest rates , and push growth in a stable manner .'
p4829
aS'fourth , the consensus we arrived with states for amending the constitution to implement gst is a major breakthrough .'
p4830
aS'gst has been pending for over a decade .'
p4831
aS'this alone has the potential to make india competitive and attractive for investment .'
p4832
aS'fifth , the poor have been included in the financial system .'
p4833
aS'in a short span of 4 months , over 100 million new bank accounts have been opened under the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana .'
p4834
aS'for a country of our size , this was an immense challenge .'
p4835
aS'but with will , determination and the full support of every banker , we are today a nearly 100 % banked country .'
p4836
aS'soon , all accounts will be linked with aadhaar .'
p4837
aS'banking habits will become common across the country .'
p4838
aS'this now opens immense possibilities for the future .'
p4839
aS'peoples savings will rise .'
p4840
aS'they will invest in new financial instruments .'
p4841
aS'1.'
p4842
aS'2 billion people can hope for pensions and insurance .'
p4843
aS'as the nation progresses , these bank accounts will drive demand and growth .'
p4844
aS'we have always debated about social unity , national unity and so on .'
p4845
aS'but we have never debated about financial unity .'
p4846
aS'about bringing everyone into the financial system .'
p4847
aS'this is one cause which both capitalists and socialists agree on .'
p4848
aS'what , my friends , can be a bigger reform ?'
p4849
aS'sixth , the energy sector has been reformed .'
p4850
aS'coal blocks are now allocated transparently through auctions .'
p4851
aS'mining laws have been changed to facilitate efficient mining .'
p4852
aS'similar reforms are on the way in the power sector .'
p4853
aS'we have revived long pending projects in nepal and bhutan , with the cooperation of their governments .'
p4854
aS'steps are being taken to deliver 24 x 7 power for all , using every possible source , including renewable energy .'
p4855
aS'seventh , india is being made an attractive destination for investment .'
p4856
aS'fdi caps have been raised in insurance and real estate .'
p4857
aS'fdi and private investment are being promoted in defense and railways .'
p4858
aS'the land acquisition act has been amended to smoothen the process and speed up matters .'
p4859
aS'this will give a thrust to infrastructure and manufacturing , while protecting the compensation to farmers .'
p4860
aS'eighth , infrastructure is being given a boost .'
p4861
aS'greater investment is planned in railways and roads .'
p4862
aS'new approaches and instruments are being put in place to unlock their potential .'
p4863
aS'ninth , transparency and efficiency in governance , and institutional reforms are essential elements for rapid growth .'
p4864
aS'these , along with a positive regulatory framework , tax stability , and ease of doing business , are being pushed ahead at top speed .'
p4865
aS'for instance , i recently assured public sector banks they will have total autonomy in taking business decisions , without any interference from government on loans and their operations .'
p4866
aS'we need to use technology to deliver good governance .'
p4867
aS'whether it is a simple one like biometric-based attendance , which has improved office attendance and work culture .'
p4868
aS'or a cutting edge one , like space technology in mapping and planning .'
p4869
aS'i intend to launch a massive national program for pds computerisation .'
p4870
aS'the entire pds supply chain , from the fci godown to the ration shop and consumer will be computerised .'
p4871
aS'technology will drive welfare and efficient food delivery .'
p4872
aS'a major institutional reform is the move away from merely planning , to transforming india .'
p4873
aS'the setting up of the national institution for transforming india , niti aayog , is a step in this direction .'
p4874
aS'this will take the country forward on the path of cooperative federalism , with a competitive zeal .'
p4875
aS'the niti aayog is our mantra for creating trust and partnership between the centre and states .'
p4876
aS'this list can be endless .'
p4877
aS'i can go on for days , but i do not think we have the time .'
p4878
aS'however , i have given you a sense of the immense activity we are engaged in .'
p4879
aS'we have done a lot so far and more will be done in future .'
p4880
aS'friends , reforms are not an end in itself .'
p4881
aS'reforms must have a concrete objective .'
p4882
aS'the objective must be to improve the welfare of the people .'
p4883
aS'approaches may be many .'
p4884
aS'but the goal is one .'
p4885
aS'reforms may not be apparent to one and all at first sight .'
p4886
aS'but small acts can drive reforms .'
p4887
aS'what appears minor can actually be vital and fundamental .'
p4888
aS'further , there is no contradiction between doing big tickets items and doing small things .'
p4889
aS'one approach is to have new policies , programmes , large projects and path breaking changes .'
p4890
aS'another approach is to focus on the small things that matter , create a peoples movement and generate mass momentum , which then drives development .'
p4891
aS'we need to follow both paths .'
p4892
aS'let me explain this a bit .'
p4893
aS'generating 20,000 mw of power attracts a lot of attention .'
p4894
aS'that is important .'
p4895
aS'at the same time , 20,000 mw of power can be saved through a peoples movement for energy efficiency .'
p4896
aS'the end result is similar .'
p4897
aS'the second is more difficult but is as important as the first .'
p4898
aS'in the same way , improving a thousand primary schools is as important as opening a new university .'
p4899
aS'the new aiims we are setting up will improve public health in the same way as our promise of health assurance .'
p4900
aS'to me , health assurance is not a scheme .'
p4901
aS'it is about ensuring that every rupee spent on health is well spent ; that every citizen has access to proper healthcare .'
p4902
aS'similarly , when we do swachh bharat , it has multiple impacts .'
p4903
aS'it is not just a fad or a slogan .'
p4904
aS'it changes peoples mindsets .'
p4905
aS'it changes our lifestyle .'
p4906
aS'swachhata becomes a habit .'
p4907
aS'waste management generates economic activity .'
p4908
aS'it can create lakhs of swachhata entrepreneurs .'
p4909
aS'the nation gets identified with cleanliness .'
p4910
aS'and of course , it has a huge impact on health .'
p4911
aS'after all , diarrhoea and other diseases can not be defeated without swachhata !'
p4912
aS'the mantra of independence was ( satyagraha ) .'
p4913
aS'and the warriors were - ( satyagrahis ) .'
p4914
aS'the mantra of new age india must be - ( swachhagraha ) .'
p4915
aS'and the warriors will be - ( swachhagrahis ) .'
p4916
aS'take the case of tourism .'
p4917
aS'it is an untapped economic activity .'
p4918
aS'but tapping it requires a swachh bharat .'
p4919
aS'it needs improvement in infrastructure and telecom connectivity .'
p4920
aS'it requires better education and skill development .'
p4921
aS'therefore , a simple goal can generate reforms in multiple sectors .'
p4922
aS'people must understand the clean ganga program , as an economic activity also .'
p4923
aS'the gangetic plains account for 40 % of our population .'
p4924
aS'they have over one hundred towns , and thousands of villages .'
p4925
aS'improving ganga will develop new infrastructure .'
p4926
aS'it will promote tourism .'
p4927
aS'it will create a modern economy helping millions of people .'
p4928
aS'in addition , it preserves the environment !'
p4929
aS'railways is another example .'
p4930
aS'there are thousands of railway stations in the country where not more than 1 or 2 trains stop in a day .'
p4931
aS'these facilities , created at a cost , remain unused for most of the day .'
p4932
aS'these stations can become growth points for the nearby villages .'
p4933
aS'they can be used for skill development .'
p4934
aS'small indeed , is beautiful .'
p4935
aS'in agriculture too , our main goal is to raise productivity .'
p4936
aS'this will require using technology , increasing soil fertility , producing more crop per drop , and bringing the latest from lab to land .'
p4937
aS'cost of cultivation will go down as efficiency rises .'
p4938
aS'this will make agriculture viable .'
p4939
aS'on the output side , the entire value chain in agriculture will be addressed through better storage , transport and food processing linkages .'
p4940
aS'we will link farmers to global markets .'
p4941
aS'we will give the world the taste of india .'
p4942
aS'friends , i have often called for minimum government maximum governance .'
p4943
aS'this is not a slogan .'
p4944
aS'this is an important principle to transform india .'
p4945
aS'- government systems suffer from two weaknesses .'
p4946
aS'they are complex .'
p4947
aS'and they are slow .'
p4948
aS'in life , people go on a ( chaar dham yatra ) to get ( moksha ) .'
p4949
aS'in government , a file has to go to ( chattees dham ) , and yet not get ( moksha ) !'
p4950
aS'we need to change this .'
p4951
aS'our systems need to bemade sharp , effective , fast and flexible .'
p4952
aS'this requires simplification of processes and having trust in citizens .'
p4953
aS'this needs a policy driven state .'
p4954
aS'what is maximum governance , minimum government ?'
p4955
aS'it means government has no business to be in business .'
p4956
aS'there are many parts of the economy where the private sector will do better and deliver better .'
p4957
aS'in 20 years of liberalisation , we have not changed a command and control mindset .'
p4958
aS'we think it is okay for government to meddle in the working of firms .'
p4959
aS'this must change .'
p4960
aS'but this is not a call for anarchy .'
p4961
aS'first , we need to focus government upon the things that are required of the state .'
p4962
aS'second , we need to achieve competence in government so that the state delivers on the things it sets out to do .'
p4963
aS'why do we need the state ?'
p4964
aS'there are 5 main components : the first is public goods such as defence , police , and judiciary .'
p4965
aS'the second is externalities which hurt others , such as pollution .'
p4966
aS'for this , we need a regulatory system .'
p4967
aS'the third is market power ; where monopolies need controlsthe fourth is information gaps ; where you need someone to ensure that medicines are genuine and so on .'
p4968
aS'last , we need a well designed welfare and subsidy mechanism to ensure that the bottom of society is protected from deprivation .'
p4969
aS'this specially includes education and healthcare .'
p4970
aS'these are five places where we require government .'
p4971
aS'in the five areas where we need government , we require competent , efficient and non-corrupt arms of government .'
p4972
aS'we in government , must constantly ask the question : how much money am i spending , and what outcomes am i getting in return ?'
p4973
aS'for this , government agencies have to be improved to become competent .'
p4974
aS'this requires rewriting some laws .'
p4975
aS'laws are the dna of government .'
p4976
aS'they must evolve with time .'
p4977
aS'india is a 2 trillion dollar economy today .'
p4978
aS'can we not dream of an india with a 20 trillion dollar economy ?'
p4979
aS'should we not create the environment for this to happen ?'
p4980
aS'we are preparing the ground for it .'
p4981
aS'this is hard work .'
p4982
aS'quick and easy reforms will not be enough for creating a fast growing economy .'
p4983
aS'that is our challenge and that is what we aim to do .'
p4984
aS'digital india and skill india are attempts in this direction .'
p4985
aS'digital india will reform government systems , eliminate waste , increase access and empower citizens .'
p4986
aS'it will drive the next wave of growth , which will be knowledge-driven .'
p4987
aS'broadband in every village , with a wide range of online services , will transform india in a manner we can not foresee .'
p4988
aS'skill india will harness the demographic dividend which everyone talks of .'
p4989
aS'friends , improvement in governance is a continuous process .'
p4990
aS'we are making changes wherever acts , rules and procedures are not in tune with needs .'
p4991
aS'we are cutting down on multiple clearances that choke investment .'
p4992
aS'our complex tax system is crying for reform , which we have initiated .'
p4993
aS'i believe in speed .'
p4994
aS'i will push through change at a fast pace .'
p4995
aS'you will appreciate this in times to come .'
p4996
aS'at the same time , we need to take care of the poor , deprived and left behind sections of society .'
p4997
aS'i believe that subsidies are needed for them .'
p4998
aS'what we need is a well targeted system of subsidy delivery .'
p4999
aS'we need to cut subsidy leakages , not subsidies themselves .'
p5000
aS'wastage , as i said earlier , must be removed in subsidies .'
p5001
aS'the target group should be clearly identified and the subsidies should be well delivered .'
p5002
aS'the ultimate objective of subsidies should be to empower the poor , to break the cycle of poverty , and become foot-soldiers in our war on poverty .'
p5003
aS'at this point , i would also say that development has to result in jobs .'
p5004
aS'reforms , economic growth , progress all are empty words if they do not translate into jobs .'
p5005
aS'what we need is not just more production , but mass production and production by masses .'
p5006
aS'friends , economic development can not take a nation forward on its own .'
p5007
aS'development has many dimensions .'
p5008
aS'while on one hand we need higher incomes , we also need a society which is cohesive .'
p5009
aS'which balances the stress and strain of a modern economy .'
p5010
aS'history is witness to the rise and fall of nations .'
p5011
aS'even now , many countries have become rich in an economic sense , but are poor in a social sense .'
p5012
aS'their family systems , value systems , social networks and other elements which hold a society together have broken .'
p5013
aS'we should not go down that path .'
p5014
aS'we need a society and economy which complement each other .'
p5015
aS'that is the only way for a nation to go forward .'
p5016
aS'further , development seems to have become the agenda only of government .'
p5017
aS'it is seen as a scheme .'
p5018
aS'that should not be the case .'
p5019
aS'development should be everyones agenda .'
p5020
aS'it should be a peoples movement .'
p5021
aS'friends , like the rest of the world , we are concerned about two dangers - terrorism and climate change .'
p5022
aS'together , we will find a way to face these .'
p5023
aS'today , everyone is looking towards asia for inspiration and growth .'
p5024
aS'and within asia , india is important .'
p5025
aS'not just for its size , but for its democracy , and its values .'
p5026
aS'indias core philosophy is ( sarva mangala maangalyam ) and ( sarve bhavantu sukhinah ) .'
p5027
aS'this is a call for global welfare , global cooperation and balanced living .'
p5028
aS'india can be a role model of growth and cohesiveness for the rest of the world .'
p5029
aS'for this , we need a workforce and economy which meet global needs and expectations .'
p5030
aS'we need to quickly improve social indicators .'
p5031
aS'india should no longer be bracketed with the least developed .'
p5032
aS'we can do this .'
p5033
aS'swami vivekananda had said arise , awake , do not stop until the goal has been attained .'
p5034
aS'this should inspire us all to achieve the vision of a new age india .'
p5035
aS'together , we can !'
p5036
aS'thank you .'

S'today , shri barack obama , president of the united states , joins us in a special programme of mann ki baat .'
p5039
aS"for the last few months , i have been sharing my  mann ki baat '' with you ."
p5040
aS'but today , people from various parts of the country have asked questions .'
p5041
aS'but most of the questions are connected to politics , foreign policy , economic policy .'
p5042
aS'however , some questions touch the heart .'
p5043
aS'and i believe if we touch those questions today , we shall be able to reach out to the common man in different parts of the country .'
p5044
aS'and therefore , the questions asked in press conferences , or discussed in meetings instead of those if we discuss what comes from the heart , and repeat it , hum it , we get a new energy .'
p5045
aS'and therefore , in my opinion , those questions are more important .'
p5046
aS"some people wonder , what does  barack '' mean ?"
p5047
aS'i was searching for the meaning of barack .'
p5048
aS'in swahili language , which is spoken in parts of africa , barack means , one who is blessed .'
p5049
aS'i believe , along with a name , his family gave him a big gift .'
p5050
aS'african countries have lived by the ancient idea of ubuntu , which alludes to the oneness in humanity .'
p5051
aS'they say i am , because we are .'
p5052
aS'despite the gap in centuries and borders , there is the same spirit of vasudhaiva kutumbakam , which speak of in india .'
p5053
aS'this is the great shared heritage of humanity .'
p5054
aS'this unites us .'
p5055
aS'when we discuss mahatma gandhi , we remember henry thoreau , from whom mahatma gandhi learnt disobedience .'
p5056
aS'when we talk about martin luther king or obama , we hear from their lips , respect for mahatma gandhi .'
p5057
aS'these are the things that unite the world .'
p5058
aS'today , barack obama is with us .'
p5059
aS'i will first request him to share his thoughts .'
p5060
aS'then , i and barack will both answer the questions that have been addressed to us .'
p5061
aS'it is true that when i first went to america , i was not lucky enough to visit the white house .'
p5062
aS'there is an iron fence far from the white house .'
p5063
aS'we stood outside the fence and took a photograph .'
p5064
aS'white house is visible in the background .'
p5065
aS'now that i have become prime minister , that photo too has become popular .'
p5066
aS'but at that time , i had never thought that sometime in my life , i would get a chance to visit the white house .'
p5067
aS'but when i visited the white house , one thing touched my heart .'
p5068
aS'i can never forget that .'
p5069
aS'barack gave me a book , a book that he had located after considerable effort .'
p5070
aS'that book had become famous in 1894 .'
p5071
aS'swami vivekananda , the inspiration of my life , had gone to chicago to participate in the world religions conference .'
p5072
aS'and this book was a compilation of the speeches delivered at the world religions conference .'
p5073
aS'that touched my heart .'
p5074
aS'and not just this .'
p5075
aS'he turned the pages of the book , and showed me what was written there .'
p5076
aS'he had gone through the entire book !'
p5077
aS'and he told me with pride , i come from the chicago where swami vivekananda had come .'
p5078
aS'these words touched my heart a lot .'
p5079
aS'and i will treasure this throughout my life .'
p5080
aS'so once , standing far from the white house and taking a photo , and then , to visit the white house , and to receive a book on someone whom i respect .'
p5081
aS'you can imagine , how it would have touched my heart .'
p5082
aS'no .'
p5083
aS'i never imagined it .'
p5084
aS'because , as barack said , i come from a very ordinary family .'
p5085
aS'but for a long time , i have been telling everyone , never dream of becoming something .'
p5086
aS'if you wish to dream , dream of doing something .'
p5087
aS'when we do something , we get satisfaction , and also get inspiration to do something new .'
p5088
aS'if we only dream of becoming something , and can not fulfil the dream , then we only get disappointed .'
p5089
aS'and therefore , i never dreamt of becoming something .'
p5090
aS'even today , i have no dream of becoming something .'
p5091
aS'but i do dream of doing something .'
p5092
aS'serving mother india , serving 125 crore indians , there can be no greater dream than this .'
p5093
aS'that is what i have to do .'
p5094
aS'when i was young , i used to see kennedys pictures in indian newspapers .'
p5095
aS'his personality was very impressive .'
p5096
aS'but your question is , who has inspired me .'
p5097
aS'i liked reading as a child .'
p5098
aS'and i got an opportunity to read the biography of benjamin franklin .'
p5099
aS'he lived in the eighteenth century .'
p5100
aS'and he was not an american president .'
p5101
aS'but his biography is so inspiring how a person can intelligently try to change his life .'
p5102
aS'if we feel excessively sleepy , how can we reduce that ?'
p5103
aS'if we feel like eating too much , how can we work towards eating less ?'
p5104
aS'if people get upset with you that can not meet them , because of the pressure of work , then how to solve this problem ?'
p5105
aS'he has addressed such issues in his biography .'
p5106
aS'and i tell everyone , we should read benjamin franklins biography .'
p5107
aS'even today , it inspires me .'
p5108
aS'and benjamin franklin had a multi-dimensional personality .'
p5109
aS'he was a politician , he was a political scientist , he was a social worker , he was a diplomat .'
p5110
aS'and he came from an ordinary family .'
p5111
aS'he could not even complete his education .'
p5112
aS'but till today , his thoughts have an impact on american life .'
p5113
aS'i find his life truly inspiring .'
p5114
aS'and i tell you too , if you read his biography , you will find ways to transform your life too .'
p5115
aS'and he has talked about simple things .'
p5116
aS'so i feel you will be inspired as much as i have been .'
p5117
aS'indeed barack has spoken words from the heart ( mann ki baat ) .'
p5118
aS'whatever position we may hold , we are human too .'
p5119
aS'simple things can inspire us .'
p5120
aS'i also wish to narrate an experience .'
p5121
aS'for many years , i was like an ascetic .'
p5122
aS'i got food at other peoples homes .'
p5123
aS'whoever invited me , used to feed me as well .'
p5124
aS'once a family invited me over for a meal , repeatedly .'
p5125
aS'i would not go , because i felt they are too poor , and if i go to eat at their place , i will become a burden on them .'
p5126
aS'but eventually , i had to bow to their request and love .'
p5127
aS'and i went to eat a meal at their home .'
p5128
aS'it was a small hut , where we sat down to eat .'
p5129
aS'they offered me roti made of bajra ( millet ) , and mik .'
p5130
aS'their young child was looking at the milk .'
p5131
aS'i felt , the child has never even seen milk .'
p5132
aS'so i gave that small bowl of milk to the child .'
p5133
aS'and he drank it within seconds .'
p5134
aS'his family members were angry with him .'
p5135
aS'and i felt that perhaps that child has never had any milk , apart from his mothers milk .'
p5136
aS'and maybe , they had bought milk so that i could have a good meal .'
p5137
aS'this incident inspired me a lot .'
p5138
aS'a poor person living in a hut could think so much about my well-being .'
p5139
aS'so i should devote my life to their service .'
p5140
aS'so these are the things that serve as inspiration .'
p5141
aS'and barack has also spoken about what can touch the heart .'
p5142
aS'i am thankful to barack , he has given so much time .'
p5143
aS'and i am thankful to my countrymen for listening to mann ki baat .'
p5144
aS'i know radio reaches every home and every lane of india .'
p5145
aS'and this mann ki baat , this special mann ki baat will echo forever .'
p5146
aS'i have an idea .'
p5147
aS'i share it with you .'
p5148
aS'there should be an e-book made of the talk between barack and me today .'
p5149
aS'i hope the organizers of mann ki baat will release this e-book .'
p5150
aS'and to you all , who have listened to mann ki baat , i also say , do participate in this .'
p5151
aS'and the best hundred thoughts that emerge out of this , will also be added to this e-book .'
p5152
aS'and i want you to write to us on twitter , on facebook , or online , using the hashtag # yeswecan.'
p5153
aS'- eliminate poverty - # yeswecan - quality healthcare to all - # yeswecan - youth empowered with education - # yeswecan - jobs for all - # yeswecan - end to terrorism - # yeswecan - global peace and progress - # yeswecani want you to send your thoughts , experiences and feelings after listening to mann ki baat .'
p5154
aS'from them , we will select the best hundred , and we will add them to the book containing the talk that barack and i have had .'
p5155
aS'and i believe , this will truly become , the mann ki baat of us all .'
p5156
aS'once again , a big thank you to barack .'
p5157
aS'and to all of you .'
p5158
aS'baracks visit to india on this pious occasion of 26th january , is a matter of pride for me and for the country .'
p5159
aS'thank you very much .'

p5183
aS'the bilateral agreement on civil nuclear cooperation is yet another demonstration of our mutual trust .'
p5184
aS'this is the first such agreement sri lanka has signed .'
p5185
aS'it opens new avenues for cooperation , including in areas like agriculture and healthcare .'
p5186
aS'president and i also agreed to expand our defence and security cooperation .'
p5187
aS'we welcomed the progress in our maritime security cooperation , including in the trilateral format with maldives .'

p5196
aS'we agreed that there must be a constructive and humanitarian approach to the issue .'
p5197
aS'we will encourage the fishermens associations on both sides to meet again soon .'
p5198

p5217
aS'the whole country is proud of their recognition .'
p5218
aS'their elevation was preceded by that of saint alphonsa , who also hailed from kerala .'
p5219
aS'the life and deeds of saint chavara and saint euphresia are an inspiration not only to the christian community , but to humanity as a whole .'
p5220
aS'they are shining examples of dedication to god through selfless service for the betterment of mankind .'
p5221
aS'saint chavara was a man of prayer and also a social reformer .'
p5222
aS'in an era when access to education was limited , he stressed that every church should have a school .'
p5223
aS'he thus opened the doors of education to people from all sections of society .'
p5224
aS'few outside kerala know that he started a sanskrit school , and also a printing press .'
p5225
aS'his contribution towards womens empowerment was also noteworthy .'
p5226
aS'saint euphrasia was a mystic who dedicated her life to prayer and devotion to god .'
p5227
aS'both these saints dedicated their life to god through service of fellow beings .'
p5228
aS'the ancient indian saying : welfare of the world is the way to moksha ( salvation ) explains their life .'
p5229
aS'friends , spiritualism is rooted in indias heritage .'
p5230
aS'indian saints and greek sages had intellectual and spiritual exchanges thousands of years back .'
p5231
aS'indias openness to new ideas is manifest in the rig veda : let noble thoughts come to us from all sides .'
p5232
aS'this philosophy has guided our intellectual discourse since time immemorial .'
p5233
aS'mother india gave birth to many religious and spiritual streams .'
p5234
aS'some of them have even travelled beyond indian borders .'
p5235
aS'the tradition of welcoming , respecting and honouring all faiths is as old as india itself .'
p5236
aS'as swami vivekananda said : we believe not only in universal toleration , but we accept all religions as true .'
p5237
aS'what swami vivekananda had said a century ago holds good and will , for ever , not only for this nation but also for this government or for that matter any government in india , run by any political party .'
p5238
aS'this principle of equal respect and treatment for all faiths has been a part of indias ethos for thousands of years .'
p5239
aS'and that is how it became integral to the constitution of india .'
p5240
aS'our constitution did not evolve in a vacuum .'
p5241
aS'it has roots in the ancient cultural traditions of india .'
p5242
aS'gurudev rabindranath tagore had inspired us to dream of a land where the mind is without fear and the head is held high .'
p5243
aS'it is that heaven of freedom we are duty bound to create and preserve .'
p5244
aS'we believe that there is truth in every religion .'
p5245
aS'friends , let me now come to the issue which is central and critical for peace and harmony in the contemporary world .'
p5246
aS'the world is increasingly witnessing division and hostility on religious lines .'
p5247
aS'this has become a matter of global concern .'
p5248
aS'in this context the ancient indian plea of mutual respect for all faiths is now beginning to manifest in global discourse .'
p5249
aS'this long felt need and urge for mutually respectful relations led to the interfaith conference on faith in human rights at the hague on tenth december , 2008 .'
p5250
aS'this was coincidentally also the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights by the united nations .'
p5251
aS'religious leaders representing every major world religion - christianity , hinduism , judaism , bahai faith , buddhism , islam , taoism and indigenous religions met , discussed and pledged to uphold the universal declaration and of freedom of religion or belief .'
p5252
aS'in their historic declaration , this is how they defined what constitutes freedom of faith and how it is to be safeguarded .'
p5253
aS'we consider the freedom to have , to retain , and to adopt , a religion or belief , is a personal choice of a citizen .'
p5254
aS'the world is at cross roads which , if not crossed properly , can throw us back to the dark days of bigotry , fanaticism and bloodshed .'
p5255
aS'this harmonious convergence among religions could not be achieved even when the world entered the third millennium .'
p5256
aS'and now it has been .'
p5257
aS'this shows that the rest of the world too is evolving along the lines of ancient india .'
p5258
aS'speaking for india , and for my government , i declare that my government stands by every word of the above declaration .'
p5259
aS'my government will ensure that there is complete freedom of faith and that everyone has the undeniable right to retain or adopt the religion of his or her choice without coercion or undue influence .'
p5260
aS'my government will not allow any religious group , belonging to the majority or the minority , to incite hatred against others , overtly or covertly .'
p5261
aS'mine will be a government that gives equal respect to all religions .'
p5262
aS'india is the land of buddha and gandhi .'
p5263
aS'equal respect for all religions must be in the dna of every indian .'
p5264
aS'we can not accept violence against any religion on any pretext and i strongly condemn such violence .'
p5265
aS'my government will act strongly in this regard .'
p5266
aS'with this commitment , i appeal to all religious groups to act with restraint , mutual respect , and tolerance in the true spirit of this ancient nation which is manifest in our constitution and is in line with the hague declaration .'
p5267
aS'friends , i have a vision of a modern india .'
p5268
aS'i have embarked on a huge mission to convert that vision into reality .'
p5269
aS'my mantra is development - , .'
p5270
aS'in simple terms it means food on every table , every child in school , a job for everybody and a house with toilet and electricity for every family .'
p5271
aS'this will make india proud .'
p5272
aS'we can achieve this through unity .'
p5273
aS'unity strengthens us .'
p5274
aS'division weakens us .'
p5275
aS'i sincerely request all indians , and all of you present here to support me in this huge task .'
p5276
aS'let the elevation to sainthood of saint chavara and saint euphrasia , and their noble deeds inspire us : -to maximize our inner strength -to use that strength for transforming society through selfless service -to fulfil our collective vision of a developed and modern india .'
p5277
aS'thank you .'

aa(lp5279
S'my ministerial colleagues , distinguished participants and guestsi am delighted to participate in the 10th edition of aero india .'
p5280
aS'more than 250 indian companies and more than 300 foreign firms are here .'
p5281
aS'there are defence ministers , senior officials and hundreds of business leaders from around the world .'
p5282
aS'a big welcome to each of you !'
p5283
aS'this is the largest ever aero india .'
p5284
aS'this reflects a new level of confidence within our country and global interest in india .'
p5285
aS'to many of you , india is a major business opportunity .'
p5286
aS'we have the reputation as the largest importer of defence equipment in the world .'
p5287
aS'that may be music to the ears of some of you here .'
p5288
aS'but , this is one area where we would not like to be number one !'
p5289
aS'our security challenges are well known .'
p5290
aS'our international responsibilities are evident .'
p5291
aS'we do need to increase our defence preparedness .'
p5292
aS'we do have to modernize our defence forces .'
p5293
aS'we have to equip ourselves for the needs of the future , where technology will play a major role .'
p5294
aS'as a nation of one billion people , we also have huge requirements for managing internal security .'
p5295
aS'we are increasingly integrating technology and systems into it .'
p5296
aS'these opportunities make aero india an important international event .'
p5297
aS'for me , this is not just a trade fair for defence equipment .'
p5298
aS'this is a mega meeting of one of the largest global supply chains , with the most advanced technology and complex equipmentand , a platform to launch indias defence manufacturing sector .'
p5299
aS'a nation with a strong defence industry will not only be more secure .'
p5300
aS'it will also reap rich economic benefits .'
p5301
aS'it can boost investment , expand manufacturing , support enterprise , raise the technology level and increase economic growth in the country .'
p5302
aS'in india , the defence industry in the government sector alone employs nearly 200,000 workers and thousands of engineers and scientists .'
p5303
aS'they produce an output of nearly 7 billion dollars annually .'
p5304
aS'it also supports a very large pool of small and medium enterprises .'
p5305
aS'our defence industry in private sector is still small .'
p5306
aS'but , it already employs thousands of people .'
p5307
aS'this is despite the fact that nearly 60 % of our defence equipment continues to be imported .'
p5308
aS'and , we are spending tens of billions of dollars on acquisitions from abroad .'
p5309
aS'there are studies that show that even a 20 to 25 % reduction in imports could directly create an additional 100,000 to 120,000 highly skilled jobs in india .'
p5310
aS'if we could raise the percentage of domestic procurement from 40 % to 70 % in the next five years , we would double the output in our defence industry .'
p5311
aS'imagine the impact in terms of jobs created directly and in the related manufacturing and services sector !'
p5312
aS'think of the spin off benefits on other sectors in terms of advanced materials and technologies !'
p5313
aS'that is why we are focusing on developing indias defence industry with a sense of mission .'
p5314
aS'this is why it is at the heart of our make in india programme .'
p5315
aS'we are reforming our defence procurement policies and procedures .'
p5316
aS'there would be a clear preference for equipment manufactured in india .'
p5317
aS'our procurement procedures will ensure simplicity , accountability and speedy decision making .'
p5318
aS'we have raised the permitted level of foreign direct investment to 49 % .'
p5319
aS'this can go higher , if the project brings state-of-the art technology .'
p5320
aS'we have permitted investments up to 24 % by foreign institutional investments .'
p5321
aS'and , there is no longer a need to have a single indian investor with at least a 51 % stake .'
p5322
aS'industrial licensing requirements have been eliminated for a number of items .'
p5323
aS'where it is needed , the process has been simplified .'
p5324
aS'we are expanding the role of private sector , even for major platforms .'
p5325
aS'our goal is to provide a level playing field for all .'
p5326
aS'we speak in terms of national capacity , not public sector or private sector .'
p5327
aS'offsets system is a crucial instrument to develop and upgrade our defence industry .'
p5328
aS'we have introduced significant reforms in our offsets policy .'
p5329
aS'i am acutely aware that it still needs a lot of improvements .'
p5330
aS'we will pursue them in consultation with domestic industry and our foreign partners .'
p5331
aS'i want our offsets policy not as a means to export low-end products , but to acquire state-of-the art technology and skills in core areas of priority .'
p5332
aS'governments support for research and development is essential for defence sector .'
p5333
aS'and , it should also be accompanied by a degree of assurance on purchase .'
p5334
aS'we are introducing a scheme to provide up to 80 % of funding from the government for development of a prototype in india .'
p5335
aS'and , we are also launching a technology development fund .'
p5336
aS'for too long , our research and development has been confined to government laboratories .'
p5337
aS'we must involve our scientists , soldiers , academia , industry and independent experts more closely in research and development .'
p5338
aS'last month at the army day reception , i had asked to meet our officers and soldiers , who had made the best innovations in our defence equipment .'
p5339
aS'i was impressed with what i saw .'
p5340
aS'finally , we have made our export policies clearer , simpler and predictable .'
p5341
aS'but , we will also abide by the highest standards of export controls and international responsibility .'
p5342
aS'we will expand our exports , but we will ensure that our equipment and technology do not fall into the wrong hands .'
p5343
aS'indias record in this area has been impeccable and it will remain so .'
p5344
aS'i am pleased with the positive impact of our policies .'
p5345
aS'indian private corporations have responded with enthusiasm .'
p5346
aS'there is new excitement in our small and medium scale sector .'
p5347
aS'many of the biggest global firms are forming strategic partnerships in india .'
p5348
aS'some of them have already begun using india as part of their global supply chains or engineering services .'
p5349
aS'in september 2014 dynamatic technologies and its collaborator boeing inaugurated a plant in india to manufacture critical parts for a boeing helicopter that is sold globally .'
p5350
aS'i understand that it was a day after make in india was launched .'
p5351
aS'i am pleased to learn that the first set of parts is ready for shipment today .'
p5352
aS'but , we still need to do more .'
p5353
aS'we have to further reform our acquisition and approval processes .'
p5354
aS'we must indicate a clear roadmap of our future needs .'
p5355
aS'this must take into account not only new technology trends , but also the nature of future challenges .'
p5356
aS'we must pay attention to developing supply chains , with emphasis on innovation .'
p5357
aS'we must bridge the gap between prototype development and quality of production .'
p5358
aS'we must develop a financing system suited to the special needs of this industry .'
p5359
aS'it is a market where buyers are mainly governments , the capital investments are large and the risks are high .'
p5360
aS'we must ensure that our tax system does not discriminate against domestic manufacture in comparison to imports .'
p5361
aS'more broadly , our defence industry will succeed more if we can transform the manufacturing sector in india .'
p5362
aS'we need great infrastructure , sound business climate , clear investment policies , ease of doing business , stable and predictable tax regime , and easy access to inputs .'
p5363
aS'we need a national industry that produces advanced materials , the most sophisticated electronics and the best engineering products .'
p5364
aS'over the last eight months , we have worked hard to create that environment for you .'
p5365
aS'above all , we need a vast pool of highly skilled and qualified human resources for the defence industry .'
p5366
aS'our aerospace industry alone would need about 200,000 people in another ten years .'
p5367
aS'we will set up special universities and skill development centres to cater to our defence industry , just as we have done in atomic energy and space .'
p5368
aS'i have especially invited the state governments to come here with package of facilities to attract investments in defence manufacturing .'
p5369
aS'distinguished guests , this is a new era for the defence industry in india .'
p5370
aS'it will be no longer enough to buy equipment and simply assemble them here .'
p5371
aS'we have been doing this in the past , without absorbing any technology or developing our own capabilities .'
p5372
aS'in some areas , we are where we were three decades ago .'
p5373
aS'frankly , our public sector needs to do much better than they are doing now .'
p5374
aS'we have to exploit their huge assets and a vast potential .'
p5375
aS'at the same time , we have to make them accountable .'
p5376
aS'we want to develop an industry is dynamic .'
p5377
aS'it should constantly stay at the cutting edge of the global industry .'
p5378
aS'i am confident that india will emerge as a major global centre for defence industry .'
p5379
aS'we have the basic building blocks for it in india ; and , a large nation requirement .'
p5380
aS'we will build an industry that will have room for everyone public sector , private sector and foreign firms .'
p5381
aS'from sellers , foreign firms must turn into strategic partners .'
p5382
aS'we need their technology , skills , systems integration and manufacturing strength .'
p5383
aS'the nature of industry is such that imports will always be there .'
p5384
aS'in turn , they can use india as part of their global supply chain .'
p5385
aS'defence budgets around the world are becoming tighter .'
p5386
aS'indias frugal but sophisticated manufacturing and engineering services sectors can help reduce costs .'
p5387
aS'india can also be a base for export to third countries , especially because of indias growing defence partnerships in asia and beyond .'
p5388
aS'a strong indian defence industry will not only make india more secure .'
p5389
aS'it will also make india more prosperous .'
p5390
aS'aero india can be a catalyst in realizing our goals .'
p5391
aS'that is why i am here today .'
p5392
aS'so , as we look at these wonderful aircraft and enjoy the amazing fly pasts , i also hope we can get some business done .'
p5393
aS'and , sow the seeds of successful new ventures and partnerships to give our people new opportunities , to make our nations safer , and the world more stable and peaceful .'
p5394
aS'thank you .'
p5395
aa(lp5396
S'hello , my young friends .'
p5397
aS'today probably the entire day you must have been preoccupied with the ongoing cricket match .'
p5398
aS'on the one hand you have exams and on the other this world cup , you might be asking your younger sister to tell you the score of the match from time to time .'
p5399
aS'sometimes you must be elated about the fact that holi is around the corner and then suddenly you would be feeling disappointed that even holi festivities will go in for a toss .'
p5400
aS'why ?'
p5401
aS'because the exams are approaching and i am sure you must be feeling this way .'
p5402
aS'but friends , i am there with you in your moment of crisis .'
p5403
aS'this is an important occasion for you ; hence i am there to offer my support .'
p5404
aS'i am not here to lecture you ; i intend to have some light conversations with you .'
p5405
aS'you have been studying hard and you are tired .'
p5406
aS'mother scolds you and so does your father and teachers .'
p5407
aS'god only knows what all you have to hear day in and out .'
p5408
aS'keep the phone , switch off the tv , entire day you are glued to the computer- everyday you must be hearing the same things .'
p5409
aS'be it the class x or the class xii , the whole year long you might be getting to hear the same things .'
p5410
aS'and you might be sincerely wishing that sooner the exams finish better it will be , isnt it ?'
p5411
aS'i understand your mental condition and hence i am here to share mann ki baat with you .'
p5412
aS'but this topic is a little difficult .'
p5413
aS'as far as todays topic is concerned , the parents might be wishing that i touch those issues that they can not discuss with their children .'
p5414
aS'teachers must be wishing that i say the right things to the kids and the students might be wishing that i say things which might ease the pressure at home .'
p5415
aS'i do not know who will benefit from my conversation but i will have the satisfaction to know that i was there with my young friends in the most important occasion of their life , that i was sharing my inner feelings with them .'
p5416
aS'this is my idea behind the conversations .'
p5417
aS'i do not have the right to guide you on how to write a paper or how to pass the exams well .'
p5418
aS'i can not guide you on the tricks to obtain better marks because i consider myself an average student on such issues .'
p5419
aS'i have myself never scored well in any exams in my life .'
p5420
aS'i was a very average student and on top of that i had a very bad handwriting .'
p5421
aS'so i think that most of the time i passed the exams as the teachers could not comprehend my handwriting .'
p5422
aS'well so much for the light talks .'
p5423
aS'but today i want to definitely tell you something important .'
p5424
aS'how you approach exams goes a long way in deciding the results of your exams .'
p5425
aS'there are many people i have seen who view this as the most important challenge of their lives and they believe that a failure here means failure for life .'
p5426
aS'but friends , this is not so , and so dont take undue stress .'
p5427
aS'yes , you must be determined to get good results .'
p5428
aS'the determination should be strong and the motivation high .'
p5429
aS'but the exams should not be a burden .'
p5430
aS'this is not the exam which is going to test your performance in life .'
p5431
aS'so do not bother much about it .'
p5432
aS'sometimes , dont you think we tend to make exams a huge burden and the reason behind this is that if we have friends and relatives who have children studying in the same class as your child , if your child and your relatives child are also in class tenth , then there is constant comparison ?'
p5433
aS'there is a feeling that our child should fare better than everyone elses child , even your friends child .'
p5434
aS'and it is this constant comparison that creates a pressure on your child .'
p5435
aS'you feel that your child earns a name amongst the family and friends .'
p5436
aS'but is it really his name or your own prestige that you are worried about ?'
p5437
aS'dont you feel that you are the one responsible for making your child a part of an undue competition ?'
p5438
aS'cant we associate him to larger vision and greater meaning of life ?'
p5439
aS'how does he cope with the competition to be same as your neighbors friend circle ?'
p5440
aS'and is this really what you want ?'
p5441
aS'just give s thought on it ?'
p5442
aS'just think , in trying to compete with others , how you have belittle your own childs life .'
p5443
aS'is it fair ?'
p5444
aS'when you talk to children , talk about big dreams , talk of greater heights that can be achieved and you will see a change happening .'
p5445
aS'friends , there is something that always bothers us .'
p5446
aS'we always measure our success in comparison to others .'
p5447
aS'our entire energy is spent in useless competition .'
p5448
aS'there are many points in life where competition is necessary but for self development competition with others might not be a good motivator but competing with oneself each day should be the primary motivation .'
p5449
aS'so start competing with yourself , compete with yourself to do better , to do faster , to do more and to reach new heights .'
p5450
aS'concentrate on compete with yourself to make today better than the past .'
p5451
aS'and you will find that this spirit of competition will give you such a lot of joy and satisfaction that you yourself cant imagine .'
p5452
aS'we remember the athlete sergei bubka very fondly .'
p5453
aS'this athlete broke his own records over 35 times .'
p5454
aS'he would test himself only .'
p5455
aS'every time he would set himself a new challenge and scale new heights .'
p5456
aS'you also follow the same and then see that nothing can stop you from achieving success .'
p5457
aS'dear friends , even students are of different types .'
p5458
aS'some people , irrespective of the exams they may face , they are always happy about it , while some just collapse under the burden of exams .'
p5459
aS'and some keep hiding behind the books in some corner of the house .'
p5460
aS'but despite the type , exams are still exams and it is necessary to pass in them and i also wish that you pass well .'
p5461
aS'but sometimes you must have noticed that we are seeking some causes externally .'
p5462
aS'we seek reasons outside when we are confused about ourselves .'
p5463
aS'we do not have faith in ourselves as if we are giving some exam for the first time .'
p5464
aS'if someone is watching tv and the pitch is loud , we get irritated .'
p5465
aS'if the mother calls for food we are irritated , but at the same time if our friend calls up , we end up chatting for an hour .'
p5466
aS'dont you think that you have some confusion about yourself ?'
p5467
aS'friends it is important for you to identify yourself .'
p5468
aS'just keep doing simple things ; you do need to go far .'
p5469
aS'if you have a sister or your friend has a sister and who is appearing in x or xii standard exam , just observe them .'
p5470
aS'you will see , whether it is x or xii , the girls will definitely help the mothers in the household chores .'
p5471
aS'have you ever thought that how do they manage to do work and yet score well in exams .'
p5472
aS'nowadays the girls are far ahead of boys in examination results .'
p5473
aS'just observe this around you .'
p5474
aS'this will make you realize that issues that bother you are not external .'
p5475
aS'sometimes the reasons are internal .'
p5476
aS'if you are in self doubt then confidence can not help .'
p5477
aS'and that is why i say that as confidence dips , blind faith starts to envelope us and we then start seeking excuses outside .'
p5478
aS'some students are such that we call them aarambhishura .'
p5479
aS'everyday a new thought , everyday a new desire , everyday a new resolution , and then this resolution dies an early death and we are left where we started .'
p5480
aS'i clearly believe that these ever changing desires are called whims by the people .'
p5481
aS'friend , family and relatives make fun of you and hence i would suggest that you have fixed desires .'
p5482
aS'these desires in turn will become resolutions .'
p5483
aS'and resolutions can never be futile .'
p5484
aS'resolutions are accompanied by goals .'
p5485
aS'and when goals and action come together , resolutions are achieved .'
p5486
aS'that is why i say desire + stability = resolution .'
p5487
aS'resolution + action = achievements .'
p5488
aS'i have complete faith that in your life too achievements will be at your feet if only you dedicate yourself .'
p5489
aS'dedicate yourself to your commitment and keep it positive .'
p5490
aS'dont be bothered about defeating others .'
p5491
aS'think of taking yourself further from where you already are .'
p5492
aS'and so test yourself everyday against your own limits , so that however big a challenge in life comes , we will not have any problem .'
p5493
aS'and why should someone else take our exam ?'
p5494
aS'make it a habit to take your exam yourself .'
p5495
aS'each day we will test ourselves .'
p5496
aS'we will see if we have progressed from where we were yesterday .'
p5497
aS'have i reached further than yesterday , have i achieved more than what i achieved yesterday .'
p5498
aS'each day , every moment , keep testing yourself .'
p5499
aS'then such tests will bother you no more in life .'
p5500
aS'every exam will be an opportunity to test and regulate oneself and someone who can regulate himself knows to face challenges boldly .'
p5501
aS'and so who sets himself challenges of life finds these classroom exams very small .'
p5502
aS'sometimes we far exceed our own expectations .'
p5503
aS'just try and remember the good works that you have done .'
p5504
aS'you will be surprised at your own achievement .'
p5505
aS'last year you were sick and yet you got good marks .'
p5506
aS'last year your uncle got married , one full week got wasted but still you managed to score very well .'
p5507
aS'earlier you would sleep for six hours and then last year you decided you will sleep for only five hours and you did it .'
p5508
aS'what advice can modi give you ?'
p5509
aS'you become your own advisor and as lord buddha said uppa deepo bhavahah .'
p5510
aS'it is my belief that one should recognize ones inner light , recognize ones potential .'
p5511
aS'those who set themselves a new limit each time are the ones who scale greater heights .'
p5512
aS'secondly , sometimes we are busy thinking about the distant future .'
p5513
aS'some people live in the past .'
p5514
aS'dont do so during your exams .'
p5515
aS'during examinations it is better to be in the present .'
p5516
aS'does a batsman anytime try and recall when he was out for a duck .'
p5517
aS'or does he think whether we will win this entire series or not .'
p5518
aS'once he enters a match does he think that i will come out only after hitting a century ?'
p5519
aS'not really .'
p5520
aS'in my opinion a good batsman is focused on the ball he is facing .'
p5521
aS'he does not think of the next ball or of the match , or of entire series .'
p5522
aS'you also fix your mind in the present .'
p5523
aS'to win there is only one formula .'
p5524
aS'live in the present , connect with the present .'
p5525
aS'victory will be yours .'
p5526
aS'my dear friends , do you think exams are meant to exhibit your capacity .'
p5527
aS'if this is what you think then you are wrong .'
p5528
aS'who do you have to show your capacity ?'
p5529
aS'who do you need to demonstrate it to ?'
p5530
aS'you should think that these exams are not to demonstrate your capacity but to realize your own potential .'
p5531
aS'if you make this basic mantra your calling , your confidence will get a new boost .'
p5532
aS'once you realize your potential and understand yourself , then you yourself will keep fostering your strengths this strength will translate into a new potential and so dont take exams as a medium of exhibition , take it as an opportunity .'
p5533
aS'this is an opportunity to know oneself , to explore oneself and to be living with oneself .'
p5534
aS'so live on , my friends .'
p5535
aS'friends i have seen that there are many students who become nervous during exams .'
p5536
aS'some go to the extent that look today was my exam and mama did not even wish me .'
p5537
aS'uncle did not wish me and elder brother did not wish me .'
p5538
aS'and probably this issue is debated for an hour or two in the family- who did not wish , who called up to wish , did he send flowers or not .'
p5539
aS'friends rise above all this , do not get involved in all this .'
p5540
aS'think about all this when exams are over .'
p5541
aS'if you have faith in yourself then such things will not arise .'
p5542
aS'i have seen that many students become nervous .'
p5543
aS'i know that some people have the tendency to become nervous .'
p5544
aS'some families have such an environment .'
p5545
aS'i believe that the reason for nervousness is the lack of faith in oneself .'
p5546
aS'how do you get this faith in yourself- if you gain mastery in your subject , you have worked hard and have done multiple revisions .'
p5547
aS'if you have the confidence that you have mastery in some subject , you will see that out of the 5-7 subjects there are only 2-3 topics for which you are never worried .'
p5548
aS'nervousness is about some one or two topics .'
p5549
aS'if you have mastered the subject you will not be nervous .'
p5550
aS'all the hard work that you have done in the past year , all those books that you have studied through the night they will not go waste .'
p5551
aS'it will be there somewhere in your mind .'
p5552
aS'as soon as you sit on your examination desk it will come back to you .'
p5553
aS'you should trust your knowledge , your information .'
p5554
aS'have the faith that all the hard work you have done will certainly bear fruit and secondly be confident about your strengths .'
p5555
aS'you should have the faith that however difficult the exam is , you will crack it successfully .'
p5556
aS'however lengthy the exam is , i will successfully complete it .'
p5557
aS'you should be confident about the timing , be it a two hour or a three hour paper that you will finish it before time .'
p5558
aS'i still remember , maybe you have been told too , our teachers instructed us to do easy questions first and tackle the difficult ones later .'
p5559
aS'i believe someone must have told you the same and i believe that you will follow it .'
p5560
aS'friends , i have received many suggestions and experiences on mygov .'
p5561
aS'in .'
p5562
aS'i will pass them on to the education ministry but i would like to mention a few things here .'
p5563
aS'arnav mohta writes from mumbai , maharashtra that some people make these exams an issue of life and death .'
p5564
aS'as if entire world will finish if one fails these exams .'
p5565
aS'vinita tiwari writes from varanasi that the news of children committing suicide on the declaration of these results saddens her .'
p5566
aS'you too must be hearing such news , but i have got good response from it from another gentleman .'
p5567
aS'mr r kamath has send in some good words .'
p5568
aS'he has asked the students not to become worriers but warriors .'
p5569
aS'really we should not sink in worries but should be a warrior in the battlefield .'
p5570
aS'i believe that we should not drown in our worries ; we should march ahead with the belief that victory will be ours .'
p5571
aS'life is very long .'
p5572
aS'there are ups and downs but one should not perish with them .'
p5573
aS'sometimes , unwanted results are an indication to move forward .'
p5574
aS'they give us the opportunity to find new strength .'
p5575
aS'i have also witnessed another thing .'
p5576
aS'students as soon as they are out of the examination hall , they start estimating how they fared .'
p5577
aS'friends and family too ask the same question .'
p5578
aS'how was todays paper ?'
p5579
aS'whatever is finished is over , please forget about it .'
p5580
aS'i would also request the parents not to ask such questions .'
p5581
aS'as soon as he gets out say , oh the glow on your face says that you have done well .'
p5582
aS'ok good .'
p5583
aS'let us go and prepare for tomorrow .'
p5584
aS'create this mood and friends i also tell you what will be the impact if you calculate and come to know that two questions are wrong and you would lose 6 marks , then tell me will it not impact your performance the other day ?'
p5585
aS'so why waste time on this ?'
p5586
aS'why waste your energy on this ?'
p5587
aS'after all the exams are over , whatever calculations you want to make you are free to do them .'
p5588
aS'how many marks will be scored , that should not be your concern at the time of exams .'
p5589
aS'after the paper finishes concentrate on the next days paper , forget the days paper and you will see your burden lessening by 20-25 % .'
p5590
aS'quite a few thoughts are rising in my mind .'
p5591
aS'i do not know if they will be useful now that the exams are near .'
p5592
aS'but i would like to tell my educator and academician friends that cant we celebrate a week long exam festival twice in a year in each term .'
p5593
aS'it should have a sarcastic poetry session , or a cartoon competition , a debate competition .'
p5594
aS'there should be someone to lecture on the psychological aspects of exams so that this tension around the exams gets eliminated .'
p5595
aS'if exams become a celebration then the students would not need to spend time like the way they are doing today in hearing this out .'
p5596
aS'the students will themselves become confident .'
p5597
aS'also i believe that while teaching the syllabus , a separate lecture should be conducted on topics pertaining to exams .'
p5598
aS'this environment of tension is not conducive .'
p5599
aS'friends , i know that whatever i am telling you , you must have heard a lot more than that .'
p5600
aS'your parents must have lectured you , so must have the teachers .'
p5601
aS'i do not want to confuse you by talking more on this subject .'
p5602
aS'i want to believe that all the sons and daughters of this land who are going to give exams remain happy and joyful and give exams with a free mind .'
p5603
aS'i am talking to make you happy .'
p5604
aS'you will get good results .'
p5605
aS'you will be successful , make exams a celebration , give exams in a joyful mood , enjoy achievement each day , and change the entire atmosphere .'
p5606
aS'parents , teachers , and school all should get together and experience what it is like to challenge the challenges , how wonderful it feels to convert each moment into an opportunity .'
p5607
aS'and remember you can not please everyone in the world .'
p5608
aS'i had a penchant for writing poetry , i had written a poem in gujarati , i dont remember it fully but i had written in it- if successful then you are worth being envious of , if failed then you are nowhere .'
p5609
aS'this is the way of the world .'
p5610
aS'be successful , not to defeat others but to overcome your challenges , be successful for your own pleasure .'
p5611
aS'be successful for bringing pleasure to the lives of those others living in this world .'
p5612
aS'i have this faith that you will succeed with happiness in your heart .'
p5613
aS'you will have great success .'
p5614
aS'and then , whether we could celebrate holi or not , whether we could attend uncles marriage or not , whether i could attend friends birthday party or not , could see the cricket world cup or not- all these things will become immaterial , as for now your dimensions of happiness will be very different .'
p5615
aS'my best wishes to you .'
p5616
aS'nations future is as bright as your own future .'
p5617
aS'indias future will be defined by indias youth ; it will be defined by you .'
p5618
aS'be it the sons or daughters , both have to work in tandem to take the country forward .'
p5619
aS'come make the exam festival into a celebration .'
p5620
aS'my best wishes to you !'

S'honourable chairman sir , we had a detailed discussion on the motion of thanks to the honourable presidents address .'
p5624
aS'i am also here to reply to the honourable presidents address and with a request for this house to pass this motion of thanks to horourable presidents address with a consensus .'
p5625
aS'all the honourable members have communicated their ideas in detail during the discussion .'
p5626
aS'i am grateful to all .'
p5627
aS'this is a fact that this house is a council of states .'
p5628
aS'there are lots of members amongst us who have represented a particular state and during their time of representing that state , public mood was somewhat different than what it is today in the prevailing situation .'
p5629
aS'now the political situations have changed .'
p5630
aS'people have changed their decision .'
p5631
aS'and in that sense , from the perspective of council of states , the representation of the sentiments of the people of those states , representation of the sentiments of the government of those states which the people have elected is a must and this is natural as well .'
p5632
aS'what is more important is the state which we represent rather than the party we are representing and it is our responsibility to represent the state in the position in which it is today .'
p5633
aS'and in that sense , this house will definitely honor the public opinion .'
p5634
aS'the people have given mandate with a great expectation to run the government and although scope for criticism and arguments is always there , it is our collective responsibility to cooperate with each other for the betterment of our country , and i believe that we will not go back in carrying forward this collective responsibility .'
p5635
aS'secondly , threats have neither worked nor will work in democracy .'
p5636
aS'i used to receive many letters for 14 years threatening to put me in jail but here i am standing in front of you today .'
p5637
aS'i am well aware of those games but i do not want to speak on those .'
p5638
aS'it is going to be embedded in the pages of history .'
p5639
aS'and therefore , everybody knows about the character of the people who use threat as a tool .'
p5640
aS'in the same democracy , during the emergency , we are aware of kind of oppression was done .'
p5641
aS'is there any bigger threat than that but the country refused to bow down to those threats .'
p5642
aS'therefore , please do not put words which were never said in someones mouth .'
p5643
aS'the country should run according to the existing laws and within the ambit of existing laws .'
p5644
aS'and lot of members in this house have same objection that we are just promoting the old schemes with new names .'
p5645
aS'i said that in the other assembly and i am repeating it here that this debate that schemes are new or old will drift us further apart .'
p5646
aS'the issue is that problems are long-standing .'
p5647
aS'the real worry is about the problems and finding solutions to the problems .'
p5648
aS'and we dont believe that we are the only experts to resolve these issues .'
p5649
aS'we do not have the thinking that since we are sitting in this position so god is bestowed us with complete knowledge .'
p5650
aS'we too have several drawbacks .'
p5651
aS'but by coming together we can solve the problems .'
p5652
aS'and this is the strength of democracy .'
p5653
aS'nobody can claim to be complete .'
p5654
aS'but if we come together , there is quite a possibility of being complete .'
p5655
aS'but if god is not willing still there can be some shortcomings in overcoming the problems and hence our thought is that we alone can not achieve everything .'
p5656
aS'therefore , may be this assembly has never heard before , and probably it is my true statement that never ever any member of this house would have heard , while having control on treasury bank , they have praised and acknowledged the contribution of others for their role in the development of this country .'
p5657
aS'how can they acknowledge role of others in the development of nation , when they are not willing to give anyone credit in freedom movement .'
p5658
aS'but it was me , who announced from red fort , that this country has move forward due to the contribution extended by all previous governments , prime ministers and state governments .'
p5659
aS'you can refer to my old speech delivered in this house only , wherein i had affirmed these words with great responsibility and pride .'
p5660
aS'we dont believe that the country came into existence on 15 august 1947 .'
p5661
aS'this country is legacy of thousands of years .'
p5662
aS'this country has been in existence owing to it sages , saints , teachers , workers and farmers , and not by governments .'
p5663
aS'governments will keep changing .'
p5664
aS'people like us will come , run the system and the leave .'
p5665
aS'and therefore i request you to please do not force us to live as per your approach or as per the thought process which is within you , which you have lived with .'
p5666
aS'please do not force us to live with the perspective you have lived with which we have never followed and please do not try to test us with the same approach as you used to do .'
p5667
aS'you said that i am just limited to explaining the schemes .'
p5668
aS'i can go further , even up to till the years of 84-86 , but i will not waste that much time .'
p5669
aS'at the time of nda government , there was a scheme named multipurpose national identity project .'
p5670
aS'you brought aadhar uidai it was the same scheme with a new name .'
p5671
aS'during atal iis time , there was sampoorna grameen rojgaar yojna , you brought mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act .'
p5672
aS'during atal jis time , there was freedom of information act , you brought right to information act .'
p5673
aS'during atal jis time , there was antodaya ann yojna , you brought national food security act .'
p5674
aS'during atal jis time , there was sarv shiksha abhiyaan , post 86th constitutional amendment , you brought right of children to free and compulsory education act .'
p5675
aS'during atal jis time , there was swarnim jayanti gram swaraj yojna , you brought national rural livelihoods mission .'
p5676
aS'during atal jis time , there was total sanitation campaign , you brought nirmal bharat abhiyan .'
p5677
aS'during atal jis time , there was insurance regulatory and development authority , you brought pension fund regulatory and development authority act .'
p5678
aS'honorable chairman sir , there were some political talks here as well .'
p5679
aS'i heard talks like who is he , who are they or how many .'
p5680
aS'i would like to draw the attention of this house toward this issue .'
p5681
aS'in political life , taking decisions on mere perception always has chances of errors and you know where you have reached by doing so .'
p5682
aS'and therefore it is very important to understand the ground realities in political life .'
p5683
aS'we can not move on the basis of perception only .'
p5684
aS'i just heard venkaiah ji saying that majority of farmers and dalits etc .'
p5685
aS'are with us .'
p5686
aS'today , on one hand bjp represents ladakh , on the other hand it represents kanyakumari .'
p5687
aS'if it represents kutch on one side , the other side it represents arunachal pradesh .'
p5688
aS'and therefore you can see bjp representing the regions across kutch to kanyakumari .'
p5689
aS'earlier they used to think that we are limited to hindi belt only but today you can see that we have successfully formed government in southern india also .'
p5690
aS'we also know that we have been accused of being party of upper classes only , but after seeing me , you must have to change your thinking .'
p5691
aS'there are few states with highest tribal population , like maharashtra , madhya pradesh , chhattisgarh , jharkhand , rajasthan and gujarat .'
p5692
aS'and the tribal society of these states have voted for bhartiya janata party .'
p5693
aS'you also know that goa where decisive voters are from christian society bjp is ruling there with full majority .'
p5694
aS'nagaland where maximum voters belong to christian society is having bjp government .'
p5695
aS'jammu & kashmir where decisive voters are muslims is having bjp government .'
p5696
aS'punjab , with majority of sikh community as decision makers also has our government from so many years .'
p5697
aS'so these are the regions being ruled by bjp and therefore , ground reality must be considered that now bjp has emerged as a party , which is widely acceptable across different regions .'
p5698
aS'and therefore the perception based on which you are bringing your point forward is the thing of the past .'
p5699
aS'we are well aware of the era when the ancestors of our sitaram ji used to tell people that that vehicle which is running on your blood and not running on petrol .'
p5700
aS'we have heard such dialogues long ago .'
p5701
aS'so do we need to pay attention to these kinds of dialogues in todays world ?'
p5702
aS'time has changed and therefore i wanted to ask this .'
p5703
aS'i am thankful to sharad ji that he has delivered what i have been thinking .'
p5704
aS'and please spare some time to read my book namely samajik samrasta .'
p5705
aS'i have explained your emotions in detail , and you will be quite happy to read it .'
p5706
aS'i am not saying that you will also enjoy the same happiness .'
p5707
aS'i totally acknowledge what sharad ji said .'
p5708
aS'is the sanitation campaign is a program for corporate sector or for rich people only ?'
p5709
aS'the poor society of india , living in huts , is craving for quality of life .'
p5710
aS'cant we provide them hygienic atmosphere ?'
p5711
aS'and therefore i think of them when i run such campaigns .'
p5712
aS'i talk about honour of our mothers and sisters .'
p5713
aS'due to jan dhan yojana , poor people are able to open their bank accounts .'
p5714
aS'is this a corporate program ?'
p5715
aS'this program is not associated with rich people or corporate world .'
p5716
aS'the issue of toilets in schools , which schools are covered under this programme ?'
p5717
aS'the schools where poor children are studying , for example , a drivers son goes to this type of school .'
p5718
aS'there are no toilets .'
p5719
aS'i am working hard to resolve this issue .'
p5720
aS'is this a program for rich people or corporate world ?'
p5721
aS'i talk about soil health card .'
p5722
aS'who are covered under it ?'
p5723
aS'poor farmers having small piece of land .'
p5724
aS'i talk about per dropmore crop .'
p5725
aS'why ?'
p5726
aS'since he is a small farmer , and is having small piece of land .'
p5727
aS'how can he produce more crops ?'
p5728
aS'i am working hard in this direction .'
p5729
aS'is this a program for corporate world ?'
p5730
aS'will rich people make money from it ?'
p5731
aS'we auction coal blocks to earn money .'
p5732
aS'the eastern belt of india is full of natural resources .'
p5733
aS'be it bihar , jharkhand , west bengal , assam , poorvanchal - these states are full of natural resources , take orissa despite having so much natural resources is not able to come out of poverty .'
p5734
aS'shouldnt we try to improve take them out of poverty ?'
p5735
aS'is the western part is the only part entitled for development ?'
p5736
aS'i am pained that country can not move further until balanced development is done in all regions .'
p5737
aS'so , the money generated from coal auction , will be used in the upliftment of the states , who are in possession of coal .'
p5738
aS'this will give the poor a chance to fight against poverty and will help the states to develop .'
p5739
aS'is this happening for the rich ?'
p5740
aS'is this taking place for the corporate world ?'
p5741
aS'clean ganga : 40 percent of the countrys population is directly or indirectly financially connected with the river ganga .'
p5742
aS'for some , cleaning ganga , would be a matter of devotion .'
p5743
aS'for some , it would be an environmental issue , but cleaning ganga , is also a massive economic programme , on the whole .'
p5744
aS'it has the strength to awaken the country financially .'
p5745
aS'this can help the poor to bring a change in their lives financially .'
p5746
aS'this government is only determined to serve the dejected poor class of the society .'
p5747
aS'skill india : anand ji was sharing the facts , i dont intend to share the same , and various committees were formed , various missions were set , many came and many left , i dont want to talk about this , but all the successful countries , too , are focussing and working towards the goal of skill development .'
p5748
aS'it is our responsibility that we use our demographic dividend in the most appropriate manner .'
p5749
aS'if we have the demographic dividend , we have the hands , but we also need skills along with the hands .'
p5750
aS'having mere hands will not serve the purpose , we need hands with proper skills .'
p5751
aS'i believe , if the youths of our country have skills , it can act as a strengthening catalyst for reaching new heights in the country .'
p5752
aS'therefore , we are focussing on the poor children , who have left their studies after 5th or 3rd grade , should be provided with skill development programme .'
p5753
aS'housing for all : who are these people , who do not have houses to live in ?'
p5754
aS'are they corporates ?'
p5755
aS'these people are none other than , the poor citizens of our country .'
p5756
aS'we are trying to provide them houses , by building 3 crore houses in the villages and 2 crore houses in the cities , by the year 2022 , when we will celebrate the pure indian independence .'
p5757
aS'we will always move forward to make to dream come true .'
p5758
aS'there is no requirement of any political agenda for making this dream true , we will also ask the congress rulers to support us in this venture and provide houses to the poor .'
p5759
aS'this venture is not a part of government programme , but this is a programme for the poor citizens of our country .'
p5760
aS'therefore , we are focussing on this problem .'
p5761
aS'i am sure , you all will support us , in moving forward with the goal of upliftment of the poor .'
p5762
aS'we all can see that , intelligent people do different analysis , but in our entire budget , 42 percent devolution is for the states that comprise indian economy , we need to think about them .'
p5763
aS'when we speak of the development of nation , it is high time to combine the states and nations riches and its time to see the policies in a perspective .'
p5764
aS'you are the representatives of the state .'
p5765
aS'this is the council of states , where huge devolution has been provided .'
p5766
aS'once the money is utilised in the infrastructure and development of the state , it will lead to economy generation .'
p5767
aS'i would like to request all the respected representatives of the states , to utilise any huge amount of money , in the right direction of development of the state , which will help the state to develop on the whole and bring an end to all the problems .'
p5768
aS'we have come up with a new mudra ( micro units development and refinancing agency ) scheme in our current budget .'
p5769
aS'we want to know that who runs the economy in our country in reality ?'
p5770
aS'we have not researched on this issue .'
p5771
aS'the common men of this country are the one who provide jobs , perform jobs , as well as run our countrys economy .'
p5772
aS'we have the auto-drivers , auto rickshaw repairer , auto rickshaw owner , scooter repairer , cycle repairer , boot polisher , fruits seller , bread seller and many more .'
p5773
aS'these are all common men of our country , who provide 5.'
p5774
aS'5 crore jobs to the poor and 11-12 crore jobs on the whole .'
p5775
aS'this is not a small amount .'
p5776
aS'they have the capability to provide jobs to people .'
p5777
aS'but , it is highly disappointing to see that there is no organization from where these sectors can take funds if required .'
p5778
aS'they borrow money from the money lenders on 120 % interest and spend half of their lives in paying the interest .'
p5779
aS'for the first time , our government has formulated mudra scheme , wherein these sectors will be benefited with funds with institutional arrangements and they will be able to develop themselves financially .'
p5780
aS'i believe , other factors related to financial development will also be affected by this new scheme and will lead the nation to new heights .'
p5781
aS'who are these people ?'
p5782
aS'about 54 percent of the population are conducting small scale business in the rural sectors .'
p5783
aS'46 percent of the population are running their business in the cities .'
p5784
aS'more than 60 percent of those who are involved in these businesses , are scheduled caste or schedules tribe or obc .'
p5785
aS'this implies that if we try to focus on this backward sector of the society , i believe that they can move ahead in their development at a very high pace .'
p5786
aS'we are trying to provide jobs to these backward sector of the society .'
p5787
aS'till now , the institutional finance , which have been provided to them.'
p5788
ag1044
aS'respected chairman sir , this assembly comprises of all the senior citizens .'
p5789
aS'these citizens are much more experienced , hard-working and have contributed a lot towards the development of our nation .'
p5790
aS'i am quite new in this assembly , thereby requesting you to assist me in this situation .'
p5791
aS'respected chairman sir , out of 125 crore of population , 29 crore citizens have life insurance policy .'
p5792
aS'only 10 crore citizens have accidental death cover insurance .'
p5793
aS'only 6 crore citizens have the organized pension scheme cover .'
p5794
aS'other than this , under the bpl category , a widow or any other senior citizen has the pension scheme ranging from 300 inr to 1500 inr .'
p5795
aS'this is a very common scheme in our wide nation .'
p5796
aS'we are trying ways to find a solution to a very big problem in our country .'
p5797
aS'and , i believe we are trying to reach all the sections of our society with the help of prime minister safety insurance scheme , prime minister life of light scheme and atal pension scheme .'
p5798
aS'we are planning to simplify these schemes .'
p5799
aS'with one rupee every month and for citizens under the age group of 18 to 70 years , we can generate accidental death cover insurance of 2 lakh rupees .'
p5800
aS'i believe , considering the present scenario of our nation , we are worried about poor citizens of our country .'
p5801
aS'under prime minister life of light scheme , we can generate 330 rupees , which is one rupee per day , and citizens under the age group of 18 to 50 years , can use the benefits of this insurance without any medical tests .'
p5802
aS'not only this , rs .'
p5803
aS'2 lakh risk coverage will be provided to the family , in case of death under normal circumstances as well .'
p5804
aS'atal pension scheme , under this pension scheme , after 60 years , any citizen who requires a pension of one , two , three , five thousand or any other amount , this pension plan will work as per the pension amount required .'
p5805
aS'if a 20 year old opts for this scheme and requires a pension amount of rs .'
p5806
aS'5000 after 60 years , then he is required to contribute rs .'
p5807
aS'248 per year till the age of 60 , and he can get the pension of rs .'
p5808
aS'5000 per month , throughout his life .'
p5809
aS'in case of death , his wife will be benefited with the pension amount .'
p5810
aS'in case of death of both mother and father , their children will be refunded the deposited amount of rs .'
p5811
aS'8.'
p5812
aS'5 lakh .'
p5813
aS'our nations requirement of social security and its awareness will be fulfilled through this scheme .'
p5814
aS'we have tried out best to uplift our society with the safety and satisfaction among the senior citizens in their last stages of life .'
p5815
aS'our countrys farmers believe i slog day and night , will get old and then will be eventually separated by our children .'
p5816
aS'if i had pension .'
p5817
ag1044
ag1044
aS'so , with the help of this scheme , even the farmers will be benefited , housewives .'
p5818
aS'so , if children leave them in their old age , or if they dont have children , they can still continue to avail the benefits of this pension scheme .'
p5819
aS'we have also come up with a new sovereign gold bond scheme .'
p5820
aS'even after independence , our golds hallmark is run through some or the other foreign hallmark .'
p5821
aS'this is very disappointing that our country doesnt have its owngold hallmark .'
p5822
aS'so , with this sovereign gold bond , we will have our own gold coins , biscuits , ashok chakra emblem and we can reach everywhere around the world .'
p5823
aS'there are a few things , which are directly connected to our dignity and self-respect , which will act as a powerful weapon for our country .'
p5824
aS'when we speak of sovereign gold bank and for example , we speak of 20 thousand tonnes of gold , this might lead anand sharma to stand up and narrate the quantity of gold mentioned by me .'
p5825
aS'to this , i would say , this is just a way to speak .'
p5826
aS'we are unable to use the available gold in our country , gold monetization ; it is merely present as a dead money in our country .'
p5827
aS'it will be a great driving force to uplift the nations economy with its circulation .'
p5828
aS'so , we are eliminating the policy of half kilo gold from our country .'
p5829
aS'citizens can keep any amount of gold , borrow money and go ahead in their lives .'
p5830
aS'i believe , with this venture , a huge amount of gold in the form of dead money will provide an enormous boost to our nation .'
p5831
aS'in the same manner , we want to proceed with the sovereign gold bond .'
p5832
aS'it is not mandatory to buy gold in the form of metal , but you can also buy gold in the form of paper .'
p5833
aS'eventually , you will be refunded the amount according the present gold rate , once you return the paper gold .'
p5834
aS'this will also support in the import-export balance in our nation .'
p5835
aS'i believe our country will be immensely benefited with this scheme .'
p5836
aS'i believe , a country requires good ideas and customs for positive development .'
p5837
aS'we can not expect a positive outcome , with just good ideas or just good customs .'
p5838
aS'we need a combination of both ideas and customs , which will lead the country to the path of upliftment .'
p5839
aS'therefore , we are striving to adopt and develop a work culture , which will help us in achieving our goals .'
p5840
aS'shri .'
p5841
aS'ghulam nabi ji and shri anand ji have raised the issues of transfers of officers , which is very disappointing .'
p5842
aS'i am observing that people are so distressed , just like a gram seed dries off in water .'
p5843
aS'they are in great pain , as they have been transferred .'
p5844
aS'i would like to say that , we should look into our own reflection in mirrors , before giving such sermons .'
p5845
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004 .'
p5846
aS'you had dismissed the cabinet secretary , as soon as the government was formed .'
p5847
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004 .'
p5848
aS'you had appointed foreign secretary without considering the convention of seniority .'
p5849
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004 .'
p5850
aS'you had dismissed the home secretary straightaway .'
p5851
aS'your government was formed in the year 2004 .'
p5852
aS'you had even dismissed the efficient defence secretary in one moment .'
p5853
aS'not only this , you had insulted the governors , kept them in darkness and dismissed them .'
p5854
aS'we havent done anything like this .'
p5855
aS'i may address to ghulam nabi ji , an ex- health minister , wherein a secretary from your department had received a nobel prize from un for polio .'
p5856
aS'you had dismissed him , while he was receiving the award from un .'
p5857
aS'so , we need to decide , what all can be revealed here in the assembly .'
p5858
aS'even though i am new here , i have a huge treasure of information with me .'
p5859
aS'and therefore , we have decided and we are keenly determined to move in the direction of good governance .'
p5860
aS'one more fact has come up into consideration that we have received some from our supporters , some from those who think positive of us and some from those who have special love for us .'
p5861
aS'and , i have received a lot of love from many of who have bestowed special love .'
p5862
aS'we can see nothing on the ground .'
p5863
aS'i really admire modi jis statements , his way of thinking , but i am unable to see any result on the grounds .'
p5864
aS'i would like to say to my supporters that you have been in government for ages and are intoxicated with power .'
p5865
aS'i pray to god to save all of us from that intoxication of power .'
p5866
aS'as , when we are addicted to power , the addiction becomes quite high , so when the head is quite high above the ground , we are unable to look down and see the ground level .'
p5867
aS'i believe , the more you look down , the more you connect with people , so i would like the people here who have asked about ground to understand how the work is done .'
p5868
aS'railways and highways , both are run by the government .'
p5869
aS'however , there has , always been a clash between the two , as the railways would never allow more than 350 projects of highways and , the latter would never give permissions to railways for more projects .'
p5870
aS'some need to build a railway line across the road line and some need to build an over bridge across the railway line .'
p5871
aS'there were 350 projects , we came and we noticed and asked both the departments to sit across the table and clear all the misunderstandings and got a mou signed between the two , and today i am happy to announce that we have introduced an online portal for the same .'
p5872
aS'online clearances are now being provided .'
p5873
aS'the projects , which were stuck in these departments for the past 350 years , stand all clear now .'
p5874
aS'now , if any new project is undertaken , it has been decided to clear the same within 60 days .'
p5875
aS'at present , we have just 22 projects in hand , which are under process .'
p5876
aS'this is a pure example of good governance and this is how a work is done .'
p5877
aS'let me give you the details of the work done on the grounds .'
p5878
aS'i will speak of the upa first , wherein 7.'
p5879
aS'4 km per day of highway were awarded , but only 5.'
p5880
aS'2 km per day used to be achieved .'
p5881
aS'anand ji , let me give you the accounts of work done within 9 months now .'
p5882
aS'we award the work of 18 km per day , and we have received the reports that we achieve 10.'
p5883
aS'1 km per day .'
p5884
aS'its double and this is how a work is done , and government can run on the ground level .'
p5885
aS'railway : 2013-14-new line- upa- 390 km .'
p5886
aS'new line- 9 months- nda 2410 km .'
p5887
aS'2013-14 - gauge conversion - 585 km .'
p5888
aS'our 9 months - 700 km .'
p5889
aS'upa - doubling - 675 km .'
p5890
aS'our - 810 km .'
p5891
aS'i am trying to convey that we are connected to the grounds of our country , and i am sure you will be able to see the results on the ground through our work .'
p5892
aS'adarsh gram scheme : i would like to convey my special gratitude and appreciate the work of few respected members of the parliament .'
p5893
aS'about 600 members have joined hands and supported in this work with all their hearts .'
p5894
aS'i have been informed , i love to speak about people in this way , especially , if i have to speak of our respected motilal ji veera , he has done a tremendous work in a village called mohali , chhatisgarh .'
p5895
aS'he took initiatives to open jan dhan accounts for all the ration card holders , connected the people with aadhaar cards , built committees for safeguarding government distribution , so that the poor can be benefited through pds system .'
p5896
aS'respected motilal ji has worked on these important grounds .'
p5897
aS'so , if the members of the parliament take such initiatives and interests , it can help the villages to transform with a new developed shape .'
p5898
aS'i have all the information about the members .'
p5899
aS'i would like to mention the name of our member , kamakhya prasad from jorhat , who has come up with perfect safety schemes for icds and mid-day meals , so that the children can get proper meals .'
p5900
aS'our own aviation minister , shri ashok ji , who has adopted a village in andhra pradesh , took a pledge and surrendered himself to eliminate the prevailing alcohol intake in the village .'
p5901
aS'the village members were used to drinking alcohol and have the licence for alcohol shops .'
p5902
aS'if we have the support of all the members , we have move forward in the path of good governance and achieve our goals .'
p5903
aS'you must be aware of the labour practices , wherein our labourers who had slogged day and night , and should be allotted the amount of rs .'
p5904
aS'27,000 crores , which is not a small amount , but they are unable to receive the amount .'
p5905
aS'why ?'
p5906
aS'as some labourers are paid just rs .'
p5907
aS'50 , rs .'
p5908
aS'100 or rs .'
p5909
aS'200 , and they can not stick to just one place for work .'
p5910
aS'if he relocates to some other workplace , he has to bear extra fare for reaching the old workplace for receiving the payment of rs .'
p5911
aS'50 or rs 100 .'
p5912
aS'there are no accounts of the labourers , who died for any reason .'
p5913
aS'there is no proper account of their payments and our government treasury has rs .'
p5914
aS'27,000 crores , which belongs to the labourers .'
p5915
aS'we have tried to formulate the uan ( universal account number ) policy .'
p5916
aS'with the help of this uan policy , labourers will be receiving their payments in their accounts , irrespective of their location .'
p5917
aS'with this , the labourers will be able to receive their pending amount of payment , from the treasury of rs .'
p5918
aS'27,000 crore , which is lying with the government .'
p5919
aS'this money belongs to the poor and is it their rightful money .'
p5920
aS'the government doesnt want to use this money for any other cause , we want to pay the money back to the labourers .'
p5921
aS'i believe , this is a result of good governance and will have a positive impact in the development of our nation .'
p5922
aS'if we speak of prime minister peoples money , i dont want to take much of your time for discussing the same .'
p5923
aS'we have been discussing mnrega repeatedly .'
p5924
aS'what i spoke in the last assembly , i would not be repeating the same here , as that has been registered appropriately and has been addressed .'
p5925
aS'now , i would like to talk about aadhaar cards and mnrega .'
p5926
aS'i dont want to criticize and make comparison between them .'
p5927
aS'but , i have the strength and culture to say that , all our governments have contributed to the development of our nation .'
p5928
aS'our country must have faced various obstacles in reaching what we are today , nonetheless , huge contributions have been done .'
p5929
aS'let us speak of the working of aadhaar cards : in 45 months under upa , which is almost 3.'
p5930
aS'5 years , 7 crore aadhaar settlements took place .'
p5931
aS'in 9 months under nda , 17 crore settlements took place .'
p5932
aS'so , we can see the difference between 45 months and 9 months .'
p5933
aS'you have to compare between 45 months and 9 months .'
p5934
aS'in 45 months of upa government , 5,000 aadhar cards were linked with mnrega .'
p5935
aS'and at the time nda government , 8 lac aadhar cards have been linked with this scheme .'
p5936
aS'now compare 5000 in 45 months versus 8 lakhs in just 9 months ?'
p5937
aS'at the time of upa , 1.'
p5938
aS'7 crore aadhar cards were linked with job cards .'
p5939
aS'we have added 5 crore people in 9 months .'
p5940
aS'compare 1.'
p5941
aS'7 crores versus 5 crores ?'
p5942
aS'and therefore , i said that both policy and practices needs to be developed .'
p5943
aS'we talk about mnrega and job guarantee for 100 days for poor people .'
p5944
aS'during 2013-14 , average days of employment under this scheme were 42.'
p5945
aS'5 days only , which is well short of 50 % .'
p5946
aS'and how many persons got jobs for 100 days during 2013-14 ?'
p5947
aS'only 6.'
p5948
aS'35 % .'
p5949
aS'and when this issue was brought to the notice of honorable supreme court , it was admitted by upa government , that they have no audit report for the expenses incurred , amounting to rs .'
p5950
aS'1 lakh crore in the last five years in mnrega .'
p5951
aS'this affidavit has been filed by you in supreme court .'
p5952
aS'we talk a lot about plans , discussions related to it , credit , rules and strict laws .'
p5953
aS'nation wants us to do the best , for the benefit of poor people and try to improve the life style of a common man .'
p5954
aS'and you will see that in 9 months that the government is working in the same direction .'
p5955
aS'respected mayawati ji has discussed about bundelkhand .'
p5956
aS'bundelkhand is divided into two states madhya pradesh & uttar pradesh .'
p5957
aS'an amount of rs .'
p5958
aS'3,760 crore was disbursed for six districts of madhya pradesh .'
p5959
aS'at the same time , an amount of rs .'
p5960
aS'3506 crore was disbursed for seven districts of uttar pradesh .'
p5961
aS'madhya pradesh spent 96 % amount out of it and you can see the results .'
p5962
aS'bundelkhand connected to madhya pradesh has shown a drastic improvement in wheat yield from 1,629 kilogram per hectare to 2,323 kilogram per hectare .'
p5963
aS'the amount given has been used for irrigation of 1,42,000 hectare land .'
p5964
aS'milk production has improved from 9 lakh ton to 12 lakh ton .'
p5965
aS'around 561 milk cooperative societies have been initiated .'
p5966
aS'drinking water consumption has improved from 40 litres per person to 55 litres .'
p5967
aS'since you belong to uttar pradesh , i would not like to share the progress report for the bundelkhand connected to uttar pradesh .'
p5968
aS'maybe your concern is quite genuine , but i have shared the facts about other part connected to madhya pradesh .'
p5969
aS'we had a discussion on bengal also .'
p5970
aS'there are some people who are trying to run this country with imported ideology .'
p5971
aS'they ruled the bengal for 30 years .'
p5972
aS'but derek , i wont blame you for the current situation .'
p5973
aS'you can do what you want but the cr should remain ok .'
p5974
aS'in the past 30 years , the image of west bengal , which once was known as capital of industrial activity in india , and kolkata , which was once known as industrial capital has been completely destroyed .'
p5975
aS'west bengal was one of the industrial development leaders for agricultural growth .'
p5976
aS'in last 30 years , agricultural growth is reduced to minus figures .'
p5977
aS'west bengals share in industrial development is reduced to 4 % from 10 % .'
p5978
aS'during 1976-77 , 7.'
p5979
aS'6 % percent of total factories were running in bengal which was reduced to 4 % in 2008-09 .'
p5980
aS'during 1966-76 , industrial growth was 17.'
p5981
aS'3 % which was reduced to 7.'
p5982
aS'8 % during 2001-07 .'
p5983
aS'during 2007 national sample survey , it was observed that bengal is the most affected state suffering from starvation .'
p5984
aS'only 60 % schools have functional toilets for girl compared to national average of 75 % .'
p5985
aS'yesterday , sitaram ji was discussing about closure of nokia factory in chennai .'
p5986
aS'the nation wants us to create jobs and we have to try our best in this direction .'
p5987
aS'to complete this task , we have to promote make in india campaign .'
p5988
aS'speed of infrastructure will decide job opportunities , and to increase the job opportunities , we should focus on infrastructure .'
p5989
aS'yesterday , shri sitarajm ji had shown concern for closure of nokia factory in chennai and for 25000 employees who lost their job .'
p5990
aS'i would like to state that this factory was not closed down due to our governments policy .'
p5991
aS'it has been closed due to certain steps taken by the previous government .'
p5992
aS'i acknowledge your concern .'
p5993
aS'yes , 25000 employees have lost their job .'
p5994
aS'but i would like to assure you , that we have taken necessary steps .'
p5995
aS'and we hope that nokia will resume shortly and jobs will be created .'
p5996
aS'so we are already working in this direction .'
p5997
aS'the president , in his address has talked about digital india .'
p5998
aS'honorable chairman sir , it is true that once there was a global theory of haves and have nots .'
p5999
aS'i believe that in the coming days , digital divide could be one of the reasons for poverty and backwardness .'
p6000
aS'therefore , nation must not face the situation of digital divide .'
p6001
aS'and to stop the digital divide , we need to associate even the poorest of the poor with digital technology .'
p6002
aS'india is having more than 90 crore mobile users and is likely to touch the 100 crore mark very soon .'
p6003
aS'we wish to introduce mobile governance .'
p6004
aS'how can the poorest of the poor become a part of this system ?'
p6005
aS'and when we talk of digital india , we should aim to take the bpos from centers like hyderabad , mumbai , bangalore , chennai and ahmedabad to the north east where the youth is well versed with the english language and can speak it fluently .'
p6006
aS'we are trying our best to proceed in that direction to arrange for a regular means of income for the youth .'
p6007
aS'everyone has also expressed their concerns over the issue of black money .'
p6008
aS'this is the topic where nobody ever has expressed their thoughts before .'
p6009
aS'only we kept talking about it .'
p6010
aS'and we had a lot of figures at that time .'
p6011
aS'i believe that when supreme court had ordered to form sit , back in 2011 , our dream of extracting all the money stashed away in foreign banks would have been possible .'
p6012
aS'however , sit was not formed as the time as there were vested interests .'
p6013
aS'if sit was formed at the time , and all the procedures had started , it wouldnt have been as difficult and time consuming to bring back the money .'
p6014
aS'and i believe that even now all money stashed abroad must be brought back to the country .'
p6015
aS'we are doing whatever legally required to address this issue .'
p6016
aS'also , whether it is about the g-20 summit , or about the dialogue with switzerland or talking to america about mou , we are on signing a mou to exchange information with the world .'
p6017
aS'one after other new countries are joining this movement because without proper information we wont be able to fight this battle .'
p6018
aS'on the other hand , indian citizens will have to declare information about any property or wealth that they have stashed away on foreign shores , as per the new laws .'
p6019
aS'as a result of this , things will come into light and it is in this manner that we plan for bringing back the black money .'
p6020
aS'we will complete this procedure and we must do this !'
p6021
aS'all the respected members present here have expressed their concerns over land acquisition .'
p6022
aS'this is a gathering of seniors and i assure all of you that under this scheme , i have ensured from day 1 that if there is anything against the farmers of the country , we are ready to correct it .'
p6023
aS'but what has been promulgated has its flaws because we were a participant in that .'
p6024
aS'we wont deny that we had not done this .'
p6025
aS'if we had done something good then dont give credit to us but there has been a wrongdoing , then we too are responsible for it .'
p6026
aS'but now we should come out of it - for the betterment and development of the country .'
p6027
aS'and i dont want to make into an ego issue or play politics here .'
p6028
aS'we will need land for irrigation in order to ensure that the farmers have enough water for their crops and thus theprime ministers krishi sinchai yojana will be a success .'
p6029
aS'we will need land to make roads in villages and also to make houses for the poor under the rural housing scheme .'
p6030
aS'and there is no provision in our current laws .'
p6031
aS'hence i request you not to spread rumors that there is a deduction in compensation .'
p6032
aS'no one has ever tweaked the rules of compensation before .'
p6033
aS'as decided the compensation will remain the same and there wont be any decrease in that .'
p6034
aS'but the law was made in 2013 .'
p6035
aS'what happened ?'
p6036
aS'it was implemented in january , 2014 .'
p6037
aS'the rule was implemented in haryana in the month of july despite the fact that congress was the ruling party there .'
p6038
aS'they refused to give the compensation as decided by the rules made under the law .'
p6039
aS'not just that , we made these laws in maharashtra where congress was the ruling party .'
p6040
aS'this means that states are finding it difficult to function as per these laws .'
p6041
ag1044
ag1044
aS'i am not talking about congress or bjp here .'
p6042
ag1044
ag1044
aS'but they are definitely facing problems and finding it difficult .'
p6043
aS'and all the states have expressed their despair , and as this is the council of states , it is our duty to protect all states .'
p6044
aS'and it is our first responsibility of this council to act upon the concern that the states have expressed and ensure that law does not prove to be a burden on the states and rework it according to the hopes and aspirations of the respective states .'
p6045
aS'the law will stay , we have to remove the flaws .'
p6046
aS'if there is any flaw in that , then we will have to remove it as well .'
p6047
aS'and i invite you all to come and help us in our quest of evolution tour to develop the country .'
p6048
aS'and no matter how intelligent we are , we should consider the fact that the laws that have helped the country develop and also served the farmers of the country from 1894 to 2014 , a total of 120 years , would not have lost its efficiency overnight .'
p6049
aS'we have to think about the farmers of our country and strive to protect them but we have to do it together and this is my insistence .'
p6050
aS'theres another misconception that is being spread , perhaps not intentionally but due to wrong information .'
p6051
aS'i request you to not do this .'
p6052
aS'the government has no intention to deduct anything from the 67 % promised coverage for the poor .'
p6053
aS'some are spreading rumors about the decrease of coverage from 67 % to 40 % , i believe that this will not happen and i request you to refrain from spreading such rumors and trouble us .'
p6054
aS'this devolution that has happened .'
p6055
ag1044
ag1044
aS'the work assigned to them was the restructuring of food corporation of india .'
p6056
aS'see there are 50 different types of reports that comes to the government .'
p6057
aS'you also must have submitted reports , but it is not on the basis of reports , the government only conveys its decision .'
p6058
aS'i only inform you about the governments decision .'
p6059
aS'and i believe you are the connected with governments decisions .'
p6060
aS'another thing is that due to this 42 % devolution , the following changes will be seen .'
p6061
ag1044
ag1044
aS'derek ji , west bengal will get rs .'
p6062
aS'22,000 crore extra , andhra pradesh will get rs .'
p6063
aS'15,000 crore extra , orissa will get rs .'
p6064
aS'8,000 crore extra .'
p6065
aS'likewise , i can tell all the extra money that every state will be getting but for now , i have brought the list of only 3 states .'
p6066
aS'the budget features a comprehensive list comprising of telangana as well .'
p6067
aS'everyone is getting 42 percent .'
p6068
aS'now the biggest thing about the rise of royalty on minerals that has been increased by 1.'
p6069
aS'5 per cent which is going to benefit mostly the eastern regions of the country .'
p6070
aS'not only that , the money raised by the coal auctions will also be given to the states .'
p6071
aS'till date , 19 coal mines have been auctioned and more than rs 1 lakh crore has been generated from the same .'
p6072
aS'this money will also be given to these states .'
p6073
aS'according to the calculation , of the total amount received , the bulk 62 % will be with the states and only 38 % will be with the center .'
p6074
aS'this is a proper procedure that is being implemented and hence some people advice that it needs to be verified .'
p6075
aS'not only that , foreign policies were also discussed .'
p6076
aS'in the current scenario , it is safe to assume that as opposed to earlier , the world is divided into different parts now .'
p6077
aS'the dynamics of the camps of this world has changed over the years .'
p6078
aS'to protect the supreme interest of india is the centre point of our foreign policy .'
p6079
aS'i had said this before the elections , post it and even after becoming the prime minister of the country that the world needs to realise the greatness of india .'
p6080
aS'as far as the foreign policy is concerned , our stance would be to build relationships with the world .'
p6081
aS'we want to build deeper bonds with the neighbouring nations .'
p6082
aS'however , we will be at par with the rest of the nations and never be subdued in front of them in order to build good relationships .'
p6083
aS'however , we will also not be dominant .'
p6084
aS'we just want to be at par with the other nations and develop healthy and fruitful relationships with all of them .'
p6085

p6723
aa(lp6724
S'greetings to all my dear farmer brothers and sisters !'
p6725
aS'today , i feel so fortunate to avail this opportunity to speak with my farmer brothers and sisters from different corners of the country .'
p6726
aS'when i speak to farmers , i speak to the village and its residents , and also to the farm labourers .'
p6727
aS'i am also speaking to the mothers and sisters who work on the farm fields .'
p6728
aS'and in this context probably this feeling is a little different from all the interactions i had through mann ki baat .'
p6729
aS'when i decided to speak about farmers in mann ki baat , i never expected that the farmers from far off villages across the country would be willing to ask numerous questions and would provide such information .'
p6730
aS'i was taken aback to receive your numerous letters and questions in such huge numbers .'
p6731
aS'i can say that you all are very aware and active and you all probably yearn that somebody listens to you .'
p6732
aS'first of all i would like to express my heartfelt greetings to you all .'
p6733
aS'i have read your letters and understood the agony and struggle in your lives .'
p6734
aS'despite bearing so much misery , i can not imagine what all you have gone through in your lives .'
p6735
aS'you all have taken me aback but i take this mann ki baat to be an opportunity for education and experience .'
p6736
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters , i would like to assure you , that all your questions and queries from different aspects that you brought to my notice would be addressed by me and i will bring consciousness and sensitivity on those subjects in my government and not let my village , my poor people , my farmer brothers will not be forced to live in this pathetic condition .'
p6737
aS'i am shocked , farmers have written letters related to farming but they have also brought some other issues , like the problems they face with the village mafias and gangs .'
p6738
aS'i can understand the problems related to natural calamities , but they are also facing the issues with small time businessmen .'
p6739
aS'some farmers have to drink contaminated water in their villages , some have raised concerns on the facilities to provide shelter to their cattle , and some have also mentioned that there is no facility to dispose off the dead animals , which leads to various diseases among the villagers .'
p6740
aS'this suggests that today through mann ki baat , the governing bodies are getting a unique chance to understand numerous problems of the farmers .'
p6741
aS'we can attain our rights to govern the country only when we can understand and provide solution to all these small but important issues .'
p6742
aS'i feel so embarrassed when i read your letters and think what we have done so far .'
p6743
aS'i have no answer to this question .'
p6744
aS'what have we done ?'
p6745
aS'yes , you words have touched my heart .'
p6746
aS'i will try my best to bring a change and would awaken the sleeping government to run in the most appropriate manner .'
p6747
aS'this will be my primary focus and that is a promise from my side .'
p6748
aS'i am aware that you had to face great difficulties last year due to scarcity of rain .'
p6749
aS'this year , due to the unseasonal rain and hail-storm , all the states above maharashtra had to bear a lot of difficulties .'
p6750
aS'farmers , across all the corners of the country had to face great difficulties .'
p6751
aS'a poor farmer who leads his life through slogging in the fields has no other source of living or income .'
p6752
aS'i am with you in this difficult time of your life .'
p6753
aS'our government is also taking stock of the situation minutely , on various issues of the farmer and is in touch with different departments of the state .'
p6754
aS'the ministers are also out in the field visiting various states and collecting reviews and analysing its situation .'
p6755
aS'i have also asked the state governments to work closely along with the central government and strive to help as much as possible to our farmer brothers and sisters in this situation .'
p6756
aS'i can assure you that the government will take proper steps and solve your problems promptly and help you in this difficult time .'
p6757
aS'we will do whatever is possible to help you and do our best to fulfil those .'
p6758
aS'villagers and farmers have raised various issues .'
p6759
aS'irrigation problem is one of the most important issues .'
p6760
aS'farmers are also angry due to the unavailability of roads in villages .'
p6761
aS'they are also unhappy about the increasing price of fertilizers .'
p6762
aS'there is no electricity .'
p6763
aS'they are also unhappy about the fact that they are unable to educate their children , which in their wish is also a complaint .'
p6764
aS'mothers and sisters are angry with the drug abuse prevailing in the villages .'
p6765
aS'some women have also addressed the issues of tobacco intake by their husbands .'
p6766
aS'i can understand your pain .'
p6767
aS'some farmers believe that they can only hear the strategies adopted by the government , but it never reaches the villagers .'
p6768
aS'farmers have mentioned that they slog day and night to provide food to the entire nation , but they never receive the full amount of money in return .'
p6769
aS'when they go out to sell the crops and other farm products , there is no one to buy from us .'
p6770
aS'so , they are left with no other option , than to sell the products at lower prices .'
p6771
aS'they are doomed in both the case , if they produce more or less .'
p6772
aS'this means farmers have brought to my notice their inner thoughts through their letters .'
p6773
aS'i can assure all my farmer brothers and sisters that the state and central government will take proper steps actively from now on .'
p6774
aS'i will inspire the government to speed up the actions and provide solutions to all your problems .'
p6775
aS'i can understand that you are losing patience .'
p6776
aS'this is quite natural as you have waited for sixty long years .'
p6777
aS'i will try to find a full-proof solution to this .'
p6778
aS'my farmer brothers , i have found one primary problem among your various questions that is the acquisition of land bill , prevailing in almost all the states .'
p6779
aS'i am shocked to hear these rumours spread across the country .'
p6780
aS'it is good that you have raised such small issues and questions .'
p6781
aS'i will try to bring the truth before you .'
p6782
aS'you must be aware that the acquisition of land bill was passed 120 years ago .'
p6783
aS'post-independence , this law was practised till 60-65 years .'
p6784
aS'today , the activists , who call themselves as the supporters of farmers , also practised this law in the country , governed the country and the farmers got their share .'
p6785
aS'everybody believed that there should be a change in this law and i too believed in the change .'
p6786
aS'we were in the opposition and we too believed in the change of law .'
p6787
aS'in the year 2013 , a new law was passed in haste .'
p6788
aS'we too supported this law giving our full support to the government .'
p6789
aS'if a law benefits the farmers , who would not like to support it , so we too supported the law .'
p6790
aS'but after the initiation of the law , some of the concerns got raised in our minds .'
p6791
aS'we felt that this way we would be betraying the hopes of farmers .'
p6792
aS'we do not have any rights to betray the farmers .'
p6793
aS'on one side , when our government was formed , we saw that all the states raised their voice to amend the law , to improve the law ; the law must be modified to plug the loop holes .'
p6794
aS'on the other side , we found that no state is ready to implement the law , only maharashtra and haryana governments under congress rule had implemented the law who proclaim to be well-wishers of farmers , they brought an ordinance and decided to provide just half of the decided amount as compensation .'
p6795
aS'what kind of justice is this to the farmers ?'
p6796
aS'after reviewing all these points , we felt that there should be some re-thinking .'
p6797
aS'when things are done in haste then some drawbacks remain .'
p6798
aS'the motive might be good but if there are drawbacks , then they should be rectified .'
p6799
aS'now , i will speak of most primary drawback , which you all will find quite astonishing .'
p6800
aS'all the people , who are self-proclaimed well-wishers of farmers are not ready to give any answers to these questions .'
p6801
aS'are you all aware that there are 13 different laws in our country through which most of our countrys land , like railway , national highway and minefields is acquired .'
p6802
aS'are you aware that in the law of previous government , these 13 areas have been excluded from the law ?'
p6803
aS'with this exclusion , i mean that the farmers would receive the same compensation as they used to get under the previous law .'
p6804
aS'you tell me , is this not a drawback ?'
p6805
aS'this was a mistake or not ?'
p6806
aS'this was a mistake or not ?'
p6807
aS'we have modified this law and the farmers would receive four times the compensation , even if these 13 areas be used for railways or highways .'
p6808
aS'we have tried to improve the law .'
p6809
aS'who would say that this amendment is against the farmers ?'
p6810
aS'this is why ; we had brought an ordinance .'
p6811
aS'if we wouldnt have brought the enactment , the lands of farmers would have been used according to the previous law and they would not have received their compensation .'
p6812
aS'when this law was passed , many in the government too raised their voice against this law .'
p6813
aS'even those who were involved in the making of the law , got upset and said that this law is neither beneficial to the farmers , nor the village or to the country .'
p6814
aS'this law can be useful , it was said only to fill the treasury of the officers and for their enjoyment , to promote red-tapism .'
p6815
aS'if this was the truth , apt modifications should have been done or not ?'
p6816
aS'thus , we have tried to eliminate the drawbacks of the law and work on the direction of betterment of the farmers .'
p6817
aS'firstly , we have included the 13 laws which were excluded under the acquisition of land bill , so that the farmers are provided with the remuneration and all rights and they do not have to incur loss due to the exclusion .'
p6818
aS'i have heard the rumours being spread , that modi government is passing a law , which will provide less remuneration to the farmers and they will not receive the full compensation .'
p6819
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters , i can not even think of committing this sin .'
p6820
aS'in the year 2013 , under the dispensation of previous government , the compensation which was decided has not been modified a bit .'
p6821
aS'we have decided to provide four times the compensation than the one provided earlier .'
p6822
aS'not only this , we have also included the 13 areas which were excluded in the earlier law .'
p6823
aS'we have also continued with the clause that in case of acquisition of land for development of the city , the land owners will receive 20 % of the developed land , so that they are benefited financially at all times .'
p6824
aS'the youth of the family gets a job .'
p6825
aS'we have also decided to provide employment to the children of the farmers .'
p6826
aS'we have also added a new programme .'
p6827
aS'the new addition is that the district authorities will have to announce that who will be employed from the family , in what field they will be employed and what will be their work location .'
p6828
aS'government will have to provide written announcement for the same .'
p6829
aS'we have fixed the government responsibility by adding this feature .'
p6830
aS'my dear farmer brother and sisters , we all agree that the government land must be used first .'
p6831
aS'post this , the barren land must be used .'
p6832
aS'lastly , when there is no option left , the farm lands can be touched .'
p6833
aS'so , we have started a survey for finding all the barren lands , for making it a priority for usage .'
p6834
aS'we have received complaints from our farmers that more than the required land is for use is gobbled up .'
p6835
aS'with the enactment of this new law , i can assure you that before using the land , a survey will be conducted , and then it will be decided so that more than the required land is not acquired .'
p6836
aS'sometimes , in the foresight that something is going to happen , there is lot of damage .'
p6837
aS'in the name of social impact assessment ( sia ) , if these judicial proceedings are carried on for several years , how can a farmer take a right decision in this situation ?'
p6838
aS'he can not decide whether to grow the crops in the field , as he is in a fix as he will keep thinking that the judgement can come any day .'
p6839
aS'this will lead to two to four years of loss and things will be stuck due to red-tapism .'
p6840
aS'due to the long and difficult proceedings , a poor farmer is forced to beg before the officers to get their work done sir , please write this , please do not write this .'
p6841
ag1044
ag1044
ag1044
aS'this is going to happen , that is going to happen .'
p6842
aS'i do not want my farmers to fall prey to these officers .'
p6843
aS'i do not think this is a right thing to do .'
p6844
aS'procedures were long and difficult .'
p6845
aS'i have tried to make this procedure simple and easy .'
p6846
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters , the law was passed in the year 2014 , but the states have not adopted the law yet .'
p6847
aS'farmers are still at the same place .'
p6848
aS'states have opposed this law .'
p6849
aS'please tell me if i should listen to the states or not ?'
p6850
aS'i should trust the states or not ?'
p6851
aS'how can a country run without trusting its own states ?'
p6852
aS'so , i believe we should trust our states and we should specially trust our central government .'
p6853
aS'one , i am willing to trust my states and secondly the improvement we are trying to bring in the law by trying to eliminate the drawbacks and trying to better the conditions of the farmers , even after this , if the states are not ready to support this movement , they are free to do so .'
p6854
aS'that is why ; i would like to request you all not to fall prey to these rumours .'
p6855
aS'these rumours are absolutely against farmer rumours .'
p6856
aS'it is part of the conspiracy of keeping the farmers poor as always .'
p6857
aS'this is a part of the conspiracy of not taking the country forward .'
p6858
aS'we have to save ourselves from this conspiracy and save our country and save our farmers as well .'
p6859
aS'now , if one were to ask the farmer residing in the village that what are your plans for your three sons ?'
p6860
aS'he will respond that one of them will carry on with the farming but the other two will have to seek jobs elsewhere .'
p6861
aS'so , now even the sons of farmers are seeking out jobs .'
p6862
aS'they too have to move out and seek employment somewhere .'
p6863
aS'so arrangements need to be made for that too .'
p6864
aS'so we have decided that whatever is important for the welfare of the village , welfare of the farmer and whatever is important for the employment of members of the farming community , all such things should be connected .'
p6865
aS'we are the ones who believe in jai jawan jai kisan .'
p6866
aS'jai jawan is related to the security of the country .'
p6867
aS'as far as the security of the nation is concerned , the farmers of the nation do not ever step back from their responsibilities .'
p6868
aS'if some land is required for national security we will have to ask the farmers for it .'
p6869
aS'and i have complete faith that the farmers will give us the land .'
p6870
aS'so we have added the clause for taking land for such purposes .'
p6871
aS'i want to ask each and every member of the village , is road required or not ?'
p6872
aS'if water is required in the fields , dont we need to create canals ?'
p6873
aS'there are still many poor families in the village who do not have a house to live in .'
p6874
aS'is not land required for construction of houses ?'
p6875
aS'tell me is this for the industrialists ?'
p6876
aS'is this land being demanded for the ultra rich ?'
p6877
aS'try and understand the truth .'
p6878
aS'yes , there is something i want to announce without a doubt .'
p6879
aS'in the new ordinance too , any private industrialist , owner of a manufacturing unit , will have to follow the same set of rules that were laid out in the land acquisition act of 2013 .'
p6880
aS'the rules for the corporates are the same as in 2013 .'
p6881
aS'then why this lies are being spread .'
p6882
aS'my farmer brother and sisters , misunderstanding is being created that you will not get your legal rights , that you can not approach the courts .'
p6883
aS'this is entirely false .'
p6884
aS'no government at the centre can take away your legal rights .'
p6885
aS'the constitution given to us by baba saheb ambedkar ensures that you can approach any court in any part of the country .'
p6886
aS'all we have done is to bring some sort of system to your doorsteps .'
p6887
aS'we have created an authority .'
p6888
aS'now this authority will work at district level and the issues of the farmers will be resolved at the district level itself by the authority .'
p6889
aS'and if you are not satisfied with the solutions offered there you can approach the courts as well .'
p6890
aS'this is the arrangement we have made .'
p6891
aS'there is a misconception that the law related to returning the acquired land in five years has been scrapped .'
p6892
aS'this is not true , dear farmer brothers and sisters , what we have said whenever a project is undertake , a timeline has to be specified in terms of the number of years in which it will be completed .'
p6893
aS'if the project is not completed in the specified time period , then whatever farmers wish has to be adhered to .'
p6894
aS'so we have set a timeframe for government projects .'
p6895
aS'what is the todays case scenario , those lands which were acquired about 40 years ago , the government has not done anything on them .'
p6896
aS'this can not continue any longer .'
p6897
aS'we have decided to set a time limit to governmental projects .'
p6898
aS'yes there are projects which take time , maybe around 20 years .'
p6899
aS'for example if 500 km long railway track is to be laid then it will take time .'
p6900
aS'so we want it all written down , the time frame in which a project will be completed .'
p6901
aS'so , what we are doing is fixing the liability of the government .'
p6902
aS'we have fixed the governments responsibility .'
p6903
aS'let me also tell you something , dear farmer brothers .'
p6904
aS'those sitting in the air conditioned rooms who formulate these rules have no idea of the condition of the villagers .'
p6905
aS'whenever a dam is made or a reservoir is constructed , the rule is to acquire land till the point where there is a possibility of water getting to the maximum level in a span of 100 years .'
p6906
aS'so the water gets filled once in 100 years .'
p6907
aS'for 99 years no water gets filled .'
p6908
aS'yet the land lies with the government .'
p6909
aS'what is currently happening in the states is that land has been acquired , compensation paid and yet farmers are working on those lands .'
p6910
aS'if the land gets flooded once in 100 years , that year the land can be taken .'
p6911
aS'the law of 2013 denied the farmers the right to cultivate the land .'
p6912
aS'all we want is that if the land does not get flooded then it should be available for farmers for cultivation .'
p6913
aS'and hence that land should not be acquired from the farmer .'
p6914
aS'this kind of flexibility is necessary .'
p6915
aS'so the farmer benefits even after giving up the land and also get compensation in lieu of their land .'
p6916
aS'this will doubly benefit the farmers .'
p6917
aS'this kind of organization is both necessary and practical .'
p6918
aS'and we are the ones who have thought about it .'
p6919
aS'another misconception being spread is that consent is not necessary .'
p6920
aS'i urge you , my brothers and sisters to protect yourself from such politically motivated propaganda .'
p6921
aS'the law which was promulgated in 2013 has no provision for consent in schemes for which the government is acquiring land .'
p6922
aS'so people are being misled on this consent issue .'
p6923
aS'the issue of consent did not exist previously , it does not exist now .'
p6924
aS'and so my brothers and sisters , to say that it was beneficial for you before but it is not so now , this is an unfortunate attempt to mislead you .'
p6925
aS'i assure and insist that this consent clause is very much functional in case of private industries , corporate and individual enterprise .'
p6926
aS'another thing i would like to share that some people talk about the ppp model .'
p6927
aS'dear brother and sisters , if a road worth rs.'
p6928
aS'100 crores is made , will the corporate run away with it ?'
p6929
aS'the ownership of the road will be with the government .'
p6930
aS'the ownership of the land is with the government .'
p6931
aS'the construction agency is different .'
p6932
aS'the construction agency is different because the government does not have the requisite amount of money .'
p6933
aS'the government wants that a road be made in the village , as well as hospital and the poor children get education , so monetary investment is required .'
p6934
aS'the private investors construct roads but not for themselves .'
p6935
aS'he does not take it with himself ; he makes it for the government .'
p6936
aS'in a way he invests his money .'
p6937
aS'this means in a government project someone else puts in the money which is called the ppp model .'
p6938
aS'but the ownership rests with the government and government means of all of you , of the 125 crore indians and hence we have said there that there is no need for a consent .'
p6939
aS'hence it was necessary for me to dispel these myths around the ppp model .'
p6940
aS'sometimes this issue of consent will increase red-tapism and nepotism .'
p6941
aS'tell me , there is a village ; a road has been constructed till that village , now a road has to be constructed till the next village which is 5 kms ahead .'
p6942
aS'the road for the first village has been made , but the land for the road to other village lies with the previous village .'
p6943
aS'so tell me will the villagers wilfully give land for road till the other village ?'
p6944
aS'tell me will they give their consent ?'
p6945
aS'so what sin have the people of other village committed ?'
p6946
aS'should they not get the roads ?'
p6947
aS'similarly , if i am making a canal , this village has got the water and we have to provide water supply to another village and the said land falls with the people of the previous village who already have water and they deny giving their consent for acquiring their land and say that we already have the water , we are not going to give consent for land acquisition for supply of water to another village .'
p6948
aS'so now you tell me , the people of the other village should get water or not ?'
p6949
aS'my brothers and sisters , this is a practical issue .'
p6950
aS'so we are evolving a process which does not take long .'
p6951
aS'this is for the farmers right , not for industries and industrialists .'
p6952
aS'it is for the betterment of the villages , the villagers and the benefit of their children .'
p6953
aS'another issue is coming up .'
p6954
aS'i have said this before .'
p6955
aS'in every farmer family , the farmer wants one son to do farming and the others to take up other sources of employment .'
p6956
aS'such are the times today that different efforts need to be mad to run the household .'
p6957
aS'if we make a road and government establishes an industrial corridor next to it , which is not private .'
p6958
aS'i again reiterate that a corridor by the government , not for the rich , or the industrialists , so if the government makes a corridor on the left or right of a 50 or 100 km road , then all the residents of the near those villages maybe 50 , 100 , 200 villages falling along it will have an opportunity for employment , their kin will get employment .'
p6959
aS'tell me dear brother and sisters , do we want the children of our villages to suffocate in the slums of delhi and mumbai .'
p6960
aS'should they not get an employment opportunity closer to their home if a small industry comes up some 20-25 kms away from their village ?'
p6961
aS'so this corridor will be made by the government and will not be private .'
p6962
aS'the government will make these corridors and create these employment opportunities for the villagers .'
p6963
aS'this proposal is about government ownership , it is for the betterment of the villages , betterment of the farmers of villages , it is for the betterment of the future generations of the villagers , it is for the betterment of the poor of the villages , it is to make electricity available to the villages .'
p6964
aS'for these there were some drawbacks in the last land acquisition bill , which we have tried to resolve all the shortcomings of this bill authentically .'
p6965
aS'still i have maintained in the parliament that if anyone feels that there are some short comings , we are ready to make amendments .'
p6966
aS'when we put the bill in the parliament , certain leaders of the farming community gave us some suggestions and we added them .'
p6967
aS'we still say that the land acquisition should be pro farmers .'
p6968
aS'we are committed for this .'
p6969
aS'there are lot of lies being spread .'
p6970
aS'i request you , dear brothers to not get swayed and dont make your decision based on these lies .'
p6971
aS'important issue is how to make farmers strong , how to make our villages strong .'
p6972
aS'the farmer should get the right price for his efforts ; farmers should get a proper market , a proper storage for his production .'
p6973
aS'it is our effort to make right decisions for the betterment of the village and the farmers .'
p6974
aS'dear brothers and sisters , it is our effort to see that the nation progresses and so do our farmers by increasing their yield .'
p6975
aS'and so we have introduced soil health card .'
p6976
aS'if a person falls sick a laboratory test is undertaken for them , similarly a lab test can be undertaken for our motherland .'
p6977
aS'so we are working not only to protect your land but also to make it healthy .'
p6978
aS'and so , not land acquisition , but making the land healthy is our task .'
p6979
aS'and so we have introduced the concept of soil health card .'
p6980
aS'every farmer is going to benefit from it .'
p6981
aS'your undue expenses on fertilizers will be saved .'
p6982
aS'your yield will increase .'
p6983
aS'that you get proper price for your production , there should be proper granaries , proper rules and regulations and that you are saved from exploitation - we are working on all these issues .'
p6984
aS'i remember , when i was the chief minister of gujarat , i worked a lot in this direction .'
p6985
aS'the condition of farmers in our gujarat was very bad , we worked on the water issues and we saw a big change .'
p6986
aS'the farmers made a huge contribution to the development of gujarat which was beyond all expectations .'
p6987
aS'the entire villages would be deserted , but the change happened .'
p6988
aS'we want this type of change in the entire country , which makes our farmers very happy .'
p6989
aS'and so my farmer brother and sisters , today i got an opportunity to talk to you .'
p6990
aS'but the issue of the ordinance is making headlines every day and i chose to speak about it more .'
p6991
aS'but my dear brothers and sisters , i will speak to you again and on other issues .'
p6992
aS'but i want to assure you that whatever you have written to me , i will shake the entire government and will make them see the reality about what is actually happening on the ground .'
p6993
aS'i am happy that you have told me so many things and i believe that you have told me because you trust me .'
p6994
aS'i want to assure you that i will not shatter your faith .'
p6995
aS'i desire your love and blessings at all times .'
p6996
aS'you are the elders of the nation , you can never think wrong for others rather you will suffer loses for others benefit .'
p6997
aS'this has been your tradition .'
p6998
aS'and these farmers do not suffer , should have to be the prime focus of my government .'
p6999
aS'today , after hearing this mann ki baat many thoughts may have arisen in your mind .'
p7000
aS'please do write into me at the akashvani address .'
p7001
aS'i will talk again .'
p7002
aS'based on your letters , i will try to rectify all the mistakes of my government .'
p7003
aS'i will try to speed up the efforts and if somewhere injustice is being done , i will try and provide justice .'
p7004
aS'we are in middle of the auspicious festival of navratri .'
p7005
aS'my heartfelt greetings to you all !'
p7006
aa(lp7007
S'director general , madam bukovaexcellencies , ladies and gentlemen , i am truly honoured to address unesco .'
p7008
aS'i feel specially privileged to visit this great institution in its 70th anniversary year .'
p7009
aS'this milestone reminds us of a fundamental achievement of our age : for the first time in human history , we have an organization for the entire world the united nations .'
p7010
aS'and , through the sweeping change of these decades , through many challenges of our times , and the great progress of this era , the organization has endured and grown .'
p7011
aS'there have been doubts and skepticism .'
p7012
aS'there is need for urgent reforms .'
p7013
aS'but , for the nations that came together at its birth ; and , for three times as many that joined it later , there is one unshakeable belief : our world is and will remain a better place because of the united nations .'
p7014
aS'it is this faith that has given birth to so many of its institutions that deal with every aspect of human challenges .'
p7015
aS'our collective goal is to seek a peaceful and prosperous future for our world , in which every nation has a voice ; all peoples have an identity ; all cultures are flowers in a garden ; every human being has a life of dignity ; every child a future of opportunity ; and our planet the chance to preserve its glory .'
p7016
aS'no organization serves our cause more than this one .'
p7017
aS'the seeds of our collective destiny are sown in human minds .'
p7018
aS'it is nurtured by the light of education and the spirit of enquiry .'
p7019
aS'it makes progress through the marvels of science .'
p7020
aS'and , it draws strength from the basic character of nature the harmony and unity in diversity .'
p7021
aS'that is why unesco was among the first missions of the united nations .'
p7022
aS'that is why india values the work of unesco so deeply ; and , cherishes our partnership so immensely .'
p7023
aS'i am conscious of the extraordinary legacy of our relationship from the time of unescos birth .'
p7024
aS'i recall mahatma gandhis message to unesco , calling for urgent action to address the needs of education to secure lasting peace ; and , the leadership of dr.'
p7025
aS'radhakrishnan , later our first president , in the early years of this institution .'
p7026
aS'we are grateful for unescos support for education and science , in india and for preservation of our cultural heritage .'
p7027
aS'equally , we are privileged to have worked with unesco in support of its mission around the world .'
p7028
aS'for , in the challenges india faces and the dreams that indians seek , our approach mirrors the ideals of unesco .'
p7029
aS'we have built a modern state in an ancient land , with a timeless tradition of openness and co-existence ; and , a society of extraordinary diversity .'
p7030
aS'the foundation of our constitution rests on a fundamental principle : the peace and prosperity of all is indivisible from the welfare of the individual ; the strength of the nation is determined by the joined hands of every citizen ; and , real progress is measured through empowerment of the weakest .'
p7031
aS'this has been our creed since we assumed office nearly a year ago .'
p7032
aS'and , we shall judge our progress not just by the cold statistics of growth , but by the warm glow of belief and hope on human faces .'
p7033
aS'for me , it means many things .'
p7034
aS'we will defend and protect the rights and liberty of every citizen .'
p7035
aS'we will ensure that every citizen , of every faith , culture and creed has an equal place in our society ; belief in her future ; and the confidence to pursue it .'
p7036
aS'education always had a special place in our tradition .'
p7037
aS'as our ancient saying goes , it is , the wealth that increases by giving , that wealth is knowledge and is supreme of all possessionswe have launched the most ambitious programme to provide skills to our youth ; and education for every child in the remotest villages .'
p7038
aS'our progress will remain a mirage unless women no longer suffer from daily fear , or barriers to opportunity ; and , when they are no longer victims of exclusion and prejudice .'
p7039
aS'and , this change must begin with the girl child .'
p7040
aS'so , the programme to educate and support the girl child in india is one that is closest to my heart .'
p7041
aS'we will ensure that they can go to school ; and , also , that they can attend it in safety and dignity .'
p7042
aS'today , the digital age has created opportunities beyond imagination ; but , digital divide can expand disparities .'
p7043
aS'on the other hand , digital connectivity and smart phones have create a revolution of possibilities to educate , deliver services and extend development .'
p7044
aS'this is the most exciting change in our era .'
p7045
aS'our digital india will create a participative , transparent and a responsive government , connected to the citizens .'
p7046
aS'and , we have launched a digital literacy mission to connect each of our 600,000 villages .'
p7047
aS'the link between habitat and fulfillment of human potential is deep and strong .'
p7048
aS'so , the highest priority for my government is to provide a roof over every head ; power in every house ; sanitation and clean water within everyones reach ; a hope for every child to survive ; and a chance for every new mother to love her child .'
p7049
aS'it also means clean rivers , air that we can breathe and forests filled with the sound of birds .'
p7050
aS'to achieve these goals , we need not just policies and resources , but even more the power of science .'
p7051
aS'for us , science is driven by the larger purpose of human development ; and , for a safe , sustainable , prosperous future for india .'
p7052
aS'science also unites people across borders in a shared purpose .'
p7053
aS'and , when we share its fruits with those who dont have it , we connect lives and make our world a better place .'
p7054
aS'india never forgets the help we have received in our early years ; today , we are fulfilling our responsibility to others .'
p7055
aS'therefore , science is a key priority of indias international engagement .'
p7056
aS'culture is a sublime expression of a people ; and , the foundations of a society .'
p7057
aS'unescos initiatives to preserve the worlds cultural heritage , including in india , are inspiring .'
p7058
aS'we see indias rich and diverse cultural heritage as humanitys wealth .'
p7059
aS'and , we will do everything to preserve it for future generations .'
p7060
aS'we have launched heritage development and augmentation yojana hriday or heart in hindi to preserve the cultural heritage of our cities .'
p7061
aS'we have started a special scheme called prasad or offerings ) pilgrimage rejuvenation and spirituality augmentation drive for rejuvenation of our pilgrim centres .'
p7062
aS'madam chairman , i speak of our vision and initiatives , because in our own aspirations and efforts , we see the value of unesco to our world with great clarity .'
p7063
aS'in the challenges of our times , we see its purpose with a sense of urgency .'
p7064
aS'the fault lines in our world are shifting from the boundaries of nations into the web of our societies and the streets of our cities .'
p7065
aS'the threats are changing from domination by states to destruction by groups .'
p7066
aS'we fight today not only over what we claim , but also for who we are .'
p7067
aS'and , in many parts of the world , culture remains a source of conflict .'
p7068
aS'we have access to communication at the click of a mouse .'
p7069
aS'we live in a world of information .'
p7070
aS'yet , we know that familiarity does not always lead to fraternity ; or reduce prejudice .'
p7071
aS'when ebola threatens an entire region ; the fury of unseasonal storms destroys crops and lives ; and , diseases still defeat our most courageous fight , we understand how fragile we are .'
p7072
aS'when we see people living at the edge of existence ; children shut out of classrooms ; and , nations without the human resources to shoulder the responsibility of progress , we know that we still have a long way to go .'
p7073
aS'to be sure , our world has made incredible progress over seven decades .'
p7074
aS'so , our progress should inspire us to meet our challenges .'
p7075
aS'unesco can play a vital role in addressing them .'
p7076
aS'culture must connect , not divide , our world .'
p7077
aS'it should be a bridge to greater respect and understanding between people .'
p7078
aS'it should join nations in peace and harmony .'
p7079
aS'across indias neighbourhood , asia and indian ocean , we are retracing our cultural connections to form a closer bond of friendship in this dynamic region .'
p7080
aS'we must turn deep into our cultures ; traditions ; and religions ; to overcome the rising tide of extremism , violence , and divisions across the world .'
p7081
aS'we must intensify exchanges between the youth of the world to sow the seeds of a more peaceful world .'
p7082
aS'cultures also hold great wealth of traditional knowledge .'
p7083
aS'societies across the world have evolved them through wisdom gathered over the ages .'
p7084
aS'and , they hold the secrets to economic , efficient , and , environment friendly solutions to many of our problems .'
p7085
aS'but , today they are at risk of extinction in our globalised world .'
p7086
aS'so , we must here make more efforts to revive , preserve and nurture traditional knowledge .'
p7087
aS'this will also redefine a fundamental truth about human civilization : as our cultures are diverse , knowledge has many sources .'
p7088
aS'in doing so , we will give ourselves a greater chance to meet our challenges .'
p7089
aS'we must do more to harness science for human welfare in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world especially for health and food security .'
p7090
aS'climate change is a pressing global challenge .'
p7091
aS'and , it calls for a collective human action ; and , a comprehensive response .'
p7092
aS'we must draw upon our entire wealth of wisdom ; the strength of every institution ; all possibilities of innovation ; and , the power of science .'
p7093
aS'in india , faith and nature have had a deep link since ancient times .'
p7094
aS'for us , the only path to prosperity is the sustainable one .'
p7095
aS'we make this choice with the natural instincts of our culture and tradition .'
p7096
aS'but , we also do this with a commitment to our future .'
p7097
aS'we have , for example , set a target of adding 175,000 mw of clean and renewable energy in the next seven years .'
p7098
aS'too often , our discussion is reduced to an argument about emission cuts .'
p7099
aS'but , we are more likely to succeed if we offer affordable solutions , not simply impose choices .'
p7100
aS'that is why i have called for global public action to develop clean energy , that is affordable and accessible to all .'
p7101
aS'and , it is for the same reason that i call for a change in lifestyle .'
p7102
aS'because , the emission reduction that we seek will be the natural outcome of how we live .'
p7103
aS'and , it will also mean a different path to economic well being .'
p7104
aS'it is with this vision that i had called the united nations general assembly last september to declare june 21st as the international day of yoga .'
p7105
aS'yoga awakens a sense of oneness and harmony with self , society and nature .'
p7106
aS'by changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness , it can help us deal with climate change and create a more balanced world .'
p7107
aS'last december , the unga adopted it with a record co-sponsorship in a record time .'
p7108
aS'it was not just an act of friendship for india .'
p7109
aS'it reflected our collective ability to go beyond our familiar boundaries in search for solutions to common challenges .'
p7110
aS'the campaign to clean our ganges river is a mission that connects culture , science , traditional knowledge , education , economy , and , environment ; but , it is also about attitudes and lifestyles .'
p7111
aS'madam chairperson , outside this hall , i paid respect at the statue of a great indian philosopher and sage , shri aurobindo .'
p7112
aS'there is much that we can learn from his humanism and spiritualism , from his belief in the unity of individual consciousness with the world outside ; the enlightened purpose of education ; the service of science ; and , the unity of world , founded on national freedom , diversity of civilizations and autonomy of culture .'
p7113
aS'it is a guiding spirit for the purpose of this institution the defence of peace in the mind of men .'
p7114
aS'the 70th anniversary is a moment to celebrate our remarkable journey so far .'
p7115
aS'it is also a time to look ahead with wisdom that has come with time and experience .'
p7116
aS'whatever we wish to achieve as united nations , unesco will always have a part to play whether it is sustainable development , our post-2015 agenda , climate change or peace and security .'
p7117
aS'unescos responsibilities to our future have become bigger ; and , so our resolve must be stronger .'
p7118
aS'thank you very much for this opportunity .'
p7119
aS'thank you .'
p7120

S'her excellency , chancellor dr.'

aS'johanna wanka , minister-president mr stephan weil chairman of deutsche messe dr.'
p7124
aS'wolfram von fritschit is truly a great privilege for me to be here at the inauguration of the worlds largest industrial fair .'
p7125
aS'inner hminner hm2first , i want to thank the city of hannover and hannover messe .'
p7126
aS'they have been most generous in allowing us to unleash our lions in this city .'
p7127
aS'the lions are a symbol of a new india .'
p7128
aS'they roar ; but with a message of friendship and promise of partnership , from .'
p7129
aS'25 billion people of india .'
p7130
aS'this is also the message of 15 states , 20 ceos and 350 companies from india participating in this fair .'
p7131
aS'your choice of india as a partner country reflects the new confidence in india .'
p7132
aS'our decision to be here in the first year of my government reflects our priority : we want to accelerate economic growth and create jobs for our youth .'
p7133
aS'we want to build world class industry and infrastructure .'
p7134
aS'we want to transform our cities and villages ; clean up our environment ; and improve the quality of life .'
p7135
aS'our presence as a partner country says something else also .'
p7136
aS'we will naturally pursue our goals on the strength of our own resources , skills and enterprise .'
p7137
aS'but , we know that we will be more successful when we do this in partnership with the world .'
p7138
aS'for people in india , germany is a valued partner ; and , an enduring symbol of technology and innovation , quality and productivity .'
p7139
aS'even more , india and germany share a close and warm relationship .'
p7140
aS'it goes back centuries , in the intellectual journey of german scholars .'
p7141
aS'it has grown in depth and diversity from our birth as modern republics at the same time , through the passage of history , indians and germans have formed a relationship of mutual fascination and goodwill .'
p7142
aS'it also includes a vibrant economic partnership that extends beyond the last century .'
p7143
aS'today , you can easily think of companies like siemens as indian !'
p7144
aS'nearly a hundred years ago , indias great poet and philosopher , rabindranath tagore said , that germany has done more than any other country to open india to the western world .'
p7145
aS'today , i come to seek german partnership in my own mission to open up indias seamless economic potential .'
p7146
aS'to the industry of the world that has assembled here today , i say that we have no special bias for our host today !'
p7147
aS'india is open and ready to embrace the world .'
p7148
aS'as i have travelled around the world , i have seen a new level of interest in building partnerships of trade , investment and innovation in india .'
p7149
aS'it mirrors the surge of hope in our own people and industry ; the new tide of expectation in our 800 million youth for opportunities and progress .'
p7150
aS'and , if we want to fulfill the dreams of our youth , we must turn our industry into a manufacturing hub for the world and an engine for employment at home .'
p7151
aS'and , we must equip our youth with the skills to meet the needs of our nation , and the demands of the globalised world .'
p7152
aS'whatever we choose to do , from reaching the cutting edge of industry to meeting the most critical social need , we require investment and technology , industry and enterprise .'
p7153
aS'that is why for me , make in india is not a brand .'
p7154
aS'nor is it simply a slogan on a smart lion !'
p7155
aS'it is a new national movement .'
p7156
aS'and , it covers the whole spectrum of our government , society and business .'
p7157
aS'to this informed audience , i hardly need to state the obvious : our scale of transformation is vast ; therefore , the opportunities we offer are huge .'
p7158
aS'you are also familiar with our demography and our demand .'
p7159
aS'the question that you ask is whether we can turn this potential into a reality ; and , our vision into action .'
p7160
aS'what you seek is not just an attractive destination ; but , also the assurance that it is open ; and , it is easy to reach and work in .'
p7161
aS'you want the confidence that the environment is stable ; the rules wont change frequently ; and there would be no surprises .'
p7162
aS'so , we have moved with speed , resolve and boldness to fulfill our pledge .'
p7163
aS'we are creating a stable economic environment that inspires confidence at home and abroad .'
p7164
aS'we are pursuing strong fiscal discipline to do that .'
p7165
aS'i know how much chancellor merkel will appreciate that point !'
p7166
aS'we have taken sweeping steps to reform our policies and open up more to foreign direct investments in key areas like insurance , construction , defence and railways .'
p7167
aS'railways is the thread that binds india .'
p7168
aS'it will now be a fast track to indias transformation .'
p7169
aS'and , what was a department of the government is now open to 100 % foreign direct investments .'
p7170
aS'we are removing unnecessary regulations and simplifying our procedures .'
p7171
aS'we are using digital technology to eliminate multiple approvals and endless wait .'
p7172
aS'we will guide you and walk with you in your projects .'
p7173
aS'we have set up invest india and country desks in it that will be networked to the states .'
p7174
aS'we will nurture innovation and protect your intellectual property .'
p7175
aS'there were institutions in india that seemed beyond scrutiny .'
p7176
aS'well , they no longer are .'
p7177
aS'we are reforming institutions in ways that has not happened in decades .'
p7178

aa(lp7230
S'friends , i am really happy to be here in the hannover fair .'
p7231
aS'it is an added pleasure to talk to you that too in the presence of chancellor merkel .'
p7232
aS'myself and chancellor merkel had a very good interaction over dinner last night .'
p7233
aS'you also must have met a number of indian companies and ceos .'
p7234
aS'i believe that the participation in hannover fair would be very useful for both sides .'
p7235
aS'i request you to visit the india pavillion and the stalls of our state government and private companies .'
p7236
aS'you will be able to see for yourself the winds of change in india .'
p7237
aS'we are very keen to develop the sectors where you are strong .'
p7238
aS'we need your involvement .'
p7239
aS'the scope and potential , the breadth and length of infrastructure and related developments is very huge in india .'
p7240
aS'just to give you some examples : - we have planned to build 50 million houses by 2022 .'
p7241
aS'in addition , we are going to develop smart cities and mega industrial corridors.'
p7242
aS'- for this purpose , we have refined our fdi policy in construction .'
p7243
aS'we have also come up with a regulatory framework for this sector.'
p7244
aS'- we have targeted 175 giga watt of renewable energy in next few years .'
p7245
aS'in addition to generation , the issues of transmission and distribution of electricity are equally important for us ; - we are modernizing our railway systems including signals , and railway stations .'
p7246
aS'we are planning metro rail in fifty cities and high speed trains in various corridors.'
p7247
aS'- similar is the case with highways.'
p7248
aS'- we are putting up new ports and modernizing the old ones through an ambitious plan called sagarmala ; - similar focus is on upgrading the existing airports and putting up regional airports to enhance connectivity to places of economic and tourist importance.'
p7249
aS'- in financial services too , we are moving towards a more inclusive and faster delivery of financial products including bank loans and insurance.'
p7250
aS'- for this purpose , we opened 140 million bank accounts ; increased fdi in insurance upto 49 % and have set up mudra bank.'
p7251
aS'- we also announced innovative schemes for insurance and pension to enhance social security for our citizens .'
p7252
aS'we also want to promote manufacturing in a big way particularly to create jobs for our youth .'
p7253
aS'for this purpose , we have launched a campaign called make in india .'
p7254
aS'all this is a historic opportunity for the german companies .'
p7255
aS'you would already be knowing the direction of my government and the steps we are taking .'
p7256
aS'we have committed ourselves for creating and improving the business environment .'
p7257
aS'i can assure you that once you decide to be in india , we are confident to make you comfortable .'
p7258
aS'germany ranks 8th among foreign investor countries in india .'
p7259
aS'about 600 indo-german joint ventures are presently operating in india .'
p7260
aS'the purpose of my being here and participating in the hannover fair is to highlight that there is more potential in indo-german economic collaboration .'
p7261
aS'though we have a vibrant relationship , our economic partnership is not as much as both countries would like to have .'
p7262
aS'the flow of investments from germany is well below the potential and less than indian investments in germany .'
p7263
aS'many more german companies have the possibility of investing in india to take advantage of indias potentials .'
p7264
aS'the potential lies in manufacturing as well as infrastructure and in skill development for that purpose .'
p7265
aS'i know that the reason for this situation may not be from german side .'
p7266
aS'it is from the indian side also .'
p7267
aS'i am here to assure the german companies that india is now a changed country .'
p7268
aS'our regulatory regime is much more transparent , responsive and stable .'
p7269
aS'we are taking a long-term and futuristic view on the issues .'
p7270
aS'lot of efforts have been made and are still underway to improve the ease of doing business in the country.'
p7271
aS'- reducing the complicated procedures , making them available at one platform , preferably online , simplifying the forms and formats has been taken up on war footing.'
p7272
aS'- definite mechanisms for hand holding have been set up in the form of hub and spoke .'
p7273
aS'invest india is the nodal agency for this purpose .'
p7274
aS'we do believe that fdi is important and it will not come in the country without a globally competitive business environment .'
p7275
aS'therefore , in this years budget we have rationalized a number of issues which were bothering you .'
p7276
aS'in particular , - we have removed lot of regressive taxation regimes .'
p7277
aS'in our very first budget , we said we will not resort to retrospective taxation .'
p7278
aS'and if such issues do arise , they will have to be reviewed at the highest level .'
p7279
aS'we have taken bold steps of not dragging the litigation in a few cases where we felt that the steps of the previous government were not on right lines.'
p7280
aS'- in this budget , we allowed tax pass through for aifs , rationalization of capital gains of reits , modification in pe norms and deferring the implementation of gaar for two years .'
p7281
aS'we are constantly working to improve the business environment further.'
p7282
aS'- we are trying to introduce an element of transparency and predictability in taxation system.'
p7283
aS'- we have fast tracked approvals in industry and infrastructure .'
p7284
aS'this includes environmental clearances , extending the industrial licences , delicencing of defence items , and simplification of cross-border trade.'
p7285
aS'- within a very short time , we introduced gst bill in parliament .'
p7286
aS'such measures have helped in building up an enhanced investor confidence .'
p7287
aS'the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investments are positive .'
p7288
aS'fdi inflows have gone up by 36 % during april-2014 and january-2015 against the same period in previous year ; our growth rate is about 7 % -plus .'
p7289
aS'most of the international financial institutions including the world bank , imf , unctad , oecd and others are predicting even faster growth and even better in the coming years .'
p7290
aS'moodys have recently upgraded the rating of india as positive on account of our concrete steps in various economic segments .'
p7291
aS'indo-german business summit in hannover ( 5 ) it is the effort of my government to encourage innovation , r & d and entrepreneurship in the country .'
p7292
aS'in this years budget , we have set up some innovative institutional mechanisms for that purpose .'
p7293
aS'similarly , for infrastructure development , we have taken some far reaching steps.'
p7294
aS'- first of all we have made an all-time high allocation for roads and railways sectors.'
p7295
aS'- in addition , we are setting up india infrastructure investment fund.'
p7296
aS'- we have also allowed tax free bonds in the infrastructure sector including roads and railways .'
p7297
aS'i wish all success to the hannover messe .'
p7298
aS'i also wish all participants good luck and progress .'
p7299
aS'i also take this opportunity for inviting more and more german companies to india .'

aS'indo-german partnership should and will flourish .'

aS'let us work together in mutual interest and for welfare of the people of the two great countries .'
p7305
aS'at the end , it is my advice to you to come and feel the change in indias regulatory environment .'
p7306
aS'please do not go by old perceptions .'
p7307
aS'the symbol of lion for make in india has been chosen very carefully .'
p7308
aS'we know that our biggest need today is to create jobs for our 65 % population which is young .'
p7309
aS'hence , make in india is the need .'
p7310
aS'hence , the lion because a lion can not be stopped .'
p7311
aS'we are confident that our journey to make india a global manufacturing hub can not be stopped that too by our own rules and regulations .'
p7312
aS'we must and we will make corrections wherever it is required .'
p7313
aS'once again i invite you to india .'
p7314
aS'i assure you of my personal attention in your success while you are in india .'
p7315
aS'thank you very much .'
p7316
aa(lp7317
S'chancellor merkel , members of the mediai want to sincerely thank chancellor merkel and germany for the very warm welcome that my delegation and i have received .'
p7318
aS'i am especially grateful that in the first year of my government , india was chosen as a partner country for the largest industrial trade fair in the world .'
p7319
aS'chancellor merkel was generous with her time for me , my delegation and the ceos of several indian companies in hannover .'
p7320
aS'today , my delegation and i have once again been heartily welcomed in berlin .'
p7321
aS'i also thank her for the very open , constructive and perceptive discussions on relations between india and germany .'
p7322
aS'this is a reflection of her deep concern for germanys interests and her commitment to india germany relations .'
p7323
aS'yesterday in hannover , she accepted the invitation of indias lion to raise the level of germanys engagement in india and assured me of a strong response by germanys eagle .'
p7324
aS'i believe that there will be a strong partnership between the king of the earth , lion and the king of the skies , the eagle .'
p7325
aS'when i last came to berlin , germany was successful in winning the world cup final .'
p7326
aS'this time in berlin , i feel that we will also be successful in taking the strategic partnership between india and germany to new heights .'
p7327
aS'whenever anyone in india talks about technology , manufacturing or high quality , germany is the first country that comes to the mind .'
p7328
aS'so , it is natural that when india has embarked on a new journey for make in india for economic development and employment , we look forward to germanys strong partnership .'
p7329
aS'whatever objectives we think of in terms of economic transformation and improvement in quality of life of ordinary citizens , technology , skills , innovation and investment will play an important role in it .'
p7330
aS'my objective of coming to germany was not only to invite the german industry to india , but to assure them that they would find an open and stable environment , which would be easy to do business in ; and that they will have my full support to invest and work in india .'
p7331
aS'i feel deeply encouraged by the enthusiasm and interest that i have seen in chancellor merkel and germany .'
p7332
aS'equally , the feedback that i have got will be of great benefit to me in framing our policies .'
p7333
aS'i have also decided that we will establish a mechanism for german companies to facilitate their investment and business in india .'
p7334
aS'our goal of make in india and creating employment for our youth depends on skill development in our country .'
p7335
aS'germany is a world leader in this field .'
p7336
aS'india will have to pursue its skill development programme in accordance with its own circumstances .'
p7337
aS'but at the same time , there is a lot that we can learn from germany .'
p7338
aS'we had a detailed discussion on the subject .'
p7339
aS'similarly , we intend to further strengthen our close cooperation in the areas of science , technology and education .'
p7340
aS'an area that has great priority for me personally and for my country is renewable energy and energy efficiency .'
p7341
aS'as i have already said , we intend to add 175 giga watts of renewable energy during the next seven years .'
p7342
aS'germany is a strong partner in the development of clean energy .'
p7343
aS'we would also like your cooperation on manufacturing of equipment for clean and renewable energy in india ; and enhance our shared efforts to address the challenge of climate change .'
p7344
aS'development of india as a manufacturing hub and expansion of infrastructure of india would also be beneficial for trade .'
p7345
aS'our imports would also grow .'
p7346
aS'and , it is natural that german companies would benefit a lot from it .'
p7347
aS'in this context , i would also like to state that negotiations between india and european union on a broad-based trade and investment agreement have remained stalled for two years .'
p7348
aS'i have requested chancellor merkel that india and european union should resume the negotiations quickly and conclude a balanced and mutually beneficial agreement at the earliest .'
p7349
aS'we would also like to enhance our cooperation in the area of advanced technology and defence manufacturing .'
p7350
aS'i hope that the german companies would participate enthusiastically in this and that your government would support them fully .'
p7351
aS'chancellor merkel and i had also discussed international developments .'
p7352
aS'we in india believe that economic momentum in europe is important for the global economy and european stability for global peace .'
p7353
aS'the world looks to germany for leadership in addressing both challenges .'
p7354
aS'i also congratulate her on the successful outcome of talks with iran .'
p7355
aS'this will be beneficial for the entire region .'
p7356
aS'instability and violence in west asia affects the security of our citizens at home .'
p7357
aS'peaceful and democratic development of afghanistan is important for both of us .'
p7358
aS'the direction that asia-pacific region will take in this century will be of great significance to the entire world .'
p7359
aS'the spread of terrorism is growing and its character is changing .'
p7360
aS'the threat is coming close to us across every region of the world .'
p7361
aS'we need a comprehensive global strategy to deal with this global challenge , in which india and germany can work together .'
p7362
aS'equally , in the coming days , maritime cyber and space security would be a matter of concern to everyone and we should increase our cooperation in this area as well .'
p7363
aS'it is my belief that india and germany are two countries that have earned the right to be permanent members of the united nations security council .'
p7364
aS'our membership will also be beneficial to the world .'
p7365
aS'we both would like to see tangible progress in the united nations security council reforms during the 70th anniversary year of the united nations .'
p7366
aS'we also look forward to a successful outcome of cop-21 in paris this year .'
p7367

aS'this is what i believe in .'
p7452
aS'and i am happy that all the people were evacuated safely without any damage and it should be noted that indias special quality is that our culture is quite old .'
p7453
aS'recently when i visited france , i went to a memorial of the first world war there .'
p7454
aS'the reason for visiting the place was that it is the centenary year of the first world war , but at the same time it is the centenary year of indias valour .'
p7455
aS'this is the centenary year of the sacrifices made by the indian heroes and , meaning the greatest service to humanity is to serve others and how this phrase has been lived by our country ; this year is a centenary year for this reason also .'
p7456
aS'i am saying this because very few people would know that about 15 lakh indian soldiers had put their life at stake during the first world war from 1914 to 1918 .'
p7457
aS'and the indian soldiers did not die for indias cause .'
p7458
aS'india neither wanted to capture any country , nor did it want to take away anyones land .'
p7459
aS'but the indians had shown amazing strength .'
p7460
aS'very few people would know that about 74000 of our soldiers sacrificed their life in the first world war .'
p7461
aS'and this is also a matter of pride that about 9200 soldiers , who lost their life , were bestowed with gallantry award .'
p7462
aS'not only this , there were eleven such individuals who received the highest honour of victoria cross .'
p7463
aS'about 4700 indians had sacrificed their life especially during the world war in march 2015 in france , which has made a memorial as a mark of respect for them .'
p7464
aS'i went there to commemorate and express my gratitude to the strength displayed by our ancestors .'
p7465
aS'if we see all these incidents , then we can say to the world that our country thinks in the direction of peace , happiness and welfare of the world .'
p7466
aS'the country keeps doing something in this direction and if needed put its life at stake .'
p7467
aS'india finds itself in the first row among the highest contributors in the peacekeeping force of the united nation .'
p7468
aS'that is the matter of pride for us .'
p7469
aS'in the last few days , i got the opportunity to accomplish two important tasks .'
p7470
aS'we are to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of respected babasaheb ambedkar .'
p7471
aS'there has been a controversy regarding the land where his memorial was to be built for many years .'
p7472
aS'i am satisfied that the government of india decided to allot the land for building the memorial of babasaheb ambedkar .'
p7473
aS'similarly , there must be an international centre in the name of babasaheb ambedkar in delhi so that the entire world knows this sage , his thoughts and his work .'
p7474
aS'this was also a matter , which was pending for years .'
p7475
aS'i completed and laid the foundation stone of the memorial .'
p7476
aS'i pledged to complete the work in 20 months , which did not happen for 20 years .'
p7477
aS'and at the same time a thought has also come into my mind and we are working on it .'
p7478
aS'even today there are many families in our country that are forced to carry dirt on their head .'
p7479
aS'is it a matter of grace for us that even today some families in our country have to carry the burden of dirt on their head ?'
p7480
aS'with all earnest , i said in the government forum to get us free from this blur in the year when we commemorating babasaheb ambedkar on his 125th birth anniversary .'
p7481
aS'now , we will not tolerate a situation where any poor will have to take load of dirt on his head in our country .'
p7482
aS'for this we need the support of the society , government must also shoulder its responsibility .'
p7483
aS'i need cooperation of people as we have to do this work .'
p7484
aS'babasaheb ambedkar used to say stay educated throughout life .'
p7485
aS'even today , education has not reached many dalits , exploited , and deprived ones in the society , especially girls .'
p7486
aS'we must also pledge on the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedkar .'
p7487
aS'there must not be any son or daughter of the poor remaining illiterate in our villages , cities and locality .'
p7488
aS'government must do its duty .'
p7489
aS'and if it gets the support of the society , then we will definitely feel a sense of satisfaction .'
p7490
aS'i want to share a matter of happiness and share another matter of discomfort as well .'
p7491
aS'i take pride of the fact that two daughters of india have made the country proud .'
p7492
aS'one daughter -saina nehwal became the worlds no .'
p7493
aS'1 in badminton , and the second daughter sania mirza became the worlds top player in tennis doubles tournament .'
p7494
aS'congratulations to both and all the daughters of our country .'
p7495
aS'i feel proud seeing the effort and strength of our own .'
p7496
aS'but sometimes , we lose cool .'
p7497
aS'when the cricket world cup was on and we lost to australia in the semi-finals , the kind of words used and the treatment meted out to the players was not good my countrymen .'
p7498
aS'how can be a game with no defeat ?'
p7499
aS'victory and defeat are part and parcel of life .'
p7500
aS'if the players of our country have been beaten in a match , then we must encourage them in the times of crisis .'
p7501
aS'there must be an effort to create an environment to generate new confidence .'
p7502
aS'i am sure that we will learn from the defeats going forward and we will not lose control in few moments by indulging in action-reaction .'
p7503
aS'and i am getting worried .'
p7504
aS'whenever i see that anything happens all of a sudden , a mob surrounds and burns the truck , burns the vehicle .'
p7505
aS'and we see these things on tv as well .'
p7506
aS'accident must not happen .'
p7507
aS'even the government must make full effort .'
p7508
aS'but my dear countrymen tell me if we should burn the vehicles ?'
p7509
aS'dead ones do not come back .'
p7510
aS'cant we ensure law to take its due course keeping our emotion in check ?'
p7511
aS'well , today my mind has been very grief-stricken due to these incidents , especially due to natural disasters .'
p7512
aS'but amidst this also , we will move forward with courage and confidence .'
p7513
aS'be it individual of this country - dalit , oppressed , exploited , tribe , villager , poor , farmer , small businessman , we will move forward on the path of welfare for everyone .'
p7514
aS'examinations of students are over .'
p7515
aS'especially , the students of 10th and 12th standard must have made a program of celebrating the holidays .'
p7516
aS'i wish all of you a very good vacation ; get the opportunity to learn something new .'
p7517
aS'and since you have worked hard the whole year , then i wish that you spend some time with your family with joy and happiness .'
p7518
aS'namaskar to everyone .'
p7519
aS'thank you !'

aa(lp7521
S'premier li keqiang president of cpaffc madame li xiaolin honble chief ministers , governors and mayors this is a historic moment in the relationship between india and china .'
p7522
aS'today , we are launching a new vehicle for advancing cooperation between our two countries .'
p7523
aS'in times to come , this will become one of the most important instruments for deepening our economic partnership and contact between our people .'
p7524
aS'as someone who has been chief minister for thirteen years and prime minister for one , this forum has a special place in my heart .'
p7525
aS'but , it is not just my sentiments that lead me to give such importance to this new institution .'
p7526
aS'it comes from a serious conviction , born from my experience , that states have a vital role to play in the national development .'
p7527
aS'this is especially true for large and populous countries , with a high degree of geographical , social and economic diversity .'
p7528
aS'it becomes even more relevant , when the constitutional and political systems are federal in structure .'
p7529
aS'these attributes exist in both india and china , the worlds two most populous nations .'
p7530
aS'in indias constitution , state governments have predominant role in economic and social development .'
p7531
aS'the central government creates the macro-economic environment .'
p7532
aS'it can set the broad social and economic agenda and directions for the nation .'
p7533
aS'it can launch development policies and schemes .'
p7534
aS'it can manage resources .'
p7535
aS'but , in the end , the state governments have an important role in their implementation .'
p7536
aS'but , as i saw in my own experience , state governments can take innumerable initiatives for the development of the states .'
p7537
aS'that is the level of autonomy and responsibility that they enjoy under our constitution .'
p7538
aS'in the same national environment , states are performing at different levels .'
p7539
aS'for business investors , too , whether they are indian or foreign , their journey may begin in delhi , but their success ultimately depends on state capitals .'
p7540
aS'many of the critical requirements for success infrastructure , land , utilities , skilled human resources and many approvals ultimately depend on the state governments .'
p7541
aS'but , for me , the involvement of states in our national effort is not just because of their constitutional and legal responsibilities .'
p7542
aS'it is also stems from a basic management principle .'
p7543
aS'the chances of success are higher when we create a sense of participation for everyone ; when we give everyone a stake in success .'
p7544
aS'that is why i speak of team india .'
p7545
aS'that is why i believe that the foundation for indias development will not be the single pillar of the central government , but 30 pillars comprising the central government and all our states .'
p7546
aS'it follows from the simple logic of science that this foundation will be stronger and more stable .'
p7547
aS'it can support a much taller structure of development .'
p7548
aS'that is why i speak of cooperative federalism , when the centre and the states are partners .'
p7549
aS'i also speak of cooperative and competitive federalism , in which states compete with each other to attract investments and jobs .'
p7550
aS'we have moved quickly in the past year to give shape to this vision .'
p7551
aS'when we replaced the old planning commission with the institution called niti ayog , we gave a formal place and role for state governments in an institution of this nature for the first time in india .'
p7552
aS'we have radically increased the amount of resources that the central government must transfer to the state governments .'
p7553
aS'and , when we began to raise large revenues from the auction of our coal , it also filled the coffers of the states where the mines are located .'
p7554
aS'i am asking my ministries to move conferences out of delhi to state capitals and other cities , so that they do get the benefits that come from hosting such events .'
p7555
aS'more than anything else , we deal with the state governments in a spirit of partnership and with sensitivity to their concerns .'
p7556
aS'and , in doing so , we do not look at the symbol of the political party that is in power in the state .'
p7557
aS'which is why , when i invited state governments to participate in this event , i did considered the linkages of their states with china , but also broader political representation .'
p7558
aS'every nation needs strong international partnerships for its progress .'
p7559
aS'the linkage has deepened in an integrated world .'
p7560
aS'as international partnerships in trade , investments , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and health grow , state governments have a stake in them and responsibility for their success .'
p7561
aS'i have found , both through outbound and inbound state delegations , that state level interactions can be often more focused and productive .'
p7562
aS'a number of decisions can be taken quickly by the state governments .'
p7563
aS'these interactions also make the state governments more sensitive and aware of the international dynamics and requirements .'
p7564
aS'therefore , i attach great significance to this forum .'
p7565
aS'it is the first that india has with any country .'
p7566
aS'and , it is appropriate that it has started with china .'
p7567
aS'we are two of the worlds largest economies and among its fastest growing major economies .'
p7568
aS'we have enormous economic synergies .'
p7569
aS'we also face similar challenges .'
p7570
aS'we have some similar experiences .'
p7571
aS'we have both seen differences in the pace of development in different parts of our countries .'
p7572
aS'our economic relations are growing rapidly .'
p7573
aS'during president xis visit last year , we set for ourselves an ambitious plan to take our economic relations to a new level .'
p7574
aS'we agreed on china setting up two industrial parks in india in maharashtra and gujarat .'
p7575
aS'we are pleased that both chief ministers are here .'
p7576
aS'we have agreed on cooperation in the upgrading of indias railway sector .'
p7577
aS'i have invited chinese companies to invest in indias manufacturing sector .'
p7578
aS'president xi spoke of 20 billion dollars of chinese investments over the next five years .'
p7579
aS'some of the business agreements will take shape in shanghai tomorrow .'
p7580
aS'i believe it will be much easier to translate our vision into reality , if provincial and state governments come into closer contacts .'
p7581
aS'it will also serve our other interests especially promoting greater people-to-people contacts , which is at the heart of all relationships .'
p7582
aS'between india and china , we already have sister-state relationships between gujarat and guangdong .'
p7583
aS'we also have a number of sister-city relations .'
p7584
aS'during this visit , we will see the launch of karnataka sichuan relations and four sister-city relationships .'
p7585
aS'it is also consistent with this spirit that president xi began his visit to india in ahmedabad and i started this visit in xian .'
p7586
aS'these are welcome developments .'
p7587
aS'we are truly taking our relationship outside our national capitals to state capitals and cities .'
p7588
aS'so , it is a great pleasure for me to join premier li in launching this forum .'
p7589
aS'it will have our full support .'
p7590
aS'and , i wish it all success .'
p7591
aS'thank you .'
p7592
aa(lp7593
S'excellency , li keqiang , members of the press , ladies and gentlemen , let me start by expressing my deep gratitude to president xi , premier li and the people of china for the exceptional welcome and hospitality .'
p7594
aS'iam very grateful to president xi for his special gesture of hosting me in xian ; and , for showing me the citys extraordinary heritage .'
p7595
aS'it is a treasure of the world .'
p7596
aS'xian is also a symbol of our ancient spiritual and cultural links .'
p7597
aS'i havea personal connection with xian through monk xuanzang .'
p7598
aS'he visited my hometown 1400 years ago .'
p7599
aS'i am pleased to visit china in the first year of my government .'
p7600
aS'this is one of our most important strategic partnerships .'
p7601
aS'the reason is obvious .'
p7602
aS'the re-emergence of india and china and their relationship will have a profound impact on the two countries and the course of this century .'
p7603
aS'our relationship has been complex in recent decades .'
p7604
aS'but , we have a historic responsibility to turn this relationship into a source of strength for each other and a force of good for the world .'
p7605
aS'we are committed to set a new direction between the two largest asian countries .'
p7606
aS'i believe that my discussions with president xi and premier li have advanced our relationship in that direction .'
p7607
aS'our conversations were candid , constructive and friendly .'
p7608
aS'we covered all issues , including those that trouble smooth development of our relations .'
p7609
aS'i stressed the need for china to reconsider its approach on some of the issues that hold us back from realizing full potential of our partnership .'
p7610
aS'i suggested that china should take a strategic and long term view of our relations .'
p7611
aS'i found the chinese leadership responsive .'
p7612
aS'on the boundary question , we agreed that we continue to explore a fair , reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution .'
p7613
aS'we both reiterated our strong commitment to make all efforts to maintain peace and tranquility in the border region .'
p7614
aS'i found sensitivity to our concerns on this issue ; and , interest in further intensifying confidence building measures .'
p7615
aS'i also reiterated the importance of clarification of line of actual control in this regard .'
p7616
aS'i sought tangible progress on issues relating to visa policy and trans-border rivers .'
p7617
aS'i also discussed some of our regional concerns .'
p7618
aS'we agreed that as we move ahead , we should be sensitive to each others interests ; strengthen mutual trust and confidence ; continue to manage our differences with maturity ; and , seek solutions to outstanding issues.'
p7619
ag1044
aS'our decision to enhance strategic communication and coordination on our region is especially significant .'
p7620
aS'bilateral cooperation was a very important part of our discussion .'
p7621
aS'we have set a high level of ambition for our economic partnership .'
p7622
aS'we see enormous bilateral opportunities and many similar challenges , like urbanization .'
p7623
aS'we are pleased with the progress on the commitments from the summit last september .'
p7624
aS'this includes cooperation in the railways , where we have identified specific projects , and the two chinese industrial parks in gujarat and maharashtra .'
p7625
aS'i am pleased that the two chief ministers are here with me .'
p7626
aS'both leaders were very supportive about increased chinese participation in our make in india mission and infrastructure sector .'
p7627
aS'in shanghai tomorrow , we will see over twenty ventures in the private sector take concrete shape .'
p7628
aS'president xi and premier li were very receptive to the specific concerns i had raised on our growing trade deficit .'
p7629
aS'we look forward to early impact on the ground .'
p7630
aS'we have agreed to create a high-level task force to develop a strategic road-map to expand economic relations .'
p7631
aS'it will cover a broad range of areas including infrastructure , it , pharma , agriculture and manufacturing .'
p7632
aS'an area of high priority for us is people-to-people contacts .'
p7633
aS'indians and chinese dont know each other well , much less understand each other .'
p7634
aS'we have decided to take the relationship out of the narrow confines of governments in the national capitals to states , cities and our people .'
p7635
aS'for the first time , india has launched a state and provincial leaders forum with any country .'
p7636
aS'this is consistent with my firm commitment to cooperative federalism in india .'
p7637
aS'this is the year of india in china ; the next one will be the year of china in india .'
p7638
aS'this will expand tourism between our two countries .'
p7639
aS'we are establishing a centre for gandhian and indian studies in shanghai , a yoga college in kunming and a bilateral think-tanks forum .'
p7640
aS'the nathu la route for indian pilgrims to visit kailash mansarovar will become operational in june .'
p7641
aS'i want to thank china for that .'
p7642
aS'our decision to open a consulates in chengdu and chennai reflects growing mutual confidence and shared commitment to expand our relationship .'
p7643
aS'these steps will help make our relationship more broad-based and people-centric .'
p7644
aS'finally , we have many common global and regional interests .'
p7645
aS'for example , we have a shared interest in the outcome of the international climate change negotiations .'
p7646
aS'we are both trying to strengthen regional connectivity .'
p7647
aS'terrorism is a shared threat .'
p7648
aS'instability in west asia matters to both of us .'
p7649
aS'peace and progress in afghanistan benefits us both .'
p7650
aS'i am confident that our international partnership will deepen .'
p7651
aS'today , we have signed over 20 agreements , covering diverse areas of cooperation .'
p7652
aS'this shows the depth and maturity of our relationship and the positive direction of our partnership .'
p7653
aS'this has been a very productive and positive visit .'
p7654
aS'i look forward to working with president xi and premier li .'
p7655
aS'i have welcomed president xis proposal to hold regular summits to realize our vision for the relationship .'
p7656
aS'i have also invited premier li to visit india at an early date .'
p7657
aS'i look forward to shanghai tomorrow .'
p7658
aS'thank you .'
p7659
aS'thank you , very much .'
p7660
aa(lp7661
S'qiu yong , president of tsinghua university foreign minister wang yi shi yigong , assistant president of tsinghua university i am truly delighted to be at the tsinghua university today .'
p7662
aS'you are a world class institution .'
p7663
aS'you are a symbol of success of chinas education sector .'
p7664
aS'you are the foundation for chinas economic miracle .'
p7665
aS'you have produced great leaders , including president xi .'
p7666
aS'it is not surprising that chinas economic growth and its new leadership in research , science and technology have taken place together .'
p7667
aS'i particularly like the old chinese saying , if you think in terms of a year , plant a seed ; if you think in terms of ten years , plant trees ; if you think in terms of 100 years , teach the people .'
p7668
aS'in india , too , the ancient saying is vyaye krate vardhate eva nityam , vidhya dhanam sarva dhan pradhanam the wealth that increases by giving , that wealth is knowledge and is supreme of all possessions .'
p7669
aS'this is one example of how our two nations are united in their timeless wisdom .'
p7670
aS'there is much more , though , that links our two ancient civilizations .'
p7671
aS'i began my journey in china in xian .'
p7672
aS'in doing so , i retraced the footsteps of the chinese monk xuanzang .'
p7673
aS'he travelled to india from xian in the seventh century in search of knowledge and returned to xian as a friend and chronicler of india .'
p7674
aS'president xis visit in india last september started from ahmedabad .'
p7675
aS'it is not far from vadnagar , my birthplace , but important , because it hosted xuanzang and many pilgrims from china .'
p7676
aS'the worlds first large scale educational exchange programme took place between india and china during the tang dynasty .'
p7677
aS'records talk of about 80 indian monks coming to china and nearly 150 chinese monks returning after their education in india .'
p7678
aS'and yes , this was in the 10th and 11th century .'
p7679
aS'mumbais rise as a port and a shipbuilding centre is because of cotton trade with china .'
p7680
aS'and , those who love silk and textiles know that indias famous tanchoi sarees owe themselves to three brothers from my state of gujarat who learnt the art of weaving from chinese masters in the 19th century .'
p7681
aS'and , in an unquestionable evidence of our ancient trade , silk in our classical sanskrit language is called cinapatta .'
p7682
aS'so , the centuries-old story of our relations has been of spiritualism , learning , art and trade .'
p7683
aS'it is a picture of respect for each others civilisation and of shared prosperity .'
p7684
aS'it is reflected in the human values of dr.'
p7685
aS'dwarkanath kotnis , a doctor from india , who treated soldiers in china during the second world war .'
p7686
aS'today , after difficult and sometimes dark passages of history , india and china stand at a rare moment of vast and multiple transitions in the world .'
p7687
aS'perhaps , the most significant change of this era is the re-emergence of china and india .'
p7688
aS'the worlds two most populous nations are undergoing economic and social transformation on a scale and at a speed that is unmatched in history .'
p7689
aS'chinas success over the past three decades has changed the character of the global economy .'
p7690
aS'india is now the next frontier of the economic revolution .'
p7691
aS'we have the demography for it .'
p7692
aS'about 800 million people in india are below the age of 35 years .'
p7693
aS'their aspirations , energy , enterprise and skills will be the force for indias economic transformation .'
p7694
aS'we now have the political mandate and the will to make it happen .'
p7695
aS'over the past year , we have moved with a clear and coherent vision .'
p7696
aS'and , we have acted with speed , resolve and boldness to implement it .'
p7697
aS'we have taken sweeping steps to reform our policies and open up more to foreign direct investments .'
p7698
aS'this includes new areas like insurance , construction , defence and railways .'
p7699
aS'we are eliminating unnecessary regulations and simplifying our procedures .'
p7700
aS'we are using digital technology to eliminate multiple approvals and endless wait .'
p7701
aS'we are building a tax regime that is predictable , stable and competitive , and that will integrate the indian market .'
p7702
aS'we are scaling up investments in next generation infrastructure roads , ports , railways , airports , telecom , digital networks and clean energy .'
p7703
aS'our resources are being allocated with speed and transparency .'
p7704
aS'and , we will make sure that land acquisition does not become a barrier to growth or a burden on farmers .'
p7705
aS'we are creating the global skill pool to establish a modern economy with a world class manufacturing sector .'
p7706
aS'we are reviving our agriculture sector to restore the fortunes of our farmers and boost our growth .'
p7707
aS'like china , urban renewal is both a necessity and a means to add energy to our economy .'
p7708
aS'we are combining traditional strategies with modern economic instruments to eliminate poverty and create security for the poor .'
p7709
aS'we have launched major schemes on financial inclusion of all , providing funds to the un-banked , and ensuring efficient and direct transfer of benefits to the poor .'
p7710
aS'and , we are ensuring that insurance and pension schemes reach the poorest .'
p7711
aS'we have set time bound goals for providing access to housing , water and sanitation for all .'
p7712
aS'this wont just transform lives , but also generate a new source of economic momentum .'
p7713
aS'above all , we are changing the way we govern ourselves not just in the way we work in new delhi , but also in the way we work together with state governments , districts and cities .'
p7714
aS'because we know , as you do , that our vision may be formed in delhi , but our success will be determined by state capitals .'
p7715
aS'that is why i am here today with two chief ministers , which is a new aspect of our foreign policy .'
p7716
aS'and , for the first time for india , premier li and i will sit with provincial leaders and chief ministers to discuss our partnership .'
p7717
aS'i know that rewriting policies can be easier than changing mindsets and work culture .'
p7718
aS'but , we are on the right path .'
p7719
aS'you will feel the change in india .'
p7720
aS'and , you can see it in our growth rate .'
p7721
aS'it has now increased to 7.'
p7722
aS'5 % , and we are encouraged by international experts speak in one voice of higher growth rates .'
p7723
aS'in many ways , our two countries reflect the same aspirations , similar challenges and the same opportunities .'
p7724
aS'we can be inspired by each others successes .'
p7725
aS'and , in the global uncertainties of our times , we can reinforce each others progress .'
p7726
aS'perhaps , no other economy in the world offers such opportunities for the future as indias .'
p7727
aS'and , few partnerships are as filled with promise as ours .'
p7728
aS'during president xis visit last september , we set for ourselves a new level of ambition for our cooperation .'
p7729
aS'partnership in modernizing indian railways , two chinese industrial parks in india , commitments of 20 billion dollars in investments into india over the next five years partnership in our make in india mission : this is the shape of our future .'
p7730
aS'tomorrow in shanghai , we will see the agreements on first of those partnerships between our industries .'
p7731
aS'but , to maintain this partnership over the long run , we must also improve the access of indian industry to the chinese market .'
p7732
aS'i am encouraged by president xis and premier lis commitment to resolve this problem .'
p7733
aS'as much as our bilateral cooperation , our international partnership will be important for each others success .'
p7734
aS'our changing world has created new opportunities and challenges .'
p7735
aS'we both face instability in our shared neighbourhood that can threaten our security and slow down our economies .'
p7736
aS'the spreading tide of extremism and terrorism is a threat we both face ; for both , its source is in the same region .'
p7737
aS'we must also deal with the changing character of terrorism that has made it less predictable and more diffuse .'
p7738
aS'we source a large part of our energy from the same region that faces instability and uncertain future .'
p7739
aS'india and china conduct their international commerce on the same sea lanes .'
p7740
aS'the security of sea lanes is vital for our two economies ; and , our cooperation is essential to achieve it .'
p7741
aS'equally , we both seek to connect a fragmented asia .'
p7742
aS'there are projects we will pursue individually .'
p7743
aS'there are few such as the bangladesh , china india myanmar corridor that we are doing jointly .'
p7744
aS'but , geography and history tell us that the dream of an interconnected asia will be successful , when india and china work together .'
p7745
aS'we are two countries that have gained a lot from an open , rule-based global trading system .'
p7746
aS'equally , we have most to lose if it breaks down .'
p7747
aS'we both have enormous stakes in the international negotiations on climate change .'
p7748
aS'our cooperation in these forums will be crucial to shape their outcomes .'
p7749
aS'today , we speak of asias resurgence .'
p7750
aS'it is the result of the rise of many powers in the region at the same time .'
p7751
aS'it is an asia of great promise , but also many uncertainties .'
p7752
aS'asias re- emergence is leading to a multi-polar world that we both welcome .'
p7753
aS'but , it is also an unpredictable and complex environment of shifting equations .'
p7754
aS'we can be more certain of a peaceful and stable future for asia if india and china cooperate closely .'
p7755
aS'a resurgent asia is seeking a bigger voice in global affairs .'
p7756
aS'india and china seek a greater role in the world .'
p7757
aS'it may be reforms in the united nations security council or the new asian infrastructure investment bank .'
p7758
aS'but , asias voice will be stronger and our nations role more influential , if india and china speak in one voice - for all of us and for each other .'
p7759
aS'simply put , the prospects of the 21st century becoming the asian century will depend in large measure on what india and china achieve individually and what we do together .'
p7760
aS'the rising fortunes of 2.'
p7761
aS'5 billion pairs of joined hands will be of the greatest consequence for our region and the humanity .'
p7762
aS'this is the vision that i share with president xi and premier li .'
p7763
aS'this is the impulse that is driving our relationship .'
p7764
aS'in recent years , we have deepened our political engagement .'
p7765
aS'we have kept our borders peaceful .'
p7766
aS'we have managed our differences and not allowed them to impede closer cooperation .'
p7767
aS'we have enhanced our cooperation across the full spectrum of our relationship .'
p7768
aS'yet , if we have to realise the extraordinary potential of our partnership , we must also address the issues that lead to hesitation and doubts , even distrust , in our relationship .'
p7769
aS'first , we must try to settle the boundary question quickly .'
p7770
aS'we both recognise that this is historys legacy .'
p7771
aS'resolving it is our shared responsibility to the future .'
p7772
aS'we must move ahead with new purpose and determination .'
p7773
aS'the solution we choose should do more than settle the boundary question .'
p7774
aS'it should do so in a manner that transforms our relationship and not cause new disruptions .'
p7775
aS'we have been remarkably successful in maintaining peace and tranquility along the border .'
p7776
aS'we must continue to do that on the principle of mutual and equal security .'
p7777
aS'our agreements , protocols and border mechanisms have been helpful .'
p7778
aS'but , a shadow of uncertainty always hangs over the sensitive areas of the border region .'
p7779
aS'it is because neither side knows where the line of actual control is , in these areas .'
p7780
aS'that is why i have proposed resuming the process of clarifying it .'
p7781
aS'we can do this without prejudice to our position on the boundary question .'
p7782
aS'we should think of creative solutions to issues that have become irritants - from visa policies to trans-border rivers .'
p7783
aS'sometimes , small steps can have a deep impact on how our people see each other .'
p7784
aS'we are both increasing our engagement in our shared neighbourhood .'
p7785
aS'this calls for deeper strategic communication to build mutual trust and confidence .'
p7786
aS'we must ensure that our relationships with other countries do not become a source of concern for each other .'
p7787
aS'and , wherever possible and feasible , we should work together , as we did in responding to the earthquake in nepal .'
p7788
aS'if the last century was the age of alliances , this is an era of inter-dependence .'
p7789
aS'so , talks of alliances against one another have no foundation .'
p7790
aS'in any case , we are both ancient civilizations , large and independent nations .'
p7791
aS'neither of us can be contained or become part of anyones plans .'
p7792
aS'so , our partnership in international forums should not be determined by the concerns of others , but the interests of our two countries .'
p7793
aS'chinas support for indias permanent membership of a reformed un security council , and for indias membership of export control regimes like nuclear suppliers group will do more than just strengthen our international cooperation .'
p7794
aS'it will take our relationship to a new level .'
p7795
aS'it will give asia a stronger voice in the world .'
p7796
aS'if we are able to deepen mutual trust and confidence , we will also be able to reinforce each others efforts of connecting asia with itself and rest of the world .'
p7797
aS'our soldiers face each other on the border , but we should also deepen our defence and security cooperation to address our many common challenges .'
p7798
aS'above all , as we look ahead , we must build more bridges of familiarity and comfort between our people .'
p7799
aS'about 33 % of the worlds population is either indian or chinese .'
p7800
aS'yet , our people know very little of each other .'
p7801
aS'we must seek inspiration from the pilgrims of the ancient times , who braved the unknown in search of knowledge , and enriched us both .'
p7802
aS'so , we have decided to extend electronic tourist visas to chinese nationals .'
p7803
aS'we are celebrating the year of india in china in 2015 .'
p7804
aS'we are launching the provincial and state leaders forum today .'
p7805
aS'later today , we will have the yoga-taichi event .'
p7806
aS'it will represent the coming together of our two civilizations .'
p7807
aS'we are starting the gandhi and india study centre in fudan university and a college of yoga in kunming .'
p7808
aS'the second route to kailash mansarovar for indian pilgrims will start in june , for which i want to thank president xi .'
p7809
aS'these are just some of the many steps india and china are taking to bring the worlds two largest populations in closer contact .'
p7810
aS'for this reason , i chose to speak today at a university .'
p7811
aS'because it is the youth that will inherit the future of our countries and the responsibility for our relationship .'
p7812
aS'president xi has spoken eloquently about the inter-connected dreams of china and india and the new type of relationship between major countries .'
p7813
aS'not only are our dreams inter-connected , our future is also deeply inter- connected .'
p7814
aS'we are at a moment , when we have the opportunity to make our choices .'
p7815
aS'india and china are two proud civilizations and two great nations that will fulfill their destinies .'
p7816
aS'we each have the strength and the will to choose our own paths to success .'
p7817
aS'but , we have the ancient wisdom to know that our journey will be smoother and our future brighter , when we will walk together , confident of one another , and in step with each other .'
p7818
aS'thank you very much and thanks for your invitation , thanks a lot .'
p7819
aa(lp7820
S'all the dignitaries present and dear student friends , this is a moment of great happiness for me as i am going to be a part of that pious job which will instill a sense of pride for centuries to come .'
p7821
aS'there might be a few leaders in the world that would have an opportunity to interact with the students of two universities in such a short span of three days while visiting other countries as a guest .'
p7822
aS'very few people might be as fortunate as i am and i am grateful to you for this .'
p7823
aS'the basics of india is philosophy and it is also mentioned in the vedas that the light of knowledge should flow free from all directions .'
p7824
aS'our philosophy enunciates gyan bhadro .'
p7825
aS'thoughts and knowledge knows no boundaries , neither east or west .'
p7826
aS'they are eternal and knowledge from any part of the world can be useful for the development of human culture .'
p7827
aS'just now , two chinese students quoted different slokas from the ancient indian texts .'
p7828
aS'they said and i quote nainam chindanti shastrani nainam dahti pavakaha .'
p7829
aS'they presented their views in a manner which can act as a storehouse of knowledge for the world .'
p7830
aS'the soul is never born , the soul never dies .'
p7831
aS'the soul can not be destroyed nor can it ever be burnt .'
p7832
aS'i understand that the chinese students here summed up the ancient indian philosophy before you .'
p7833
aS'they mentioned the gita too which states ma faleshu kadachina meaning to do ones duty wholeheartedly without seeking anything in return .'
p7834
aS'it requires intent to study about mahatma gandhi or india .'
p7835
aS'and if india and china were to scan the history of their rich cultural heritage , we will discover that both were nations of ardent learners , they were courageous to gain new knowledge and were ready to take pains for it .'
p7836
aS'huen tsang came to india some 1400 years ago and similarly academic indians must have travelled to china and all for the sake of knowledge .'
p7837
aS'such boldness was displayed to acquire knowledge , to learn about different cultures and traditions .'
p7838
aS'it is easy to open the doors for trade and economic reasons .'
p7839
aS'it is easy to invite tourists from all over the world .'
p7840
aS'but opening the doors for knowledge requires immense courage .'
p7841
aS'if one is not strong internally then one is scared of being engulfed by the ideas of others .'
p7842
aS'will those ideas overpower us ?'
p7843
aS'when a person is strong within , he is open to the views and ideas of others .'
p7844
aS'and so china today after the age of buddha is keen to learn about the great cultural heritage through the life of gandhi , i think this in itself is a big and important event .'
p7845
aS'those relations that are borne out of economic considerations are profit and loss centric .'
p7846
aS'but the relations that are fostered through knowledge , work on the principle of welfare of the future generations .'
p7847
aS'mahatma gandhi , though born in a corner of india was a global figure , he was an icon and the various crises that the world is struggling with , can his ideologies show a way out ?'
p7848
aS'the world today is facing two major crises one is global warming and the other is terrorism .'
p7849
aS'gandhis ideologies have solution to both these problems , which means the students of this university through gandhian study can outline the relevance of gandhi in todays age through mankind not just for china but for the world .'
p7850
aS'a chinese person mr zen centi , admired gandhi and came to live in sabarmati ashram in 1925 .'
p7851
aS'he stayed there as gandhijis disciple .'
p7852
aS'the ashram inmates could not pronounce his name correctly for it was a chinese name .'
p7853
aS'so mahatma gandhi wrote his name as shanti jain .'
p7854
aS'similarly a chinese scholar tang yung shan was close to rabindra nath tagore .'
p7855
aS'he has written that when he met mahatma gandhi , gandhiji was full of praise for china .'
p7856
aS'zen centi after staying with mahatma gandhi returned to china and started a newspaper by the name penang .'
p7857
aS'in 1930 gandhiji was fighting a big battle for indias independence .'
p7858
aS'he was lodged in yerwada jail in pune and was on a fast unto death in the jail .'
p7859
aS'when zen centi learned about it , he immediately came to india and requested to meet gandhiji .'
p7860
aS'gandhiji had refused to meet anyone inside the jail during his fast .'
p7861
aS'but such was his love for zen centi that gandhiji met him in the jail .'
p7862
aS'such was his love for a chinese citizen .'
p7863
aS'21st century belongs to asia .'
p7864
aS'china and india together make for a third of the worlds population .'
p7865
aS'if this one third population is benefitted and is free of problems , then a third of the world will be freed of crises .'
p7866
aS'so india and china should together scale new heights , with humanitarian approach , with humanity , based on buddhist ideology and gandhian experiments , so that we can inspire the world to lead a life which is committed to the welfare of the world .'
p7867
aS'my heartfelt congratulations to fudan university towards their efforts to start this new segment .'
p7868
aS'i believe that our thoughts will enhance and strengthen the indo chinese relations in the times to come for the coming generations .'
p7869
aS'with this belief my best wishes to all of you once again .'
p7870
aS'thank you very much .'
p7871
aa(lp7872
S'excellency , prime minister chimad saikhanbileg , members of the cabinet , distinguished guests , this is a memorable day for india , for my delegation and me .'
p7873
aS'in less than 24 hours , we have experienced true friendship .'
p7874
aS'we have seen rare grace and generosity of a great people .'
p7875
aS'we have experienced the beauty of your land .'
p7876
aS'we have nurtured our spiritual links .'
p7877
aS'the visit to the ganden monastery will be a source of joy forever .'
p7878
aS'we have soaked in the richness of your culture at the mini-nadam festival .'
p7879
aS'we have seen the unity of spirit of our two nations and two people .'
p7880
aS'i have seen thousands of indians come together , when i have travelled to different cities .'
p7881
aS'for the first time , i have seen thousands of people of the host nation come together .'
p7882
aS'and , that too , for an event based on indias ancient tradition .'
p7883
aS'today , 1.'
p7884
aS'25 billion people of india and the world have come to see the strength and the spirit of our relationship .'
p7885
aS'ours is a relationship that is not measured on the scale of commerce or driven by competition against others .'
p7886
aS'it is a relationship of immeasurable positive energy that comes from our spiritual links and shared ideals .'
p7887
aS'it is the energy that seeks the well being of our two nations and the common good of the world .'
p7888
aS'this is a form of energy that has enormous power to be the force of peace , progress and prosperity in the world .'
p7889
aS'it is a force that can unite the world and direct our thoughts and efforts to the well being of the weak and the poor .'
p7890
aS'it can help preserve our beautiful planet .'
p7891
aS'the importance of a journey is not measured by the distance covered , but by the destination reached .'
p7892
aS'the visit may be short .'
p7893
aS'but , the outcomes are substantive and significant .'
p7894
aS'in the course of one day , we have imparted our ancient relations new strength and momentum .'
p7895
aS'our political understanding and commitment have become stronger .'
p7896
aS'our economic cooperation has scaled new heights .'
p7897
aS'our security cooperation has expanded .'
p7898
aS'the ties of hearts and minds have deepened .'
p7899
aS'excellency , all this would not have been possible without the great leaders of mongolia .'
p7900
aS'you have guided mongolia through the turbulence that comes from transitions in history .'
p7901
aS'you have chosen the path of democracy .'
p7902
aS'you have rekindled the spiritual heritage of your land .'
p7903
aS'you have guided mongolias international relationships with great wisdom .'
p7904
aS'excellency , your personal leadership and guidance for this visit has made it a big success .'
p7905
aS'your presence today at so many events added great sheen to them .'
p7906
aS'it spoke of the special bonds between our countries .'
p7907
aS'this is a bond that will be the eternal flame of light and hope for our people and our world .'
p7908
aS'so , as we celebrate 25 years of democracy in mongolia and 60 years of our diplomatic relations , we know that the best for relationship lies ahead of us .'
p7909
aS'with those words , let me raise a toast- to the health and well being of the prime minister of mongolia , his excellency , prime minister saikhanbileg- to the progress and prosperity of our spiritual neighbours of mongolia- to the everlasting friendship between the people of india and mongolia .'
p7910
aa(lp7911
S'your excellency president of mongolia , your excellency chairman of great hural of mongolia , your excellency prime minister of mongolia , honourable members of parliament , honourable members of diplomatic corp , i am delighted to visit mongolia , a country of great people .'
p7912
aS'your country reminds us how beautiful this world is .'
p7913
aS'it is truly a great honour to speak to the great hural .'
p7914
aS'it is a special privilege to do so in the 25th year of democracy in mongolia .'
p7915
aS'you are the new bright light of democracy in our world .'
p7916
aS'i am deeply grateful for your generosity in hosting me on a sunday .'
p7917
aS'i am humbled by the warmth of the welcome and your wonderful hospitality .'
p7918
aS'; everything that i see and experience here speaks clearly of unlimited goodwill for india .'
p7919
aS'i bring the greetings of your 1.'
p7920
aS'25 billion spiritual neighbours .'
p7921
aS'there is no higher form of a relationship ; no bonds more sacred than this .'
p7922
aS'we in india are honoured that you think of us this way .'
p7923
aS'as in the life of a human being , in the life of a nation , too , few things are as precious as the gift of friendship .'
p7924
aS'so , i speak for my entire nation to say that we deeply cherish the friendship of the mongol people .'
p7925
aS'india and mongolia are at an important milestone .'
p7926
aS'we are celebrating sixty years of diplomatic relations .'
p7927
aS'but , our ties are timeless in spirit .'
p7928
aS'around two thousand years ago , monks from india crossed difficult terrain and long distance to spread the message of lord buddha in this enchanting land .'
p7929
aS'many went from here to the hot tropics of india in search of spiritual knowledge .'
p7930
aS'centuries ago , when our horizons and our mobility were limited , the great mongols united asia and europe .'
p7931
aS'their stories of courage , daring and adventure continue to captivate human imagination around the world .'
p7932
aS'their impact on human history has been profound .'
p7933
aS'in the winding course of history , our own cultures , literature and art became interconnected .'
p7934
aS'and , it continues to shine in the richness of indias diversity and culture .'
p7935
aS'today indians and mongolians are telling the world that the bonds of hearts and minds have the strength to overcome the barriers of distance .'
p7936
aS'that bond thrives through the monks from mongolia who come to india each year for spiritual learning ; and , the hundreds of others who go there for education and training .'
p7937
aS'it lives through the work of kushok bakula rinpoche indias ambassador here from 1990 to 2000 .'
p7938
aS'the pethub monastery that he established here will be an enduring symbol of our links .'
p7939
aS'in the popularity of the yoga in mongolia , we see the unity of our spirit .'
p7940
aS'five decades ago , we stood firmly with you , as you sought membership of the united nations as a proud and sovereign nation .'
p7941
aS'in turn , time and again , you have stood in solidarity with us , in the united nations and elsewhere .'
p7942
aS'while the human bonds have been strong , our economic ties have been modest .'
p7943
aS'but , i have no doubt that our relations will progress along every avenue of the new age .'
p7944
aS'it will draw strength from indias economic growth .'
p7945
aS'a year ago , a nation of 1.'
p7946
aS'25 billion people voted for change and progress in the largest democratic election in human history .'
p7947
aS'we have worked with speed , resolve and ambition to fulfill our pledge .'
p7948
aS'in less than a year , our growth has rebounded to 7.'
p7949
aS'5 % .'
p7950
aS'india has emerged as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world .'
p7951
aS'and , we have the potential to grow even faster .'
p7952
aS'at a time when the global economy remains weak , the world speaks in one voice that india is the bright spot of hope to become the new locomotive for global economic momentum .'
p7953
aS'we are conscious that our challenges are vast across indias immense social and economic diversity .'
p7954
aS'but , we have faith in our sound policies and good governance .'
p7955
aS'we draw confidence from the unity of our nation and the common purpose of our people .'
p7956
aS'even more , we get our energy from the aspirations of a young india , with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years .'
p7957
aS'they are eager to pursue their dreams and confident in their ability to do so .'
p7958
aS'so , as we transform the lives of our people , we also create opportunities for the world .'
p7959
aS'and , we increase our ability to help our friends .'
p7960
aS'this is the urge of the land of buddha and gandhi .'
p7961
aS'this is the instinct born from our ancient belief in the world as one family .'
p7962
aS'as the indian economy adds strength to our region and the world , it will also benefit mongolia .'
p7963
aS'mongolias economic growth is also impressive .'
p7964
aS'so , our bilateral ties will also grow , despite the distance and demands of geography .'
p7965
aS'mongolias rich mineral resources can fuel our partnership .'
p7966
aS'and , i hope that location will not be a constraint on mongolias right to choose its partners .'
p7967
aS'we can seize the economic opportunities of the digital world and work together to make it more secure against growing cyber threats .'
p7968
aS'we can use indias expertise in dairy to launch a white revolution on these vast steppes .'
p7969
aS'we can work together to add value to mongolias pashmina resources right here .'
p7970
aS'we can create partnerships for affordable modern healthcare in mongolia .'
p7971
aS'we can use our heritage of traditional medicines to improve holistic treatment in our countries and abroad .'
p7972
aS'as indians travel abroad more , mongolia has the opportunity , with its natural and spiritual wealth , to become a major destination for them .'
p7973
aS'more than just trade and investment , our development partnership is a reflection of our shared ideals and vision .'
p7974
aS'i believe that the greatest form of this partnership is investment in the development of human resources and institutions .'
p7975
aS'this gives a nation its own capacity to shoulder the responsibility for its progress .'
p7976
aS'it enhances its independence of choice .'
p7977
aS'and , it makes progress more sustainable .'
p7978
aS'we remain deeply committed to this vision .'
p7979
aS'today , i will lay the foundation stone for the expansion and upgrading of the atal bihari vajpayee centre for excellence in information and communication technology .'
p7980
aS'under indias training programme , mongolia is one of our largest partners .'
p7981
aS'we will increase the itec training slots for mongolia from 150 to 200 .'
p7982
aS'we will also establish an india-mongolia joint school .'
p7983
aS'later today , i will hand over the bhabhatron equipment that can help treat cancer in mongolia .'
p7984
aS'this will be the first demonstration of our cooperation in the civil nuclear sector .'
p7985
aS'finally , today i conveyed to prime minister our decision to provide one billion u .'
p7986
aS's.'
p7987
aS'dollars line of credit to develop institutions , infrastructure and human resources in mongolia .'
p7988
aS'our security cooperation is growing .'
p7989
aS'we can learn a great deal from each other .'
p7990
aS'no one can doubt the well-known skills of mongols !'
p7991
aS'we are proud to conduct defence exercises together .'
p7992
aS'and , i am pleased that we have signed agreements today to cooperate more closely on border security and cyber security .'
p7993
aS'we have also agreed that india will help establish a cyber security centre in mongolias defence and security establishment .'
p7994
aS'but , the real strength of our relationship lies in the goodwill between our people and in the faith that unites us across the distances .'
p7995
aS'it is a power that can do more than just draw our two countries closer .'
p7996
aS'it can help advance peace , stability and prosperity in asia and the pacific region .'
p7997
aS'there was a time when the messengers of lord buddha linked asia with his message of love and compassion .'
p7998
aS'the shifting sands of time have not buried their footprints , because the value of their message never diminishes .'
p7999
aS'wherever i have travelled in asia - from the edge of pacific to the centre of the indian ocean ; from the sea shores of southeast asia to the lofty heights of the himalaya ; from the thick forests of the tropics to the expanse of these steppes - i see thriving monuments and temples dedicated to lord buddha .'
p8000
aS'the eight-fold path of lord buddha prescribes not just the path to happiness of individuals , but also a guide to the well being of societies and nations .'
p8001
aS'it is a message of kindness , love and compassion for all .'
p8002
aS'it is a lesson of deepest respect for human beings and human rights ; for faith in peace and non-violence .'
p8003
aS'this is a path that tells us to reach out to the weakest and the poorest in our societies .'
p8004
aS'it is a wisdom that sees the inter-dependence of all things in the universe and the virtue of simplicity .'
p8005
aS'therefore , it is a path to a more a sustainable planet .'
p8006
aS'it holds lessons for the world that is threatened by the excesses of consumption and disharmony between man and nature .'
p8007
aS'as in the prosperous west , asia of rising incomes and aspirations must remember and follow this message .'
p8008
aS'above all , it is a guide for a relationship of peace , equality , respect and cooperation between nations , small and large , weak and powerful .'
p8009
aS'it is a call for each of us , as individuals and as nations , to assume the universal responsibility to mankind and our planet .'
p8010
aS'it inspires us to think of common good of all nations .'
p8011
aS'the teachings of lord buddha are reflected in the principles of democracy .'
p8012
aS'the path of righteousness is based on freedom of mind , liberty of thought , liberty of action and liberty of speech .'
p8013
aS'these are the foundations of democracy .'
p8014
aS'it is defined by recognition of inter-dependence , acceptance of diversity and belief in co- existence .'
p8015
aS'its essence is the freedom of human beings , faith in dialogue , rule of law , and resolution of differences through peaceful means .'
p8016
aS'so , if we follow the right path of the master , it will also be natural to walk on the path of democratic values .'
p8017
aS'here , in mongolia , we see the union of these two ideals .'
p8018
aS'i say this to asia : whatever forms of government each nation chooses , however we define ourselves as a state , we can still apply the principles of democracy in our engagement with each other .'
p8019
aS'whatever path we have chosen , whatever be the history of our disputes , or the nature of our claims , we are linked by the common spiritual heritage across a vast arc of asia .'
p8020
aS'the convergence of buddhism and democracy provides us a path to build an asia of peace and cooperation , harmony and equality .'
p8021
aS'this is a region that has woken up to its destiny .'
p8022
aS'no region in the world has seen so much progress in the last half century as asia .'
p8023
aS'no age has seen transformation on such scale in one generation as our continent .'
p8024
aS'this is a region of ancient wisdom and youthful dynamism it is a continent that is expected to lead the world in the 21st century .'
p8025
aS'yet , this is also a ; region that lives on the uneasy edge of uncertainty , of unsettled questions , of unresolved disputes and unforgotten memories .'
p8026
aS'across asias diversity , we also see growing disparity of hope and opportunities .'
p8027
aS'asia has given much to the world through the ages .'
p8028
aS'it now has the responsibility to shape its future .'
p8029
aS'so , now more than our own requirements , i am sure we will be able to do the requirements that asia wants from us and the world thinks about us .'
p8030
aS'and i am sure that with our spiritual background , and our extraordinary quality of the mind , we can serve the world and society .'
p8031
aS'and i am sure that the path of righteousness is paved with the freedom of mind , liberty and thought .'
p8032
aS'i am sure that whatever we have decided , and in this widening course of history , our own cultures , literature and art become interconnected and it continues to sign in the richness of indias diversity and culture .'
p8033
aS'today indians and mongolians are telling the world that the bonds of hearts and minds have the strength to overcome the barriers of distances .'
p8034
aS'this is a token of our reverence for our shared spiritual heritage and respect for our friendship .'
p8035
aS'as the sapling grows , it will be an emblem of our growing partnership .'
p8036
aS'in time , it should also become a symbol of humanism in the world and conservation of our planet .'
p8037
aS'i thank you once again .'
p8038
aS'thank you .'
p8039
aS'may happiness be bestowed on all .'
p8040
aS'when i entered the parliament , i saw its symbol , i found a special connection with this parliament .'
p8041
aS'the symbol is a lotus .'
p8042
aS'you will be happy to know that my partys symbol is also lotus .'
p8043
aS'so it is a very special connection with you .'

p8155
aS'they are outstanding leaders of asia .'
p8156
aS'they reflect asias diversity , and its common spirit .'
p8157
aS'i am delighted to visit republic of korea in the first year of my government .'
p8158
aS'long before korean brands had found their way into indian homes , koreans had found their way into indian hearts .'
p8159
aS'nearly a hundred years ago , indias great poet , rabindranath tagore called korea the lamp of the east .'
p8160
aS'today , korea is proving him right .'
p8161
aS'koreas economic miracle and global leadership in technology has made the promise of the asian century more real .'
p8162
aS'korea is a pillar of democracy and a force of stability in asia and pacific .'
p8163
aS'asias re-emergence is the greatest phenomenon of our era .'
p8164
aS'it started in japan and then extended to china , korea and southeast asian nations .'
p8165
aS'in the west , nations like qatar are transforming their desert landscapes into booming economies .'
p8166
aS'it is now indias turn to sustain asias success .'
p8167
aS'it is a nation of 1.'
p8168
aS'25 billion people blessed with the extraordinary resources in the form of 800 million youth .'
p8169
aS'indias potential has never been in doubt .'
p8170
aS'and , in the course of the past year , we are translating promise into a reality ; hope into confidence .'
p8171
aS'indias growth has rebounded to 7.'
p8172
aS'5 % per year ; and , the prospects of further increase are strong .'
p8173
aS'the world speaks in one voice that india is the new bright spot of hope for our region and the world .'
p8174
aS'the progress of one-sixth of humanity will also be an opportunity for the world .'
p8175
aS'it will also give india the capacity to do more for our world .'
p8176
aS'above all , indias progress will be an asian success story .'
p8177
aS'and , it will help make our asian dream a bigger reality .'
p8178
aS'this is because asia will succeed more when all of asia rises together .'
p8179
aS'asia must not have two faces one of hope and prosperity ; the other of want and despair .'
p8180
aS'it must not be a continent of nations on the rise and others in decline ; of regions with stability and others with broken institutions .'
p8181
aS'india seeks an asia of shared prosperity , where the success of one nation becomes the strength of the other .'
p8182
aS'growth must be more inclusive within and across nations .'
p8183
aS'this is the obligation of national governments , but also a regional responsibility .'
p8184
aS'that is why the future i dream for india is also the future i want for our neighbours .'
p8185
aS'as some of us in asia become more prosperous , we must be prepared to share our resources and markets with those who need them .'
p8186
aS'i am pleased to see many in asia assume that responsibility .'
p8187
aS'this is the principle that guides indias policies .'
p8188
aS'and , it comes from our timeless belief in the world as one family vasudhaiva kutumbakam we must also empower our youth with skills and education , so that they can look to the future with hope .'
p8189
aS'over the next 40 years , three billion asians will lift themselves into a higher level of prosperity .'
p8190
aS'asias prosperity and rising population will place a huge demand on our limited resources .'
p8191
aS'so , our footprint on earth must become lighter as our economic weight increases .'
p8192
aS'that is why i have often called for a change in lifestyle and new pathways to prosperity .'
p8193
aS'and , i believe it is possible , without compromising our future .'
p8194
aS'asia must also use its capacity for innovation and frugal manufacturing for affordable renewable energy .'
p8195
aS'reverence for nature is part of our shared heritage .'
p8196
aS'combating climate change is in our enlightened self-interest .'
p8197
aS'that is why india has set a goal of 175 giga watts of new renewable energy capacity over the next five years .'
p8198
aS'but , coal and oil will remain the key source of energy for all of us for a long time to come .'
p8199
aS'so , let us work together to make them cleaner and less harmful for nature .'
p8200
aS'our vision of inclusive growth will be incomplete unless we pool our innovation and technologies to transform our regions agriculture .'
p8201
aS'many of us have similar ecosystems and rural economies .'
p8202
aS'and , we have a long history of learning from each other .'
p8203
aS'by 2025 , a majority of asians will live in cities .'
p8204
aS'many urban clusters in asia will exceed the population of mid-sized countries elsewhere in the world .'
p8205
aS'by then , by some estimates , india will host around 11 % of the global urban population .'
p8206
aS'so , creating livable and sustainable cities of tomorrow should be our collective goal .'
p8207
aS'that is why in india , i have placed so much emphasis on urban renewal and smart cities .'
p8208
aS'and , there is much that we can learn from cities like seoul .'
p8209
aS'if asia must rise as one , asia should no longer think of itself in regional fragments .'
p8210
aS'today , what happens in west asia has a strong impact on east asia .'
p8211
aS'and what happens on the oceans will have influence on the asian highlands .'
p8212
aS'india is located at asias crossroads .'
p8213
aS'and , we will assume our responsibility to build an inter-connected asia .'
p8214
aS'we must connect our regions through infrastructure and integrate them through trade and investments .'
p8215
aS'we must also do everything possible to secure lasting peace and stability for asia .'
p8216
aS'this year , as we observe the 100th and 70th anniversary of the two wars , we should remember that peace is not inevitable .'
p8217
aS'we must build institutions that promote cooperation on the principles of equality , co-existence and international rules and norms .'
p8218
aS'this will also mean that we work together to safeguard our commons for the benefit of all our oceans , outer space and the cyber space .'
p8219
aS'this is a responsibility of each nation towards one another .'
p8220
aS'it is also our collective task against our common challenges terrorism ; trans-national crimes ; natural disasters ; and , diseases .'
p8221
aS'asia of dynamism , but also of uncertainties must lead in shaping its course .'
p8222
aS'but , asia of growing weight will also have to take greater responsibility for the world .'
p8223
aS'and , it must also seek a larger role in global affairs .'
p8224
aS'we must work as asians to reform the global institutions of governance , including the united nations and its security council .'
p8225
aS'asia of rivalries will hold us back .'
p8226
aS'asia of unity will shape the world .'
p8227
aS'in conclusion , i wish to say this .'
p8228
aS'through its history , asia has been linked by the flow of religions , culture , knowledge and trade .'
p8229
aS'and , asia has also given much to the world great religions , our staples such as tea and rice , some of the finest human creations , and some of the most significant inventions and technologies .'
p8230
aS'we have risen from tragic conflicts and the long shadow of colonialism .'
p8231
aS'we have also seen asias strength and spirit .'
p8232
aS'let us now draw upon our heritage and synergies , our ancient wisdom and youthful energy , to pursue a common purpose .'
p8233
aS'for ourselves and the world .'
p8234

p8263
aS'this is a relationship of great importance for us and our region .'
p8264
aS'the visit is at a historic moment .'
p8265
aS'we have resolved a question that has lingered since independence .'
p8266
aS'our two nations have a settled boundary .'
p8267
aS'it will make our borders more secure and peoples life there more stable .'
p8268
aS'our parliaments approval of land boundary agreement reflects the consensus in india on relations with bangladesh .'
p8269
aS'we accepted the settlement of the maritime boundary last year .'
p8270
aS'it is evidence of the maturity of our ties and our shared commitment to international rules .'
p8271

p8366
aa(lp8367
S'namaskar , my dear countrymen !'
p8368
aS'last time in mann ki baat i had requested you to send me memorable pictures if you go out on a vacation anywhere in india and if you happen to find them , kindly post them under the incredible india hashtag .'
p8369
aS'when isaid that , i had never imagined that it would get such an immense response .'
p8370
aS'lakhs of people have posted photos on twitter , facebook and instagram .'
p8371
aS'i can say that india is full of diversities and i was able to witness so many magnificent scenes in those pictures ; be it of architecture , art , nature , waterfalls , mountains , rivers or seas .'
p8372
aS'government of india had never thought that in terms of tourism you all could contribute in such a massive way .'
p8373
aS'i liked some pictures so much that i re-tweeted them .'
p8374
aS'and as i understand , if some one would not have posted the picture of belum caves in andhra pradesh many people would have never come to know that something like that exists in our country .'
p8375
aS'madhya pradeshs orcha fort is another example of that .'
p8376
aS'we assume rajasthan to be a state with scarcity of water , but when someone sends a photo of menal waterfall , it is a matter of great surprise .'
p8377
aS'really , a tremendous work has been done .'
p8378
aS'we will promote and also continue doing such work and the entire world will watch it , entire nation will watch it and our new generation will also watch it .'
p8379
aS'my beloved countrymen , though you have elected me as the prime minister of the country but at times , the human in me shuns all posts and prestige associated with it and submerges oneself within it .'
p8380
aS'i can say that 21st june , the international yoga day affected me in the same manner .'
p8381
aS'at that time , when i proposed the international yoga day , it was just an idea .'
p8382
aS'but the scene that was witnessed on 21st june was such that wherever the sun dawned , wherever its rays reached , there was not a single landmass wherein it was not welcomed by way of yoga .'
p8383
aS'we can say with conviction that the sun never sets in the world of yoga practitioners .'
p8384
aS'the way yoga was received and was welcomed with open arms around the world , there would not be any indian who would not be proud of it .'
p8385
aS'i too got delighted .'
p8386
aS'and when the people of france chose river seine and eiffel tower in which they take pride to do yoga , they gave an equal status to it as river siene and eifel tower .'
p8387
aS'in new york people did yoga at times square .'
p8388
aS'if we think about sydney , australia then the picture of opera house comes to our mind .'
p8389
aS'the citizens of australia gave equal respect to yoga and did yoga at the opera house .'
p8390
aS'whether it is north america , silicon valley or milans duomo cathedral it is a matter of great pride for us .'
p8391
aS'on 21st june when i saw mr ban ki-moon , un secretary general doing yoga at un headquarters , i was really delighted .'
p8392
aS'similarly , un peace keeping force did a spectacular display of yoga .'
p8393
aS'in india , our soldiers too were doing yoga in siachen on white sheet of snow and on sea too , wherever our naval ships are posted , the yoga program was being carried out by indian navy .'
p8394
aS'delhi made it to the guinness book of world records .'
p8395
aS'rajpath turned into the yogpath that day .'
p8396
aS'i am thankful to india and the rest of the world and can say that the international yoga day was not for namesake .'
p8397
aS'it seemed as if that from every corner of the world , there was a new inquisitiveness , new joy , new hope and new connection .'
p8398
aS'few days back , when i tweeted a photo of a vietnamese child doing yoga , it was such a sweet photo that it got a lot of attention from the entire world .'
p8399
aS'everybody , be it men-women , old-young , village-city , developed or developing countries , everybody got connected with it .'
p8400
aS'yoga in true terms , became the core reason to connect the entire world .'
p8401
aS'i do not know how the intellectual class , elites of the world would analyze this event .'
p8402
aS'but i can feel and every indian can experience that the whole world is very curious to know more about india .'
p8403
aS'curiosity towards india has increased .'
p8404
aS'the world wants to know about the values , the rituals and the heritage of india .'
p8405
aS'it is our responsibility that without any artificiality we share our legacy and introduce ourselves to the world .'
p8406
aS'we can only do this when we ourselves are proud of our traditions .'
p8407
aS'at times , we are so familiar with our values that we dont feel there is anything new in them but we ourselves do not know that our family values are considered to be a big thing in the entire world .'
p8408
aS'why dont we familiarize the outside world with our family values ?'
p8409
aS'the world would be very surprised to know about them .'
p8410
aS'i am sure , they would be intrigued .'
p8411
aS'there are many things that our forefathers have given to us which are the best and the entire world also has the right on those things .'
p8412
aS'the success of international yoga day has brought in a new responsibility along with it .'
p8413
aS'it is our responsibility that we gift supreme yoga teachers to the world .'
p8414
aS'it is our responsibility that we can see the entire tradition of yoga on one platform from the universe .'
p8415
aS'i request the youngsters , especially the it professionals , that all of you should come together to create an online yoga activity program .'
p8416
aS'we all should come to know about all the yoga organizations , yoga teachers and all the necessary information about the yoga from this online program .'
p8417
aS'one database must be prepared and i believe you can do it .'
p8418
aS'one must start from somewhere and it would surely turn out to be a great power .'
p8419
aS'i have seen and learnt from the perspective of recent occurrences that a government that works and the government that is action-oriented can bring in results if the targets are set .'
p8420
aS'we should not forget that the only voice that could be heard one year ago was that nothing happens , nothing happens , nothing happens .'
p8421
aS'can you imagine that there is a department under government named ayush .'
p8422
aS'nobody has paid attention towards this department .'
p8423
aS'the only mention ayush in some corner of the newspaper being a small department is once in 2 to 5 years .'
p8424
aS'but it led on the international yoga day .'
p8425
aS'it was this small department that organized this event in the entire world .'
p8426
aS'therefore , this is an example that if there is an aim then even a small department can do a supreme job .'
p8427
aS'in the last few days , the world saw how we saved people from yemen to afghanistan .'
p8428
aS'in a few hours- , we reached nepal and helped people over there .'
p8429
aS'when people wanted to open an bank account under the governments new scheme of jan dhan yojana , how the people working in bank helped them to do so and connected millions of indians to the bank .'
p8430
aS'on 15th august last year , when i appealed from the red fort for toilets in schools , i had said that by next 15th august we have to complete this task .'
p8431
aS'the work which could not be completed in last 60 years was promised to be completed by the end of one year .'
p8432
aS'the promise was really daring .'
p8433
aS'almost four and half lakh toilets were to be built but i can say it with satisfaction that though 15th august is still far off , the work of constructing toilets by the people is on the verge of completion .'
p8434
aS'this means that the government , people and government workers , all want to work for the country .'
p8435
aS'if we pledge to work in an unselfish manner welfare for all , happiness for all then the government will also work efficiently .'
p8436
aS'the people who are a part of the government will also work efficiently and the people of the nation will welcome them with open arms .'
p8437
aS'i have experienced this .'
p8438
aS'this is the true strength that drives a nation forward .'
p8439
aS'last month , we had launched three insurance schemes .'
p8440
aS'i had launched them from kolkata and it has received such a commendable response in such a short span of time .'
p8441
aS'there have been very few steps which have been taken from the perspective of social security but by way of these three schemes we are taking a big leap .'
p8442
aS'in such a short time span more than 10 crore people have become a part of these schemes but we have to take it further .'
p8443
aS'i have a thought which i want to put forth before you .'
p8444
aS'rakshabandhan comes in the month of august .'
p8445
aS'cant we start a massive movement before this festival and make every women , be it our mother or sister , a part of this , thereby giving benefit to them under this insurance program .'
p8446
aS'be it a sister who is a domestic help in your home or your own sister why cant we gift them a rs .'
p8447
aS'12 or rs .'
p8448
aS'330 scheme on rakshabandhan for their entire life .'
p8449
aS'this can be a big gift for a sister from their brother .'
p8450
aS'why cant we set the eve of rakshabandhan as a target and in a number of 2 crore , 5 crore , 7 crore and 10 crore try to reach the sisters so that they can reap the benefit of this scheme .'
p8451
aS'lets come together and try to work together towards the completion of this pledge .'
p8452
aS'whenever i hold a mann ki baat session , many people send me suggestions .'
p8453
aS'this time many people have suggested that i say something about the monsoons .'
p8454
aS'yogesh dandekar from nagpur , harshvardhan ji from mysore , praveen nadkarni ji , divyanshu gupta ji have all asked me to say something about the monsoon in this session of mann ki baat .'
p8455
aS'they have sent in some really good suggestions .'
p8456
aS'and this is a season of happiness .'
p8457
aS'and each one of us , whatever the age is definitely tempted to enjoy the first showers of the monsoon .'
p8458
aS'i am sure , you too might be enjoying the rains with bhajiyas , pakoras , corn and a hot cup of tea .'
p8459
aS'just as the rays of the sun give us life , similarly rainfall provide us life and sustenance .'
p8460
aS'every drop of water is precious .'
p8461
aS'as a responsible citizen and as a member of the society , we will have to cultivate the habit of conserving every drop of water .'
p8462
aS'it should be our pledge that water from the villages stays in the villages and water for the cities remains available for them .'
p8463
aS'if the rain water does not flow away , it goes into the earth , then the aquifers get recharged and the year long water woes get resolved .'
p8464
aS'rain water harvesting is not a new concept .'
p8465
aS'it is being practiced over the centuries .'
p8466
aS'be it check dams , watershed development , small lakes or the small ponds in fields , we need to save the precious waters everywhere .'
p8467
aS'i always tell people , that if you go to porbander , the birth place of mahatma gandhi , you will be able to see a two hundred year old underground water tank which got directly recharged with the rain water .'
p8468
aS'you can still see it .'
p8469
aS'if you ever go there , do visit the place .'
p8470
aS'and you will find that even after two hundred years it is still functional , brimming with water and the water does not even stagnate .'
p8471
aS'porbander is a coastal city , so potable water was collected through the rains for the entire year .'
p8472
aS'even in those times such a lot of care was taken .'
p8473
aS'we can too do the same .'
p8474
aS'this should in fact become a mass movement .'
p8475
aS'each and every village should have the facilities for rain water harvesting .'
p8476
aS'similarly , we find greenery so pleasing to our eyes .'
p8477
aS'we all like greener surroundings .'
p8478
aS'gardens and trees bring in an element of freshness in our lives .'
p8479
aS'this monsoon season , there should be mass plant sowing campaigns conducted by youth and social organizations .'
p8480
aS'and i can take a leaf from my personal experience and offer you a suggestion which has been very successful .'
p8481
aS'this is an intensely rural technology .'
p8482
aS'whenever you sow a plant , place an earthen pot near it .'
p8483
aS'you just need to fill it once or twice in a month .'
p8484
aS'you will see how fast the plant grows into a lush green tree .'
p8485
aS'i have even been telling the farmers to plant trees on the boundaries of their fields instead of putting barricades .'
p8486
aS'these will become your biggest asset in the long run .'
p8487
aS'it is true that rains are enjoyable and bring in a lot of fun at the same time .'
p8488
aS'it is also true that rains also bring in many diseases .'
p8489
aS'doctors get to see so many patients that they hardly get the time to breathe .'
p8490
aS'we all know that rains cause many water borne diseases .'
p8491
aS'increased moisture in the environment leads to bacterial growth and so , keeping the environment clean becomes important .'
p8492
aS'cleanliness is very important in monsoons .'
p8493
aS'it is often requested to consume safe drinking water .'
p8494
aS'most of the people boil and drink water during this season .'
p8495
aS'it has its own benefits .'
p8496
aS'and this is true that the more care we take , healthier we would be .'
p8497
aS'we need monsoons and we need water but we also need to stay healthy .'
p8498
aS'dear citizens , we have recently launched three schemes for the people in the cities .'
p8499
aS'we have around 500 small cities .'
p8500
aS'our policy is waste to wealth .'
p8501
aS'we can earn from waste too .'
p8502
aS'garbage can be recycled to make fertilizers , bricks and even electricity .'
p8503
aS'contaminated water can be recycled to make it clent and be used for irrigation in the fields .'
p8504
aS'we have to take this movement forward .'
p8505
aS'in the amrut scheme , we have launched a massive campaign and taken up initiatives to improve the quality of life in our cities .'
p8506
aS'we should become a country which is able to match the living standards of the world .'
p8507
aS'we should have smart cities , comparable to world standards .'
p8508
aS'and yet at the same time , the poorest of poor person should have an accommodation of his own and that too complete with water , electricity , sanitation and access to a school .'
p8509
aS'in 2022 when india celebrates its 75 years of independence , we wish that every indian has a house of his own .'
p8510
aS'keeping all this in mind , we have launched three major schemes .'
p8511
aS'i am positive that these schemes will bring about a qualitative difference in the lives of the urban people .'
p8512
aS'i am myself connected to you via the social media .'
p8513
aS'i keep getting many new suggestions and new ideas and also good and bad information about our government .'
p8514
aS'and sometimes it so happens that a small comment from an individual in some remote village in india conveys something that just touches our hearts .'
p8515
aS'you are aware that the government has launched beti bachao beti padhao programme .'
p8516
aS'but you cant imagine the force that is lent to the programme when a village or a society adopts it .'
p8517
aS'a few days back a sarpanch in a small remote village of haryana , sri sunil jaglan ji launched selfie with daughter campaign .'
p8518
aS'such an environment was created that every father wished to click a selfie of himself with his daughter and post it on the social media .'
p8519
aS'i liked this idea , and that too for a special reason .'
p8520
aS'in haryana , the number of girls in comparison to boys is dismally low .'
p8521
aS'around another 100 districts in the country have a similar dismal situation of skewed sex ratio .'
p8522
aS'but it is the worst in haryana .'
p8523
aS'in that very same haryana , if a sarpanch of a small indistinct village lends this meaning to the beti bachao beti padhao programme , then i certainly get overwhelmed .'
p8524
aS'it makes me so happy and it gives me a new hope and i do express my happiness .'
p8525
aS'i request you all to take a selfie with your daughter and post it on # selfie with daughter .'
p8526
aS'and do not forget to post a tagline around the theme of beti bachao beti padhao with it , whatever be the language it can be in hindi , english , your mother tongue or your native language .'
p8527
aS'and i promise to re-tweet the most inspirational tagline with you and your daughters selfie .'
p8528
aS'we can turn beti bachao beti padhao into a mass movement .'
p8529
aS'i urge you all to take forward the programme launched by sri sunil in bibipur village of haryana .'
p8530
aS'i request you all to post on # selfie with daughter .'
p8531
aS'lets us all enjoy the rising honour and prestige of our daughters and see how joyful this entire experience of beti bachao beti padhao becomes .'
p8532
aS'let us all rid ourselves of this bad name that we have for not respecting our daughters .'
p8533
aS'so my best wishes to you for the coming monsoon season .'
p8534
aS'may all of you enjoy the rains .'
p8535
aS'make our country clean and green .'
p8536
aS'and remember , the international yoga day was not a single day initiative .'
p8537
aS'continue practicing yoga , then see what difference it makes to you and your life .'
p8538
aS'and i say this from my experience .'
p8539
aS'please take this forward .'
p8540
aS'make yoga a part of your life .'
p8541
aS'and that initiative regarding incredible india , do keep posting a picture of whichever part of the country you go to .'
p8542
aS'the country and the world will awaken to our diversity .'
p8543
aS'i felt that the handicrafts did not receive due attention .'
p8544
aS'do make it a point to post the handicrafts of the local region you visit .'
p8545
aS'there are so many things that people around you might be making , the poor as well as the skilled might be creating .'
p8546
aS'do keep posting their pictures regularly .'
p8547
aS'we have to expand our reach to the world and make india known to the world .'
p8548
aS'we have an easy medium at our disposal and so we will all do it .'
p8549
aS'my dear countrymen , that is all for today .'
p8550
aS'i shall meet you again in the next edition of mann ki baat .'
p8551
aS'many people expect me to announce some huge schemes during this programme .'
p8552
aS'but i am working day and night towards those .'
p8553
aS'this is my time for some light conversation with you all .'
p8554
aS'this gives me immense pleasure .'
p8555
aS'thank you very much !'
p8556
aa(lp8557
S'his excellency president islam karimov , president of uzbekistan , members of the media , i am delighted to be in the historic and beautiful city of tashkent .'
p8558

p8559
aS'i thank president karimov and the people of uzbekistan for their very warm welcome and hospitality .'
p8560
aS'it is a pleasure to meet president karimov .'
p8561
aS'he has led with great vision and wisdom to steer uzbekistans progress and advance peace and prosperity in the region .'

aS'today , i have embarked on a five-nation tour of central asia .'
p8563
aS'it reflects our resolve to start a new era in our relations with central asian republics .'
p8564
aS'our relationship with the region has ancient roots and has left a strong imprint on both .'
p8565
aS'it now occupies a significant place in indias future .'
p8566
aS'i have begun my journey in uzbekistan .'
p8567
aS'this underlines this nations importance for india , not just in the context of this region , but also more broadly in asia .'
p8568
aS'in recent years , india and uzbekistan have built a strategic partnership on the foundation of mutual respect and shared interests .'
p8569

p8570

p8580
aS'i briefed him about the international north south transport corridor and proposed that uzbekistan consider becoming a member .'

p8582
aS'i am pleased with the agreements in the areas of culture and tourism , because they will bring our people closer .'
p8583
aS'few countries can match uzbekistan in nurturing hindi and indian culture .'
p8584
aS'tomorrow , i look forward to meeting a vibrant group of indologists and hindi linguists .'
p8585
aS'india will expand cooperation in capacity building through increase in the number of training offers in india .'

p8595
aS'we are thankful to the people of tashkent and uzbekistan , for preserving the legacy of our former prime minister .'
p8596
aS'this has been a very rewarding visit .'
p8597
aS'it has sown the seeds of a rich harvest in the years ahead .'
p8598
aS'i look forward to the opportunity of receiving president karimov in india .'
p8599

p8601
aa(lp8602
S'prime minister karim mossimov , mr shigeo katsu , president of the university , students and eminent guests .'
p8603
aS'i am delighted to be here .'
p8604
aS'mr .'
p8605
aS'prime minister , i am deeply honoured that you have joined us today .'
p8606
aS'you are a person of learning and many talents .'
p8607
aS'i learnt today that your skills in hindi and yoga are among them .'
p8608
aS'it is a great privilege to embark on a journey of all five nations of central asia .'
p8609
aS'this might be the first time this has happened .'
p8610
aS'i am truly excited to visit a great country and a great region that has been called the pivot of human history .'
p8611
aS'it is a land of beauty and cultural splendor , of outstanding achievements and great heroism .'
p8612
aS'it is also a region of continuous engagement with india since human civilisation began .'
p8613
aS'so , i have come here , drawn by history and goodwill and as a neighbour , to write a new chapter in an ancient relationship .'
p8614
aS'tonight , as i speak to the people of central asia , i could not have a chosen a better venue than the nazarbayev university .'
p8615
aS'in its short life , it has emerged as an excellent centre of education .'
p8616
aS'and , i congratulate the first batch that has graduated this year .'
p8617
aS'the university reflects the vision of president nazarbayev that education is the foundation of a nations progress and leadership .'
p8618
aS'it recalls the wisdom of the great kazakh writer , abai kunanbaev , who spoke about education as the shield and pillar for kazakh people .'
p8619
aS'today , kazakhstan is a nation of global stature and respect .'
p8620
aS'this is not just because mother nature has been generous to you with resources of every kind .'
p8621
aS'it is because of your investment in education , human resources and infrastructure .'
p8622
aS'these have helped increase the size of the economy four times in the last ten years .'
p8623
aS'it is because of your leadership in advancing peace and cooperation in the great eurasian region .'
p8624
aS'it is your vision that has given us the conference on interaction and confidence building in asia .'
p8625
aS'kazakhstan is a voice of responsibility and maturity in international forums , including the united nations .'
p8626
aS'no indian will forget kazakhstans generosity in making way for indias bid for the membership of the un security council in 2011-12 .'
p8627
aS'we stand solidly behind you for your bid in 2017-18 .'
p8628
aS'like kazakhstan , the rest of central asia is on the rise .'
p8629
aS'it is just over two decades since nations here gained independence and regained their identity .'
p8630
aS'the countries of central asia are endowed with rich human and natural resources .'
p8631
aS'i am coming from tashkent .'
p8632
aS'uzbekistan is experiencing rapid economic growth and progress .'
p8633
aS'turkemistan , tajikistan and kyrgystan are turning their resources into a promise of a more prosperous future .'
p8634
aS'you have built modern , inclusive and pluralist nations at a time when many in the region are caught in conflict and instability .'
p8635
aS'your success is as important for the region as it is for the world .'
p8636
aS'central asia is at the crossroads of eurasia .'
p8637
aS'it has been caught in the currents of history and it has also shaped it .'
p8638
aS'it has seen rise and fall of empires .'
p8639
aS'it has witnessed trade thrive and ebb .'
p8640
aS'for monks , merchants and monarchs , it has been both - a destination and a passage .'
p8641
aS'it has been an intermediary of cultures and faiths from across asia .'
p8642
aS'your gifts to human civilisation have been rich .'
p8643
aS'your imprint on human progress has been lasting .'
p8644
aS'and , over the last two thousand years and more , india and central asia have influenced each other profoundly .'
p8645
aS'for centuries , buddhism flourished in this part of the world and even influenced buddhist art in india .'
p8646
aS'through here , it spread eastward .'
p8647
aS'as i stood in the gandan monastery in mongolia this may , i marveled at that journey of faith that linked asia across its daunting landscape .'
p8648
aS'the confluence of indian and islamic civilisations took place in central asia .'
p8649
aS'we enriched each other not only in spiritual thought , but also in medicine , science , mathematics and astronomy .'
p8650
aS'the islamic heritage of both india and central asia is defined by the highest ideals of islam knowledge , piety , compassion and welfare .'
p8651
aS'this is a heritage founded on the principle of love and devotion .'
p8652
aS'and , it has always rejected the forces of extremism .'
p8653
aS'today , this is an important source of strength that brings india and central asia together .'
p8654
aS'the richness of our ties is written into the contours of our cities and our daily lives .'
p8655
aS'we see this in architecture and art , handicraft and textile and in most popular food .'
p8656
aS'the dargahs of delhi resonate with sufi music that draws people from all faiths .'
p8657
aS'the cities of central asia have become centres of yoga and hindi , long before the world came together to celebrate the international day of yoga on 21st june .'
p8658
aS'uzbekistan has recently completed fifty years of radio broadcast in hindi .'
p8659
aS'our epics ramayana and mahabharata were popular on uzbek tv as they were in india .'
p8660
aS'many of you wait for the release of the latest bollywood film with the same excitement as people in india .'
p8661
aS'this is the source of goodwill between our people .'
p8662
aS'it is the foundation of a relationship of hearts and emotions .'
p8663
aS'and , it can not be measured only by the scale of trade or the demands of states .'
p8664
aS'it was evident when president nazarbayev and the leaders of other central asian republics came to india soon after their nations independence .'
p8665
aS'since then , our political engagement has deepened .'
p8666
aS'our defence and security cooperation is growing .'
p8667
aS'trade is expanding , but it is still modest .'
p8668
aS'our cooperation in energy sector has begun .'
p8669
aS'later today , we will launch the drilling of the first oil well with indian investments in kazakhstan .'
p8670
aS'indian investments in central asia have started flowing in .'
p8671
aS'and , so have indian tourists in growing numbers .'
p8672
aS'more than 50 flights a week connect the five central asian capitals to india .'
p8673
aS'and , it takes about the same time as it would take to fly to chennai from delhi .'
p8674
aS'our strongest progress is in human resource development .'
p8675
aS'thousands of professionals and students from central asia have trained in india .'
p8676
aS'many from india come to the universities in the region .'
p8677
aS'we have established centres of excellence in information and communication technology in the region .'
p8678
aS'and , we are also pleased that we have three indian cultural centres in the region .'
p8679
aS'yet , we will be the first to say that the engagement between india and central asia falls short of its promise and potential .'
p8680
aS'we have a special place in our hearts for each other .'
p8681
aS'but , we have not paid as much attention to each other as we should .'
p8682
aS'this will change .'
p8683
aS'that is why i am travelling to all five countries in the region in the early stages of my government .'
p8684
aS'both india and central asia can not achieve their full potential without each other .'
p8685
aS'nor will our people be safer and our region more stable without our cooperation .'
p8686
aS'india constitutes one-sixth of humanity .'
p8687
aS'it is a nation of 800 million youth that is an enormous force of progress and change for india and the world .'
p8688
aS'our economy is growing at 7.'
p8689
aS'5 % every year .'
p8690
aS'we can sustain higher growth rates long into the future .'
p8691
aS'india is the new frontier of opportunities for the world .'
p8692
aS'central asia is a vast region of immense resources , talented people , rapid growth and a strategic location .'
p8693
aS'so , i am here to start a new era in our relationship with central asia .'
p8694
aS'india is prepared to invest more in a new partnership of prosperity .'
p8695
aS'we will work together not just in minerals and energy , but in industries such as pharmaceuticals , textiles , engineering and small and medium enterprises .'
p8696
aS'we can invest in refineries , petrochemicals and fertilizer plants here .'
p8697
aS'we can harness our strength in information and communication technology to create wealth and opportunities for our youth .'
p8698
aS'today , i will inaugurate a centre of excellence in astana with a super computer from india .'
p8699
aS'we can use the reach of space technology for closer partnership in development and resource management .'
p8700
aS'i also see vast opportunities in areas like agriculture and dairy .'
p8701
aS'we can renew our old ties in traditional medicines .'
p8702
aS'central asia is a natural destination for the indian tourists .'
p8703
aS'we are intensifying our exchanges in culture , education and research .'
p8704
aS'and we will connect our youth more .'
p8705
aS'in this troubled world , we must also strengthen our defence and security cooperation to defend our values , our nations security and our regions peace .'
p8706
aS'we live at the frontier of instability .'
p8707
aS'we live close to the crucible of extremism and terrorism .'
p8708
aS'we see terrorism spawned by nations and groups .'
p8709
aS'today , we also see cyber space become a platform without borders for terror to draw recruits to its cause .'
p8710
aS'from theatres of conflicts to the calm neighbourhoods of distant cities , terrorism has become a global challenge as never before .'
p8711
aS'it is a force that is larger and more enduring than its changing names , locations and targets .'
p8712
aS'so , we must ask ourselves : will we let a generation of youth be lost to guns and hate , because they will hold us accountable for their lost future ?'
p8713
aS'so , during this visit , we will strengthen our defence and security cooperation in the region .'
p8714
aS'but , we will also combat terrorism by the strength of our values and our commitment to humanism .'
p8715
aS'this is a responsibility that india and central asian nations owe to our shared inheritance and to the future of our region .'
p8716
aS'our shared values and aspirations are also the foundation of closer international partnership , including in the united nations .'
p8717
aS'but , in a transformed world , we also see the growing institutional erosion of the united nations .'
p8718
aS'as nations that are committed to international order , we must work to make it relevant to our times .'
p8719
aS'so , as the united nations turns 70 , we should press for reforms of the united nations , especially its security council .'
p8720
aS'indias membership of shanghai cooperation organisation will deepen our regional partnership .'
p8721
aS'and we have begun a study on a free trade agreement with the eurasian economic union for deeper integration with this region .'
p8722
aS'this is an era in which space and cyber are making roads and rails less relevant .'
p8723
aS'but , we will also restore our physical connectivity for trade , transit and energy .'
p8724
aS'the international north south transport corridor opens a competitive and quick route for india to eurasia .'
p8725
aS'and , i hope all of central asia will join it .'
p8726
aS'we hope to join the ashgabat agreement on trade and transit .'
p8727
aS'indias investment in chahbahar port in iran will bring us closer to central asia .'
p8728
aS'i also hope that we can restore the traditional route to central asia through pakistan and afghanistan .'
p8729
aS'we can draw confidence from the agreement between turkmenistan , afghanistan , pakistan and india on the gas pipeline .'
p8730
aS'this region has prospered the most when we have been connected .'
p8731
aS'indeed , our hopes of an asian century will be realized , when we see asia as one - not as south , west , east or central .'
p8732
aS'asia will rise when we all prosper together .'
p8733
aS'for that , we must connect asias different parts .'
p8734
aS'india is at the crossroads of asias land and sea routes .'
p8735
aS'we understand our responsibility .'
p8736
aS'and , we are working with a sense of priority to connect ourselves to the east and the west , by land and sea .'
p8737
aS'there is a surge of interest in reconnecting asia with itself and beyond .'
p8738
aS'our former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee ji called for a new silk route initiative here in 2002 .'
p8739
aS'today , all of asia seeks the revival of the glorious ancient silk road .'
p8740
aS'but , we must also remember the lessons of history .'
p8741
aS'the silk road flourished and waned with the fortunes of central asia .'
p8742
aS'the end of the silk road did not just come about from the rise of sea-based trade of the new european powers .'
p8743
aS'it also happened because central asia was no longer a bridge between regions , but the new fault line between great empires to the east , west and south ; when it was no longer the hub of trade , but a land in the shadows of the high walls of the powers around it .'
p8744
aS'central asian nations declined and trade withered .'
p8745
aS'the success of connectivity through and across central asia is important .'
p8746
aS'for that , the great nations of central asia must flourish and regain their central role in eurasia .'
p8747
aS'from europe to asia , all nations must foster a climate of cooperation and collaboration , not competition and exclusion , in this region .'
p8748
aS'the region must remain stable and peaceful , free from conflict and the violence of extremism and terrorism .'
p8749
aS'and , as central asia links the east and the west , it must also connect to the south .'
p8750
aS'for that is how it always was .'
p8751
aS'in an age of globalization , asia can not remain fragmented .'
p8752
aS'and , central asia can not remain distant and disconnected from india .'
p8753
aS'i am confident that we can make it happen .'
p8754
aS'our ancestors crossed the mighty himalaya , karakoram , hindu kush and pamirs for spiritualism , knowledge , and markets .'
p8755
aS'we will all work together to build the silk route of the 21st century .'
p8756
aS'we will connect through space and cyber as we will by air , land and sea .'
p8757
aS'let me conclude with a few lines from abduraheim otkur , a poet of this region .'
p8758
aS'he said : our tracks remain , our dreams remain , everything remains , far away , yet even if the wind blows , or the sand shift , they will never be covered , our tracks , and the caravan will never stop along the way , though our horses are very thin ; one way or another , these tracks will be found someday , by our grandchildren ; or our great grandchildren .'
p8759
aS'i say this to you : india and central asia will redeem that promise .'
p8760
aS'thank you .'
p8761
aa(lp8762
S'his excellency president nursultan nazarbayev , members of the media , am delighted to visit this beautiful country .'

p8768
aS'you have put kazakhstan on the path of rapid progress .'

p8771
aS'i also learnt that this beautiful new capital is still celebrating astana day .'
p8772
aS'so , this is really a good time to visit kazakhstan .'
p8773
aS'last evening i spoke about my vision for indias relations with central asia .'
p8774
aS'kazakhstan will play a critical role in advancing this vision .'
p8775
aS'we greatly value our relationship with kazakhstan .'
p8776
aS'we have enormous synergies of markets , resources and skills for a strong bilateral relationship .'
p8777
aS'we discovered remarkable convergence in our economic policies , approaches and strategies in a number of areas .'
p8778
aS'we have shared perspectives on many international issues , including regional peace , connectivity and integration ; reforms in the united nations ; and , combating terrorism .'
p8779
aS'kazakhstan is our biggest economic partner in the region .'
p8780
aS'but , our relations are modest , compared to our potential .'
p8781
aS'we will work together to take economic ties to a new level .'
p8782
aS'kazaksthan was one of the first countries with which we launched civil nuclear cooperation through a uranium purchase contract .'
p8783
aS'we are pleased to have a much larger second contract now .'
p8784
aS'we intend to expand cooperation in other minerals , as well .'
p8785
aS'hydrocarbons is another area of high priority for us .'
p8786
aS'last evening , we launched the drilling operations for exploration in the first oil field with indian investments in kazakhstan .'
p8787
aS'i am pleased that president nazarbayev responded positively to my request to consider additional mature blocks for indian investments .'
p8788
aS'we will also give priority to investment in both directions in manufacturing and infrastructure .'
p8789
aS'i was very encouraged by the interaction at the business roundtable yesterday that i chaired with prime minister massimov .'
p8790
aS'we expect a new roadmap for cooperation from the joint business council of our chambers of commerce and industry .'
p8791
aS'kazakhstans green bridge vision is similar to indias ambitious plan of adding 175 gw of renewable energy in the next seven years .'
p8792
aS'this is another priority area of cooperation , including in the manufacture of equipment .'
p8793
aS'in adddition , india will participate on a large scale in the expo 2017 in astana .'
p8794
aS'we will also enhance cooperation in space and information technology , including their application for governance and development .'
p8795
aS'we both agree that connectivity is an important issue , but one that we will address .'
p8796
aS'the international north south transport corridor , the iran-turkmenistan-kazakhstan rail link , indias interest in joining the ashkabat agreement on trade and transit and indias investment in chahbahar port in iran will strengthen connectivity .'
p8797
aS'the joint study group on indias proposal for a free trade agreement with eurasian economic union is a step towards our closer economic integration .'
p8798
aS'development of human resources is a priority for both countries .'
p8799
aS'yesterday , i inaugurated the india-kazakhstan centre of excellence in information & communication technologies at the eurasian national university .'
p8800
aS'we are pleased to have contributed a super computer from india .'
p8801
aS'consistent with our focus on youth , we have launched a new youth exchange programme with six kazakh universities for the next five years .'
p8802
aS'our defence and security cooperation is an important dimension of our strategic partnership .'
p8803
aS'we both want to make it stronger , including in defence manufacturing .'
p8804
aS'we welcome the new memorandum of understanding on defence cooperation .'
p8805
aS'president and i agreed on the pressing need for reforms of the united nations and its security council .'
p8806
aS'i thank him for kazakhstans continued support for indias candidature for a permanent seat in a reformed united nations security council and for a un comprehensive convention on international terrorism .'
p8807
aS'i reiterated indias support for kazakhstans candidature for a non-permanent seat in the unsc for 2017-18 .'
p8808
aS'i am also grateful to him and the people of kzakhstan for the support in making the international day of yoga on june 21st a huge global success mr president , thank you for a very productive and pleasant visit .'
p8809
aS'i feel that this visit has opened the door to a much broader and deeper relationship , including many new areas of productive cooperation .'

p8815

p8821
aS'it is a strong foundation of close relations between our two countries .'
p8822
aS'india attaches great importance to this relationship .'
p8823
aS'there is enormous potential for cooperation between india , a nation of 1.'
p8824
aS'25 billion people with a large and rapidly growing economy , and turkmenistan , a nation rich in resources .'
p8825
aS'as india deepens its relations with central asia , turkmenistan will play a crucial role in it .'
p8826
aS'we have shared interests in a peaceful and stable afghanistan and central asia .'
p8827
aS'we also have common purpose in combating terrorism and extremism in our region .'
p8828
aS'connecting south and central asia will open up new economic opportunities in our region and beyond .'
p8829
aS'i thank mr president for sharing this vision and for his strong support to the relationship .'
p8830
aS'the most significant initiative in our relationship is the tapi gas pipeline .'

p8832
aS'we welcomed the agreements between the four countries for the pipeline .'

p8839
aS'connectivity is an area of priority for both countries .'
p8840
aS'if we use the iran route , ashgabat is the first capital we would reach in central asia .'
p8841
aS'we are grateful for turkmenistans support to india joining the ashgabat agreement on trade and transit .'
p8842
aS'i have also proposed that turkmenistan becomes a member of the international north south transport corridor .'

aS'it is a beautiful country .'
p8867

aS'tajikistan is nearest to india among all central asian countries .'

aS'it is a strong pillar of our strategic partnership .'
p8887
aS'we are both located in the proximity of the main source of terrorism .'
p8888

p8905
aa(lp8906
S'my dear countrymen , namaskar !'
p8907
aS'this year the rains have started on a good note .'
p8908
aS'this will definitely prove beneficial to our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing of kharif crops .'
p8909
aS'i am very pleased to share an immensely good news with you all .'
p8910
aS'we have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country .'
p8911
aS'poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food .'
p8912
aS'the good news for me is that there has been an increase of approximately 50 % in the production of pulses and anincrease of around 33 % in the production of oilseeds .'
p8913
aS'i would especially like to congratulate and compliment all my farmer brothers and sisters for this achievement .'
p8914
aS'my dear countrymen , 26th july is marked as kargil vijay diwas in the history of our country .'
p8915
aS'the intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land , our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree .'
p8916
aS'during the kargil war , each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies .'
p8917
aS'i would like to salute all our brave soldiers who thwarted the attempts by our enemies without caring for their lives .'
p8918
aS'kargil war was not limited to justour borders , but each of our cities , villages contributed in this war .'
p8919
aS'this war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border .'
p8920
aS'this war was also fought by the daughters of our country , who were newly married and their henna were still fresh on their hands .'
p8921
aS'also , by the proud fathers , who saw themselves as soldiers , seeing their sons fighting for the country , and also by that infant who had not even learnt to walkcatching his fathers fingers .'
p8922
aS'it is because of these unmatchable sacrifices that our country is proudly standing on its feet in front of the entire world .'
p8923
aS'hence , i would like to salute all these valiant warriors on this occasion of kargil vijay diwas .'
p8924
aS'there is another reason why i consider 26th july quite important because mygov .'
p8925
aS'in was launched a few months after our government was formed .'
p8926
aS'our pledge was to promote citizen participation in democracy and connect every citizen in the development work .'
p8927
aS'and today i am pleased to share this after one year that nearly two crore people have visited mygov website .'
p8928
aS'we have received comments from five and a half lac people and i am extremely glad to mention that more than fiftythousand people took out time from their precious schedule to apply their mind and provide their suggestions on pmo applications as they considered this work important .'
p8929
aS'and we have received quite significant suggestions .'
p8930
aS'one of the suggestions sent from mr akhilesh vajpayee from kanpur is to provide separate quota to the disabled for booking tickets on irctc website .'
p8931
aS'it is quite unfair that the disabled citizens have to go through the same tiring procedure and buy tickets atthe railway station .'
p8932
aS'though this is a very minor issue but the government never took note of it or thought about the same previously .'
p8933
aS'but on the suggestion of our brother akhilesh vajpayee , our government looked into this suggestion seriously and we have implemented this facility in our system for our disabled brothers and sisters .'
p8934
aS'we are receiving quite positive suggestions on mygov , it is helping in getting assistance in creating logos , tag-lines and formulating policies byyourselves .'
p8935
aS'we are experiencing fresh air in the administrative system .'
p8936
aS'we are experiencing a new sense of consciousness .'
p8937
aS'i am even receiving suggestion on mygov that what should be my speech on 15th of august .'
p8938
aS'we have received quite a few suggestions from suchitra raghavachari from chennai in this regard .'
p8939
aS'she has suggested me to speak on the topics like save our daughters , educate a girl child , clean ganges , swachh bharat .'
p8940
aS'with this i got an idea and i am requesting you all to send suggestions about what should be the topics for my 15th august speech .'
p8941
aS'you can send in your suggestions through mygov , letters to radio or write letters to the pms office .'
p8942
aS'look , i believe that this will be a greatinitiative to include peoples suggestion in framing my speech for 15th august .'
p8943
aS'i believe that you will send your good suggestions .'
p8944
aS'i would like to talk about an issue which is a matter of great concern .'
p8945
aS'i neither want to sermonize nor i am trying to find an escape route towards my responsibilities pertaining to state government , central government or units of local self-government institutions .'
p8946
aS'two days ago a visual of an accident in delhi caught my attention , wherein the victim on scooter was fighting for his life for ten minutes post the accident .'
p8947
aS'he did not receive any help from the passers-by .'
p8948
aS'in general also i have noticed that i have been receiving suggestions to speak on road safety and make the people aware of this .'
p8949
aS'be it hoshakote akshay from bengaluru , ameya joshi from pune or prasanna kakunje from mudbidri , karnataka all these all people have writtento me there are many other names which i am not being able to mention and have raised their concerns .'
p8950
aS'i agree that whatever you have put forth is valid .'
p8951
aS'my heart shivers when i look at the statistics of accidents .'
p8952
aS'we are witnessing an accident every minute in our country .'
p8953
aS'due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country .'
p8954
aS'it is a matter of huge concern that out of these deaths , nearly one third of the victims comprise the youth ranging from 15 to 25 years of age group , and such death shakes the very foundation of an entire family .'
p8955
aS'the government system will continue to work towards this but iwould like to request all the parents to make their children aware of all the safety rules pertaining to driving a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler the families should encourage discussion of road safety at home and create an atmosphere about the same to promote road safety .'
p8956
aS'we have seen few lines written at the back of auto-rickshaws , papa , come home early and after reading it we are so touched by it .'
p8957
aS'and therefore i say that the government has taken a lot of new initiativesin this regard , be it the initiative of education on road safety , initiative related to road engineering or of enforcement of road safety laws and the discussion on emergency care to be provided post accidents .'
p8958
aS'we are going to implement road transport and safety bill to adopt these safety measures in our country .'
p8959
aS'in the coming days , we are also planning to take many important measures for implementing national road safety policy and road safety action plan .'
p8960
aS'we have undertaken another project called cashless treatment in gurgaon , jaipur and vadodara to mumbai , ranchi , rangaon and mundiya national highway and it will be further extended .'
p8961
aS'the cashless treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post-accident one need worry if one has money or not , who will pay the bills , leaving all this worry one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospitalfacilities at the earliest .'
p8962
aS'we have started a toll-free number 1033 for providing information about incidents across the country and ambulance service but all these are services are for post accidents .'
p8963
aS'one must strive to avoid accidents first but it is also important for us to see from the perspective that each and every soul , each and every life is precious .'
p8964
aS'sometimes i say that the government employees to be karma yogis or selfless workers .'
p8965
aS'i recalled a few incidents in the last few days which i liked and hence would like to share with you .'
p8966
aS'sometimes people get tired of their continuous jobs .'
p8967
aS'in the initial few years the attitude is okay , i get my salary so i will work .'
p8968
aS'however , i came across an incident of a railway department a few days ago , wherein a railway tte vijay biswal from nagpur division who is gifted with painting prowesscould have has chosen to showcase his skills related to any field but he continues to work with the railways and paints various scenes related to railways only .'
p8969
aS'through this he gets an inner satisfaction for his job and also enjoys his hobby at the same time .'
p8970
aS'using his example , we can learn how to bring more life to our own jobs .'
p8971
aS'vijay biswal has shown us how we can connect our jobs with our hobbies , interests or skills .'
p8972
aS'who knows , vijay biswals work may get recognised by hispaintings across the nation in the near future .'
p8973
aS'i have come to know about a very inspiring work started by the entire team of government officials in harda district , madhya pradesh .'
p8974
aS'these bunch of officials with their entire team have started such a work which has touched me immensely and i really liked it and the work they have started is operation malyuddh , and upon hearing this you will feel that this subject will go in a certain direction .'
p8975
aS'but the key focus of this operation is to give a new direction to swachh bharatabhiyaan .'
p8976
aS'they are working on brother number one operation in which the best brother has to gift one toilet to his sister .'
p8977
aS'on the occasion of raksha bandhan , they are influencing all the brothers to gift toilet to their sisters , so that all the mothers and sisters of the district avoid going to toilet in the open .'
p8978
aS'this operation has given a new meaning to raksha bandhan and i would like to congratulate the entire government team of harda district for this initiative .'
p8979
aS'i came across a news a few days back and these small news really gives me immense pleasure and i would like to share the same with you .'
p8980
aS'there exists a small village called keshla in rajnandgaon , chhattisgarh .'
p8981
aS'the inhabitants of this village from last few months tried and lead a campaign for building toilets in the village .'
p8982
aS'now , nobody from this village has to go to toilet in the open .'
p8983
aS'after the completion of this campaign , the entire village celebrated this accomplishment just like amega festival .'
p8984
aS'these finest examples coming up to me show how our society is bringing change in human values and human mind and how the citizens of this country are taking the nation forward .'
p8985
aS'bhavesh deka from guwahati has written to me on the north-east related issues and problems .'
p8986
aS'i must say that north-east people are quite active .'
p8987
aS'i really appreciate that they write about a lot of issues .'
p8988
aS'i would like to tell them with great pleasure that we have a separate ministry for north-eastern region .'
p8989
aS'during the government of atal bihari vajpayee as our prime minister , a doner ministry called development of north-east region was formed .'
p8990
aS'after our government was formed , thedoner department took an important decision of not staying in delhi and working from centre for the north-east regions ?'
p8991
aS'instead it was decided to send the government officials and their team on a seven days camp to north-east states like nagaland , arunachal pradesh , tripura , assam and sikkim .'
p8992
aS'these officials would visit the districts , villages and meet the local government officials and talk to peoples representatives and the citizens of those regions .'
p8993
aS'they will listen to theirproblems and direct the government in taking appropriate measures in solving those problems .'
p8994
aS'this initiative will bring a fruitful result in the near future .'
p8995
aS'the officials who will visit these states would realize the beauty of these states and will feel very determined to work for the development of these states and to fix the problems of these states .'
p8996
aS'when they return with this pledge , they can easily understand the problems of these states even when they reach delhi .'
p8997
aS'this is a greatinitiative to go far-off from delhi to east , and this act is called act east policy .'
p8998
aS'my dear countrymen , we are extremely delighted and proud of the mars mission success .'
p8999
aS'indias pslv c-28 has launched five uk satellites , which are the heaviest satellites launched by india till date .'
p9000
aS'such news remain in the flashlight for few moments and are gone .'
p9001
aS'we often do not remember these achievements for a long time .'
p9002
aS'i am often worried by this thought that we speak to the youth of our nation and ask about their dream job , only one out of 100 would express theirinterest in becoming a scientist .'
p9003
aS'youth is losing their interest in science , which is a matter of great concern .'
p9004
aS'science and technology is a type of dna for development .'
p9005
aS'the youth of our country should dream about becoming a scientist and imbibe interests in the field of research and innovation .'
p9006
aS'their capabilities should be monitored and must be assisted in the right direction to achieve success in this field .'
p9007
aS'ministry of human resource development , govt .'
p9008
aS'of india has initiated a national discovery campaign .'
p9009
aS'it was inaugurated by indias ex-president dr.'
p9010

aS'j abdul kalam .'
p9013
aS'asa part of this campaign , iit , nit , central and state universities being their mentor and guide are going to educate and motivate the aspiring students to choose the right path in their career .'
p9014
aS'i always press upon the ias officers of our government , who have reached such heights with their vast intellect and education that they should visit the nearby schools and colleges and share their knowledge for just two to four hours in a week .'
p9015
aS'your experience and intellect would certainly helpthe new generation to some extent .'
p9016
aS'we have raised a very big issue regarding the supply of 24 hours electricity in the villages of our country .'
p9017
aS'this work is difficult but it must be done .'
p9018
aS'we have auspiciously inaugurated this scheme and the villages will get a supply of 24 hours electricity in the coming years .'
p9019
aS'the students of the villages should not be affected with the shortage of electricity during their exams .'
p9020
aS'there should be enough electricity for starting a small industry .'
p9021
aS'today , the villagers have to go to othervillagers for charging their mobile phones .'
p9022
aS'the villages should be provided with all the facilities that are available in the cities .'
p9023
aS'for this purpose , we have launched deendayal upadhyaya gram jyoti programme .'
p9024
aS'i am aware that this country is quite vast and we have to reach the villages and far off corners of the country .'
p9025
aS'we have to run for the development of the poor .'
p9026
aS'we will achieve this goal and it is already in progress .'
p9027
aS'we will certainly achieve this .'
p9028
aS'today , through mann ki baat , i felt like expressing these myriad of thoughts .'
p9029

aa(lp9036
S'shri rajnath singhji , home minister shri muivah and all senior leaders of the national socialist council of nagaland .'
p9037
aS'my warm greetings to all those present here today on this historic occasion !'
p9038
aS'i wish that shri isak swu , who played a leading role in reaching this agreement , was present today .'
p9039
aS'he could not be here because of poor health .'
p9040
aS'i wish him speedy recovery .'
p9041
aS'just as his contribution to this agreement has been huge , his guidance will remain crucial in the times ahead .'
p9042
aS'the naga political issue had lingered for six decades , taking a huge toll on generations of our people .'
p9043
aS'i sincerely thank shri isak swu , shri muivah and other naga leaders for their wisdom and courage , for their efforts and cooperation , which has resulted in this historic agreement .'
p9044
aS'i have the deepest admiration for the great naga people for their extraordinary support to the peace efforts .'
p9045
aS'i compliment the national socialist council of nagaland for maintaining the ceasefire agreement for nearly two decades , with a sense of honour that defines the great naga people .'
p9046
aS'my relationship with the north east has been deep .'
p9047
aS'i have travelled to nagaland on many occasions .'
p9048
aS'i have been deeply impressed by the rich and diverse culture and the unique way of life of the naga people .'
p9049
aS'it makes not only our nation , but also the world a more beautiful place .'
p9050
aS'the naga courage and commitment are legendary .'
p9051
aS'equally , they represent the highest levels of humanism .'
p9052
aS'their system of village administration and grass-root democracy should be an inspiration for the rest of the country .'
p9053
aS'the respect for the infirm and elders , the status of women in society , sensitivity to mother nature , and the emphasis on social equality is a natural way of naga life .'
p9054
aS'these are values that should constitute the foundation of the society that we all seek .'
p9055
aS'unfortunately , the naga problem has taken so long to resolve because we did not understand each other .'
p9056
aS'it is a legacy of the british rule .'
p9057
aS'the colonial rulers had , by design , kept the nagas isolated and insulated .'
p9058
aS'they propagated terrible myths about nagas in the rest of the country .'
p9059
aS'they deliberately suppressed the reality that the nagas were an extremely evolved society .'
p9060
aS'they also spread negative ideas about the rest of india amongst naga people .'
p9061
aS'this was part of the well known policyof divide and rule of the colonial rulers .'
p9062
aS'it is one of the tragedies of independent india that we have lived with this legacy .'
p9063
aS'there were not many like mahatma gandhi , who loved the naga people and was sensitive to their sentiments .'
p9064
aS'we have continued to look at each other through the prism of false perceptions and old prejudices .'
p9065
aS'the result was that connectivity between nagaland and the rest of india remained weak across this divide .'
p9066
aS'economic development and progress in nagaland remained modest ; and , durable peace was elusive .'
p9067
aS'since becoming prime minister last year , peace , security and economic transformation of north east has been amongst my highest priorities .'
p9068
aS'it is also at the heart of my foreign policy , especially the act east policy .'
p9069
aS'i have been deeply concerned about resolving the naga issue .'
p9070
aS'soon after entering office , i appointed an interlocutor for talks with the naga leaders , who not only understood the naga people as also their aspirations and expectations , but has great affection and respect for them .'
p9071
aS'given the importance of this initiative , i asked my office to supervise these talks ; and i personally kept in touch with the progress .'
p9072
aS'i want to especially thank my senior colleague , home minister shri rajnath singhji , whose support and advice was invaluable in bringing us here today .'
p9073
aS'todays agreement is a shining example of what we can achieve when we deal with each other in a spirit of equality and respect , trust and confidence ; when we seek to understand concerns and try to address aspirations ; when we leave the path of dispute and take the high road of dialogue .'
p9074
aS'it is a lesson and an inspiration in our troubled world .'
p9075
aS'today , we mark not merely the end of a problem , but the beginning of a new future .'
p9076
aS'we will not only try to heal wounds and resolve problems , but also be your partner as you restore your pride and prestige .'
p9077
aS'today , to the leaders and the people of nagaland , i say this : you will not only build a bright future for nagaland , but your talents , traditions and efforts will also contribute to making the nation stronger , more secure , more inclusive and more prosperous .'
p9078
aS'you are also the guardians of our eastern frontiers and our gateway to the world beyond .'
p9079
aS'equally , the rest of the nation will join you in shaping a future of dignity , opportunity and prosperity for the naga people .'
p9080
aS'today , as you begin a new glorious chapter with a sense of pride , self-confidence and self-respect , i join the nation in saluting you and conveying our good wishes to the naga people .'
p9081
aS'thank you .'

p9085
aS'we are happy that india is his first destination in asia .'
p9086
aS'the visit is special because this is the 40th anniversary year of independence of mozambique and the 40th anniversary year of the establishment of our diplomatic relations .'
p9087
aS'africa and the indian ocean are among the highest priorities for our foreign policy .'
p9088
aS'mozambique is crucial for both .'
p9089
aS'mozambique and india have centuries-old trade ties .'
p9090
aS'20,000 people of indian origin in mozambique are an important link between us .'
p9091
aS'our colonial experiences and development aspirations have shaped a shared vision and a strong partnership .'
p9092
aS'mozambique can be a large and a proximate source of natural gas , coal and other minerals that are so important to drive our growth .'
p9093
aS'it also offers huge opportunities in agriculture sector .'
p9094
aS'i am pleased that indian investments in these sectors have grown significantly in recent years .'
p9095
aS'mozambique hosts nearly 25 % of indian investments in africa .'
p9096

aa(lp9129
S'prime minister : my beloved 125 crore countrymen of india , my best wishes and heartiest greetings on the occasion of this sacred festival of our freedom .'
p9130
aS'this morning of the 15th of august is not a usual morning .'
p9131
aS'this is the dawn of the freedom-festival of the greatest democracy of the world .'
p9132
aS'this dawn is also the dawn of the dreams of the one hundred twenty five crore indian citizens .'
p9133
aS'this dawn also heralds the resolve of 125 crore people of india .'
p9134
aS'on this pious occasion i also extend my many many salutations to all those greatpersons of india who sacrificed their lives and led a life of penance while making persistent efforts to fight for the honour of the country .'
p9135
aS'they even spent their youth in the prison , went through all kinds of sufferings ; but never gave up their dreams and resolve to see india free .'
p9136
aS'recently many distinguished citizens of india , youths , literary artists and social workers- sons and daughters of mother india- have achieved many great feats to make our country proud .'
p9137
aS'they are countless in number and from the ramparts of red fort i extend my best wishes and greetings to all of them from the core of my heart .'
p9138
aS'the vastness and the diversity of india is always talked about , but our india has many other great characteristics as well , there is a lot of diversity in india .'
p9139
aS'india is a large country .'
p9140
aS'and there is simplicity among the people of india .'
p9141
aS'there is unity running through all the parts of the country and that is what is our strength ; the strength of our nation .'
p9142
aS'strength of our country has been sustained over centuries together .'
p9143
aS'every era has seen the attempts to boost it further .'
p9144
aS'theyhave been moulded according to the requirements of realising the dreams for the future , they have been nurtured and it is due to that only that this country has reached this far with our age old traditions and ever new resolves .'
p9145
aS'our unity , simplicity , fraternity , harmony are our biggest strength .'
p9146
aS'this strength should never be blemished , it should never be hit .'
p9147
aS'if the unity of the country gets disturbed , the dreams also get shattered , therefore , whether it is the poison of casteism , communal fanaticism , we dont have to allow it in any form whatsoever , not allow it to take root , and then we have to cure the poison of casteism , the fanaticism of communalism with the nectar of development , distribute the flow of the nectar of development and through the flow of this nectar attempt bringing about a new awareness .'
p9148
aS"dear brothers and sisters , this country is moving ahead because of the  team india '' and this  team india '' is a big team of our one twenty five crore countrymen ."
p9149
aS'the world might never have thought about the team of one twenty five crore citizens working as a team together as to how they take the nation to new heights , build the nation and also protect it !'
p9150
aS"so , whatever we are doing and wherever we are trying to reach , it is all because of the  team india '' and we are grateful to this '' team india '' ."
p9151
aS'peoples participation is the biggest strength of democracy .'
p9152
aS'if we run the country through the participation of one hundred and twenty five crore indians , our country will be moving ahead one hundred and twenty five crore steps every moment .'
p9153
aS"that is why we have encouraged this peoples participation as  team india '' ."
p9154
aS"we have given priority to  team india '' ."
p9155
aS'through electronic platform mygov .'
p9156
aS'in , through lacs of letters of the countrymen , through my mann ki baat , throughdialogues with citizens , this peoples participation is on the rise day by day .'
p9157
aS"about every affair of the government we receive a number of suggestions from the far flung villages of our country and this is the real strength of our  team india '' ."
p9158
aS"my dear fellow citizens , this is a fact that there is only one mandate of this  team india '' and that is all our schemes , all our systems should benefit the poor of the country ."
p9159
aS'we should support the poor in their fight against poverty and empower them in this arduous effort of theirs because no one wants to remain poor and they also wish to get rid of poverty .'
p9160
aS'hence the meaningfulness of our resources , our schemes and our programmes is in their usefulness to the cause ofwelfare of the poor .'
p9161
aS'brothers and sisters , last year on the occasion of 15th of august , i had expressed some of my views before you .'
p9162
aS'at that time i was new , whatever i saw in the government , i expressed them with an open mind before one hundred and twenty five crore citizens .'
p9163
aS"today after one year , standing under the tricolor from the same ramparts of the red fort , i assure the countrymen that in this period of one year our  team india '' , consisting of one hundred and twenty five crore people , iscommitted to realize our dreams within the timeframe with new hope , new energy and utmost hard work ."
p9164
aS'an atmosphere of trust has emerged .'
p9165
aS'i had announced pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna on the last 15th of august .'
p9166
aS'even after sixty years of independence ; even when the banks were nationalized for the poor , 40 % people of the country were without a bank account till the last 15th of august ; the doors of the banks were not open for the poor .'
p9167
aS'we resolved that we would erase this blot andwould provide a solid base to the financial inclusion which is talked about the world over , by integrating the poorest of the poor to the mainstream economic activities ; and this is only the beginning .'
p9168
aS'we had decided that unlike the previous work culture of talking in terms of uncertain time frames , we will complete the work by the 26th of january as the country celebrates the next republic day .'
p9169
aS'my countrymen , today i can proudly say that we achieved that target within the time frame .'
p9170
aS'17 crore people opened their bank accounts under pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna .'
p9171
aS'with a view to extend opportunities to the poor , we had said that these bank accounts could be opened with zero balance .'
p9172
aS'we had even said that we would bear the operational costs of the bank .'
p9173
aS'after all , what for the banks exist ?'
p9174
aS'they should be for the poor and thats why we had decided to open accounts with zerobalance .'
p9175
aS'we have seen the rich of our country ; however , this time around we have also seen our poor and seen their wealth .'
p9176
aS'from the ramparts of the red fort , let me salute and bow to the large-heartedness of these poor ; because even if there was a provision of opening the account with zero balance , these poor people have deposited twenty thousand crore rupees in their bank accounts .'
p9177
aS'it could be possible only due to richness of our poor citizens .'
p9178
aS"and hence , today my conviction bearsproof that it is all because of the spirit of these poor that this  team india '' will march ahead ."
p9179
aS'brothers and sisters , if the branch of a bank is opened or a building of the bank is constructed in a certain part of our country , it becomes the hot topic of discussion , people rejoice , it is hailed as a mark of great development and remarkable progress .'
p9180
aS'this is so because in the past 60 years , we have measured the development of the country only on the basis of these parameters .'
p9181
aS'this has been the yardstick that if any branch of a bank is opened somewhere , it elicits lotsof accolades and praises , the government receives much adulation , but my dear fellow citizens , it is not a challenging task to open a branch of a bank .'
p9182
aS'this task can easily be accomplished through the government exchequer , but to bring 17 crore countrymen to the doorstep of the bank is an arduous task , it takes a lot of hard work , you have to give your heart and soul to accomplish this task , you are required to be ever vigilant .'
p9183
aS"and here i would extend my heartfeltcongratulations to various banks and their employees who have been a very significant part of  team india '' ."
p9184
aS'i congratulate them for making banks so easily accessible to the poor and this fact will bring a major change in the coming days .'
p9185
aS'among the global economic schools of thought , there is also the one which maintains that financial inclusion doesnt always bring positive results and due to that the system has to bear the pressure of poverty .'
p9186
aS'i disagree with this thought .'
p9187
aS'in a country like india , if we look at the pyramid of development , its base is the broadest .'
p9188
aS'if it be firm , the entire pyramid of development tends to be strong .'
p9189
aS'today the downtrodden , the exploited , oppressed , deprived , and the ignored ones ofour country form the base of the pyramid of development .'
p9190
aS'we have to strengthen the foundation of this pyramid of development so as to ensure that these people are empowered through financial inclusion and this pyramid of development remains unshakable .'
p9191
aS'it would stand firm amid any crisis and if this pyramid of development is based on economic strength , it would increase the purchasing power of these people to a great extent .'
p9192
aS'and when the purchasing power of the poorest ofthe poor in the society increases , nobody can stop that economy to flourish and move ahead .'
p9193
aS'it takes the country swiftly to the newer heights of development and therefore it is our intention to give impetus to that .'
p9194
aS'we have laid great stress upon social security and also the welfare of the poor - and thus prime ministers suraksha bima yojana , atal pension yojana and prime ministers jeevan jyoti bima yojana have been launched .'
p9195
aS'crores of the people of our country have nosocial security cover .'
p9196
aS'leave the poor aside , benefit of insurance has not reached even the lower middle class .'
p9197
aS'so we made a plan - just pay one rupee per month , not more , that is just rs .'
p9198
aS'12 per annum and be entitled to the benefits of pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojana .'
p9199
aS'if your family faces any calamity then they will receive 2 lac rupees .'
p9200
aS'we know how to manage an economy !'
p9201
aS'thats why we launched prime ministers jeevan jyoti bima yojana for 90 paisa a day , even less than 1 rupee .'
p9202
aS'so itis rs .'
p9203
aS'330 annually for the health of ones family - and for the security of ones family- insurance of 2 lac rupees .'
p9204
aS'this is what we have done .'
p9205
aS'brothers and sisters , schemes have been made in the past also .'
p9206
aS'there is no government which doesnt make schemes .'
p9207
aS'every government does that .'
p9208
aS'there is no government which doesnt make announcements .'
p9209
aS'every government does that .'
p9210
aS'there is no government which doesnt light the inauguration lamps , doesnt cut ribbons -- every government does that .'
p9211
aS'but the touchstone is whether we walk the talk or not .'
p9212
aS'we have laid a great stress upon a new work culture .'
p9213
aS'dear countrymen , our nation has manyschemes which are 40 years old or 50years old but these schemes could not reach more than 5 or 7 crore people .'
p9214
aS'this scheme has just completed a hundred days , 100 days !'
p9215
aS'i mean it , and in these hundred days ten crore citizens have been benefited 10 crore people !'
p9216
aS'ten crore citizens of this country means ten crore families .'
p9217
aS'and this means that out of total 30-35 crore families of our country , ten crore families have joined this scheme within a span of hundred days .'
p9218
aS"brothers and sisters , the uniqueness of our government , of  team india '' , during last one year , especially the great strength and the biggest achievement of  team india '' , consisting of one hundred and twenty five crore people has been to fulfill the tasks within the set time frame ."
p9219
aS'last year i referred to toilet facilities for all from this red fort , i also referred to cleanliness .'
p9220
aS'it sounded strange to the whole country for a few hours as to what sort of prime minister is this !'
p9221
aS"but today in all the surveys that has been carried out in the entire country , this point has come out in all of them that if there is something that is the most important factor of  team india '' and that has touched every person , is the movement towards cleanliness ."
p9222
aS"brothers and sisters , we used to invoke the people of the society and marked the names of various people to promote the  cleanliness drive '' ."
p9223
aS"that was such a period , but today i have to congratulate this  team india '' ."
p9224
aS'people from all walks of life whether they are celebrities , diplomats , social workers , educationists , community leaders or spiritual leaders or our friends from media , all of them have taken a major responsibility to train the common man without criticisinganybody and without pointing towards the lacunas .'
p9225
aS"today i greet them all from the core of my heart who have done this job but i only wish to stress upon a point- from whom this  swachh bharat '' drive has gained maximum strength ?"
p9226
aS'who are its biggest brand ambassador ?'
p9227
aS'you may not have paid heed to it , but try to remember what happened in your family ?'
p9228
aS"there are crores of such families in india , whose children are in the age group of five , ten and fifteen and they have become the greatestambassador of  swachh bharat abhiyaan '' ."
p9229
aS'these children prevent their parents from littering in their homes and ask them to avoid spreading filth and rubbish here and there .'
p9230
aS'in case , any father is addicted to consuming gutka and whenever the father opens the windows of the car to spit , his son prevents him to do so on the plea of keeping india clean .'
p9231
aS'the success of this programme is due to those little children .'
p9232
aS'i wish to bow my head towards the future of my country , i wish to bow myhead and greet those children .'
p9233
aS'the fact which is not realized even by the elite people has been easily understood by the innocent children and it is my belief that such a country where a child is so much aware , so committed towards cleanliness , such country is bound to become clean ; abhorrence against filth and dirt is bound to arise there .'
p9234
aS"in 2019 we are about to celebrate the 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi and on 150th anniversary of gandhiji we have to handover him  swachh bharat '' as a tribute ."
p9235
aS'there can not be a greater tribute to mahatma gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary .'
p9236
aS'the task has just started , but i have to take it forward , not to stop it , not get to satisfied .'
p9237
aS"i had announced such a programme from here , just for a trial , so that i could ascertain whether  team india '' is able to do it ornot ."
p9238
aS'i had announced it without consulting anybody .'
p9239
aS'it was not announced after collecting relevant information from districts and villages .'
p9240
aS'it just came into my heart and i had announced that we would build separate toilets for boys and girls in all of our schools till the next 15th august .'
p9241
aS"but later on , when we started work , the  team india '' figured out its responsibilities , we realised that there were 2 lakh and 62 thousand such schools , where more than 4."
p9242
aS'25 lakh toilets wererequired to be built .'
p9243
aS"this figure was so big that any government could rethink to extend the deadline , but it certainly was the resolve of the  team india '' that no one sought any extension ."
p9244
aS"today , on this 15th august , i salute the  team india '' , who , keeping the honour of our tricolour national flag , left no stone unturned to realise that dream , and the  team india '' has now nearly achieved the target of building all the toilets ."
p9245
aS'i compliment to all the state governments , governmentofficers of the districts , policy framers and implementers of educational institutions , who were involved in realising this achievement .'
p9246
aS'this is not just an issue of building more than 4.'
p9247
aS'25 lakh toilets .'
p9248
aS'this is an issue of creating an atmosphere of self-confidence at a time , when we were so engulfed with the negativity that it was being told that nothing could happen , there was no hope , it was not possible .'
p9249
aS"but now , the  team india '' has demonstrated that we are ready to acceptchallenges , we would not withdraw , and we are committed for our success ."
p9250
aS'the nation runs on this self-confidence , the nation runs by realising newer resolutions .'
p9251
aS'we can not stop anywhere , we have to continuously move forward .'
p9252
aS"therefore , brothers and sisters , we have prepared a plan for the labourers of our country , and it has been named as  shrameva jayate '' ."
p9253
aS'our attitude towards the poor labourers is not good .'
p9254
aS'if we meet a person wearing coat , pants , tie or we meet a great person wearing long kurta , jacket we salute him by standing in his honour .'
p9255
aS'but if an auto rickshaw driver , pedal rickshaw puller , newspaper vendor or a milkman come to us , our feelings towards these poor men are not proper .'
p9256
aS'one hundred and twenty five crore citizens of the country have to remove this deficiency of the nation by their resolution of mind .'
p9257
aS'the persons due to whom we look good , who serve us good , no one isour better well wisher than them and therefor , dignity of labourers , honour of labourers , pride of labourers- this should be our national duty , this should be our national character , this should be the tendency of everyone , nature of everyone .'
p9258
aS'recently , we started a campaign of issuing special identity card to the unorganized labour falling under certain schemes .'
p9259
aS'they are to get the benefits of many schemes of security through that identity card .'
p9260
aS'these unorganized labourerswere never taken care of .'
p9261
aS'similarly , labourers of our country had deposited their share of hard earned money in government coffers .'
p9262
aS'slowly , this amount grew to rs .'
p9263
aS'27 thousand crores , but when that poor labourer moves to some another place after 6-8 months of employment there , moves to another place after a year or two from there , no account of the money he deposited there is maintained .'
p9264
aS'the amount is also so low that he does not wish to bring back the same by spending two hundredrupees on fare .'
p9265
aS'that is why rs .'
p9266
aS'27 thousand crores of poor people of my country , labourers of my country , money earned by them by the sweat of their brow was lying idle in the coffers of the government .'
p9267
aS'we found a solution to it .'
p9268
aS'we provided a special identity card number to these labourers and told them wherever you are transferred now , even if you move to another place by quitting the job or if you move from one factory to another , from one state to another , you will always retainthis number and you will retain your money , no one will be able to misappropriate your single rupee .'
p9269
aS'so , we have tried to return the rs .'
p9270
aS'27 thousand crores to the poor .'
p9271
aS'it has become a fashion in our country- make law for everything and keep our courts busy .'
p9272
aS'one law may contradict the other but the law should be on the same subject .'
p9273
aS'confusion was being created here always .'
p9274
aS'this is not a good sign for good governance and therefor , law should be explicit , law should be correct , law should not be out of sync with time , only then society progresses .'
p9275
aS'where will a poor labourer look for his thing of interest in the pile-up of different types of 44 legislations meant for our labourers ?'
p9276
aS'we have brought about a change therein .'
p9277
aS'by incorporating these 44 legislations into four codes of conduct , the poorest of the poor and even an illiterate labourer can know about his or her interest , we have emphasized this scheme .'
p9278
aS'brothers and sisters , corruption is a much discussed topic in our country .'
p9279
aS'we must have seen an ailing person , habitually , giving tips to others on how to be healthy .'
p9280
aS'he does not care for himself , but it is the nature of every human being to advise others that you do it and you will become healthy and you do that and you will become healthy .'
p9281
aS'corruption is also like this .'
p9282
aS'the person involved in it , also advise , the person who is suffering due to it , also advise and thus they advise eachother , and this goes on and on .'
p9283
aS"brothers and sisters , i have never made this announcement , but today i wish to state , i want to assure my fellow countrymen , i want to tell the  team india '' comprising 1."
p9284
aS'25 billion people that this country can become corruption-free .'
p9285
aS'on the basis of experience i am saying this .'
p9286
aS'this job has to be started from the top .'
p9287
aS'corruption is stuck with our country like a termite and the termite keeps on spreading , initially it is not visible , but when it spreads in our bedroom and reaches thecupboard where clothes are hung , we find that and when we want to get rid of it , insecticides have to be injected per square meter of land .'
p9288
aS'after so many of years of efforts , we get rid of termite .'
p9289
aS'countless efforts of several types have to be made to wipe out the corruption in such a vast country , and that can be done .'
p9290
aS'if i had said that i would cut subsidy worth rs .'
p9291
aS'15 thousand cores on lpg gas , then i can say that hundreds of articles would have been written to glorifymy government .'
p9292
aS'they can say that this man has the power and strength to discontinue the subsidy worth rs .'
p9293
aS'15 thousand cores on lpg gas .'
p9294
aS'it is this man who can take tough decision and if it is not done so , then nothing happens my dear friends and nothing is visible .'
p9295
aS'sometimes people are fond of sinking into despair .'
p9296
aS'until they talk of despair amongst people they can not sleep at night .'
p9297
aS'they have this habit .'
p9298
aS'there are some ailing people , who do not like to disclose about their illness and they also do not like to someone inquiring about their ailment .'
p9299
aS'while there are some others who wait for a particular person to enquire about their health and if he does not visit , they talk about this for hours together .'
p9300
aS'i can see that there are some people who always search for negativism , propagate negativism and they enjoy it as much as they can .'
p9301
aS'such people neither have anyschemes nor activities , yet  team india consisting of 1.'
p9302
aS'25 billion indians is ready to invest time for them , but how does that happen ?'
p9303
aS'we have put in place a scheme of direct benefit transfer of lpg subsidy .'
p9304
aS'taking advantage of jan dhan accounts and adhaar card we have transferred the subsidy directly into the accounts .'
p9305
aS'as a result of this the brokers , the middlemen and the blackmarketeers have disappeared .'
p9306
aS'only the real beneficiary got the benefit .'
p9307
aS'our government haveneither slashed a penny from anyones benefit nor we have made announcements to earn praise .'
p9308
aS'we have improved the system and today i wish to inform the team india of 1.'
p9309
aS'25 billion indians that as a result of this an amount of rs.'
p9310
aS'15 crore , which was being siphoned off annually in the name of gas cylinders has been stopped .'
p9311
aS'my countrymen , the corruption has stopped .'
p9312
aS'my brothers and sisters , you can see how work is done ?'
p9313
aS'we have done it .'
p9314
aS'rupees 15,000 crore is not a small amount for a country like india .'
p9315
aS'we have launched an open website , displayed a board of delivery there , even then if someone has a complaint , he would get a cylinder even at midnight but we can not permit those who loot the country and poors as well .'
p9316
aS'tell me whether this is not a fight against corruption ?'
p9317
aS'my brothers and sisters , i had made a request to my countrymen that if you are economically sound , then why do you avail subsidy on l .'
p9318
aS'p.'
p9319
aS'g ?'
p9320
aS'why do you need this paltry amount of rupees five to seven hundred which you usually spend on petty snacks .'
p9321
aS'i had just started giving message about this , i didnt launch any campaign as yet , because i have faith in  team india .'
p9322
aS"as the message spreads the result would come , but to-day i can tell with pride that ever-since i had launched movementof  give it up '' subsidy of lpg gas cylinder , till date 20 lakh consumers have already given it up ."
p9323
aS'this is not a small figure .'
p9324
aS'even if we are in the queue before a temple for the blessings ( prasaad ) , we sometimes wish that we should get some of the prasad for our younger brother also .'
p9325
aS'this is in our nature .'
p9326
aS'these 20 lakh people are not from rich or wealthy families .'
p9327
aS'they are all from the common middle class .'
p9328
aS'some teacher may have been a pensioner , but when he learnt that this lpg cylinder may go to some poor person , he gave up his subsidy .'
p9329
aS'my dear brothers and sisters , when these 20lakh lpg cylinders will reach the poor families whose kitchens are smoke choked , just think of the happiness of the mothers working in those kitchens !'
p9330
aS'just think of the relief and happiness of the little children who had been crying due to the smoke !'
p9331
aS'whenever our efforts are in the right direction , we get great results .'
p9332
aS'my brothers and sisters , if i talk about coal , some of the political pundits or experts will judge me on a political angle .'
p9333
aS'this is not a place for politicking , so i would like to urge upon all the political pundits that in this case , the kind of coal issue that i am going to raise , may please not be judged through the political angle .'
p9334
aS'this is the requirement of our nations resolve .'
p9335
aS'cag said that when coal blocks were allocated through lottery , the nation lost rs.'
p9336
aS'1 lakh and 74 thousandcrores .'
p9337
aS'we also used this statistics in the election-speeches .'
p9338
aS'nevertheless , we sometimes thought that this much of loss may not have been there .'
p9339
aS'but we went on saying like that .'
p9340
aS'later we decided that whether it be coal , or spectrum or any other mineral , all will be auctioned henceforth .'
p9341
aS'lo and behold !'
p9342
aS'the great strength of the team india of 125 crore indians and their resolve !'
p9343
aS'within a certain time limit the coal was auctioned and now almost rs .'
p9344
aS'3 lakh crore would beaccruing to the national exchequer .'
p9345
aS'brothers and sisters , just ask yourselves whether corruption was rooted out or not ?'
p9346
aS'whether the middlemen were ousted or not ?'
p9347
aS'whether the door was shut on the face of the wealth-stealers of india or not ?'
p9348
aS'i did not make any speech in this regard .'
p9349
aS'i just did it .'
p9350
aS'the same thing happened in the case of spectrum .'
p9351
aS'right now fm radio auction is going on .'
p9352
aS'a lot of pressure was put on me .'
p9353
aS'people said modi ji , fm is operated by the common men , there in no great profit in this business .'
p9354
aS'whyare you putting even fm on auction ?'
p9355
aS'a lot of pressure was put on me .'
p9356
aS'all attempts were made to dissuade me from this .'
p9357
aS'but i said that the team india consisting of 125 crore of indians wanted transparency .'
p9358
aS'right now the auction is on for fm radio in some 80-85 cities .'
p9359
aS'the day before when i enquired , the auction amount had crossed rs .'
p9360
aS'one thousand crores .'
p9361
aS'this money is going to be used for the poor people .'
p9362
aS'brothers and sisters , what a run the country had at the hands of its leadership , how it was looted , what impact was put on the policies !'
p9363
aS'what kind of an activity it was that continued in the country ?'
p9364
aS'imported coal from the foreign countries was not given to the power plants near the coasts .'
p9365
aS'it was transported to the factories of nearby areas of coal mines and the coal from those mines instead was taken to the factories in the coastal region .'
p9366
aS'now , even a small child in this country canunderstand as to how the goods can be utilized for the place where they are situated instead of going for their transport from that place to the other .'
p9367
aS'brothers and sisters , we changed that decision .'
p9368
aS'nearby factories should be the first beneficiaries .'
p9369
aS'and let me say that this small decision closed down the shops of the middlemen and the exchequer has got rs .'
p9370
aS'1100 crores .'
p9371
aS'my dear citizens , it will happen every year now .'
p9372
aS'corruption in a way has become part of the system .'
p9373
aS'until it is stamped out from the system , dear brothers and sisters , ill keep suffering every atrocity , facing every obstacle but with your blessings i shall fulfill the dream of a corruption free india .'
p9374
aS'i say this to you from the ramparts of the red fort with the tricolour as my witness and the understanding of the dreams of the 125 crore people .'
p9375
aS'its been 15 months since you put our government in centre and gave me the mandate .'
p9376
aS'this government does not have any allegation of corruption against it for even a single penny .'
p9377
aS'but i had said alongside that it was like the pests , the termite .'
p9378
aS'corruption free government in delhi only is not going to solve the whole problem .'
p9379
aS'there are problems at the small places right now and the poor are getting troubled .'
p9380
aS'we need to bring in a national level awareness for this .'
p9381
aS'we need to comprehend this menace of corruption properly and get everyone on board to eradicate it .'
p9382
aS'then only can we get rid of the menace .'
p9383
aS'brothers and sisters , let me say further that we have taken some very important steps one after the other to check black money , and that too in a very short span of time .'
p9384
aS'the day we formed the government , we constituted an sit under the supervision of the supreme court .'
p9385
aS'we did what was pending for three years .'
p9386
aS'the sit is doing its job .'
p9387
aS'i attended the g-20 summit .'
p9388
aS'these are the countries whose support we need for bringing black money back .'
p9389
aS'on indias insistence a resolution was passed against black money .'
p9390
aS'all g-20 countries resolved to cooperate with each other and send back the black money to the country where it belonged .'
p9391
aS'we adopted fatca along with theunited states .'
p9392
aS'we have signed agreements with many countries for receiving real time information regarding indians black money .'
p9393
aS'we have taken several measures to check black money .'
p9394
aS'brothers and sisters , we have passed a strict law for this .'
p9395
aS'after this enactment every week people call us and complain that we have passed a very stringent law .'
p9396
aS'they call it a draconian law and a black law and say that officers would harass them .'
p9397
aS'dear fellow citizens , we need injections if the disease is serious .'
p9398
aS'doctors also warn us about the side effects of such injections .'
p9399
aS'similarly , this disease is so serious that if we want a treatment , we will have to bear the side effects also .'
p9400
aS'i know that people are upset with the law which we have passed .'
p9401
aS'they find it troublesome .'
p9402
aS'we have received many messages for diluting the provisions and relaxing it .'
p9403
aS'today i would like to tell team india of 125 crore countrymen that even while bearing the side effects , we are moving forward against black money .'
p9404
aS'this much has been done .'
p9405
aS'its a fact that the process of bringing back the black money is long but now no one can dare to send the black money out of the country .'
p9406
aS'this much has beenachieved , whether someone believes it or not .'
p9407
aS'not only this , we have given some grace period for declaring undisclosed income and today i can say that people have come forward and declared their undisclosed income amounting to rs .'
p9408
aS'6500 crores .'
p9409
aS'this amount will accrue to our exchequer .'
p9410
aS'it will benefit the poor of india .'
p9411
aS'friends , i assure you all that we will move forward with all the resolve to fulfill the commitments we have made .'
p9412
aS'brothers and sisters , cbi had registered only eight hundred cases in the entire one year before formation of our government .'
p9413
aS'we are still new in power but we have already registered eighteen hundred cases since we took charge ; we have taken action against government employees .'
p9414
aS'you can easily imagine and compare the figures .'
p9415
aS'in the entire one year before we came to power , only eight hundred cases were registered and in the ten months of our government the corresponding numberis eighteen hundred .'
p9416
aS'it shows our ability to fight corruption .'
p9417
aS'in 2005 , a law namely pmla was framed in our country .'
p9418
aS'in ten years , an amount of ten thousand crore rupees has been recovered under that law .'
p9419
aS'but you would be surprised to know that out of the total recovered amount of ten thousand crore rupees , four thousand five hundred crore rupees have been recovered in the last ten months .'
p9420
aS'this is another example of our commitment to fight corruption about which we are not talking in press conferences on tv ; rather we have taken steps onthe ground and reaped success .'
p9421
aS'we have endeavored to change systems .'
p9422
aS'we have taken steps to ensure that the mgnrega wages go directly to the jan dhan account ; that the scholarship for students goes directly into their bank accounts ; and that there is least brokerage .'
p9423
aS'and i believe that because of these steps the country can fulfill those objectives .'
p9424
aS'my farmer brothers and sisters , last year we had deficient rainfall .'
p9425
aS'it was less than required .'
p9426
aS'it affected the economy as well as our farmers .'
p9427
aS'we were still able to curb the price rise .'
p9428
aS'one will have to admit the fact that before us , the inflation was in double digits .'
p9429
aS'since we came to power , although there has been less rain and the farmers were distressed ; we have been successful in bringing down the inflation from double digits to 3-4 percent .'
p9430
aS'we will continue to striveto bring it further down because our dream is to provide wholesome meals to the poorest of the poor .'
p9431
aS'however , we need drastic changes in the agriculture sector .'
p9432
aS'the cultivable land is shrinking ; it is getting divided between families and pieces of land are getting smaller .'
p9433
aS'the fertility and productivity of our agricultural land must increase .'
p9434
aS'the farmers need water and electricity and we are working towards their availability .'
p9435
aS'we have decided to pump in fifty thousand crore rupees inpradhaan mantri krishi sinchaai yojna .'
p9436
aS'how will the water reach the farms ?'
p9437
aS'water will have to be saved .'
p9438
aS'we have to launch a movement in our agricultural sector with the mantra of save water , save energy , and save fertilizers .'
p9439
aS'hence , per drop more crop is our watchword ; each drop of water can contribute towards producing more crop and hence successful farming .'
p9440
aS'we have moved in the direction of spending funds to take this cause further .'
p9441
aS'in the recent past , when our crops got damaged due to hailstorm , we increased the compensation enormously .'
p9442
aS'such an increase has never been witnessed in the past 60 years .'
p9443
aS'not only this , earlier if there were any losses , there was the norm according to which one would be entitled for compensation only if the losses suffered were at least 50 per cent .'
p9444
aS'we have brought it down to 30 per cent .'
p9445
aS'never in the past 60 years was such a great initiative of helping the farmers taken .'
p9446
aS'farmersneed urea .'
p9447
aS'i would like to tell once again as to how to fight corruption .'
p9448
aS'neem-coating is not the brain child of modi , rather it is an idea propounded by scientists and this idea has not only been brought before my government , it has come before previous governments as well .'
p9449
aS'in our country , urea worth millions and billions of rupees is allocated in the names of farmers , but 15 , 20 or 25 per cent of this urea is diverted to the chemical factories as raw material .'
p9450
aS'allocated in the names offarmers , this urea is pilfered through the middlemen .'
p9451
aS'this pilferage of urea can not be stopped unless we go for cent per cent neem-coating of urea .'
p9452
aS'therefore , irrespective of the burden caused to the exchequer , we have accomplished the task of doing hundred per cent neem-coating of urea .'
p9453
aS'as a result of this , now urea can not be used for any purpose other than farming .'
p9454
aS'now , no chemical factory can indulge in any kind of pilferage of urea .'
p9455
aS'the farmers will have as much urea asthey need .'
p9456
aS'since the urea is neem coated , even if they use 10 per cent less of urea , their land will be benefitted with the nutritional value it requires .'
p9457
aS'the farmers of my country will be having a new advantage of urea - i would suggest to all the farmers that even if by chance someone shows you urea without neem-coating , you take it to be unauthorized by the government .'
p9458
aS'if someone gives you a yellow powder , dont even touch it .'
p9459
aS'brothers and sisters , india can not develop till the eastern part of the country develops .'
p9460
aS'india can not be said to be developing only on the basis of the development of the western parts of the country .'
p9461
aS'india will move ahead only when our eastern uttar pradesh becomes prosperous , our bihar becomes strong , our west bengal , assam , odisha , north eastern regions tread the path of development .'
p9462
aS'these territories of india should become powerful .'
p9463
aS'and so whether is a matter ofinfrastructure or of rail connectivity or of digital connectivity - in all these aspects , we have focussed on eastern india .'
p9464
aS'this focus has resulted in the proposed laying of a gas pipe line in this region .'
p9465
aS'who could have thought that the states where there was no potable tap water even in kitchen , there we are working to supply the gas through pipe lines .'
p9466
aS'four urea fertilizer plants were shut down in eastern india .'
p9467
aS'youth of these states were unemployed and farmers were in distress .'
p9468
aS'we havemade new urea policy and we have also formulated new gas supply policy .'
p9469
aS'this has resulted in revival of fertilizer plants of eastern centers of gorakhpur , barauni , talcher and sindari .'
p9470
aS'thus we are working to provide employment to the youth and fertilizers to the farmers .'
p9471
aS'brothers and sisters , there is a government department for army soldiers and for their welfare .'
p9472
aS'in our country farmers are as important as soldiers .'
p9473
aS'what have we done in sixty years !'
p9474
aS'we have emphasized on the economic aspect of agriculture .'
p9475
aS'with the intention to have flourishing agriculture and for agricultural advancement , the concerned ministry of this government has been named as ministry of agriculture .'
p9476
aS'brothers and sisters , agricultural growth is as important as the welfare of farmers .'
p9477
aS'only talking about agricultural development is incomplete for rural life style and for agriculture based livelihood .'
p9478
aS'that will become complete , when the welfare of the farmer is also linked .'
p9479
aS"brothers and sisters , the ministry of the government of india which was earlier known as  ministry of agriculture '' , from now will be known as the  ministry of farmer welfare '' and in the days to comeschemes for the welfare of farmers will also be formulated alike the schemes for agriculture are prepared and the government would make efforts to provide help to the farmers by means of setting permanent system for the problems that my farmers has to face in his personal life , the hurdles that he has to go through ."
p9480
aS'brothers and sisters , in the coming days i wish to concentrate on an issue .'
p9481
aS'there has been so many years of independence but even today there are about eighteen thousand , five hundred such villages in our country , where electric wires and polls are yet to reach .'
p9482
aS'eighteen thousand five hundred villages are deprived of the sun of independence , deprived of the light of independence , they are deprived of the rays of development of independence .'
p9483
aS'if we will keep on following the oldmethods , perhaps it will take ten more years to electrify these eighteen thousand , five hundred villages with wires and polls .'
p9484
aS'the country is not ready to wait for ten years .'
p9485
aS'i took the meeting of government officials and enquired from them about the timeline .'
p9486
aS'someone promised to complete the task till 2019 , someone assured to complete it till 2022 .'
p9487
aS'some were hesitant due to dense forests or snowy hills , and some had apprehension due to inaccessibility of certain areas .'
p9488
aS"but , it is now the solemn pledge of the  team india '' of 1."
p9489
aS'25 billion countrymen that the target of providing electric polls , electric wires and electricity to these 18,500villages would be achieved within next 1000 days .'
p9490
aS'i urge upon the states to come forward and accept this challenge .'
p9491
aS'this is not pending in every state , only a few states will have to strive a little further .'
p9492
aS'i would not like to count the name of such states , as it would be viewed politically and may attract political comments .'
p9493
aS'hence , its better to avoid it .'
p9494
aS'i , therefore , announce the pledge of the team india of our 1.'
p9495
aS'25 billion countrymen , from the red fort , that electricity would bemade available to 18,500 villages within the next 1000 days , with the help of states and local bodies .'
p9496
aS'i have taken up another issue of concern , which is welfare of farmers .'
p9497
aS'similar issue of grave concern is the under-development of such mining areas , from where we get mineral resources , such as coal , bauxite and other minerals .'
p9498
aS'now , look at the life of people there .'
p9499
aS'they sweat to make our country rich but that region is not developed and , therefore , we have formulated a special scheme for the development of the labourers and farmers of the region from where minerals are extractedand around rupees six thousand crores will be spent every year on the regions which fall in the areas of my tribals brothers , located in my tribal areas .'
p9500
aS'where coal is found ?'
p9501
aS'coal is found in tribal areas .'
p9502
aS'we have undertaken work to see development takes place there .'
p9503
aS'brother and sisters , our youth power is of import for taking the country forward in twenty first century and today , i want to declare that if we have to move ahead in comparison to the whole world , we have to encourage our youths , we have to provide them opportunities .'
p9504
aS'how our youths become new entrepreneurs , how our youths become new producers , how a complete network of start-up by these new entrepreneurs is set up in the whole country ?'
p9505
aS'there should not be any district , any block inhindustan where there are not start-up initiated in the coming days .'
p9506
aS'whether india can not dream that india becomes number one in the world of start-up .'
p9507
aS'today we are not at that position .'
p9508
aS"brothers and sisters , i have to provide strength to start-up and , therefore , i resolve that in the coming days  start-up india '' and  stand-up india '' will be there or the future of the country ."
p9509
aS"and for a bright future of the country  stand-up india '' shall be launched when i want to moveforward this job pertaining to  start-up india '' ,  stand-up india '' , my brothers and sisters , in our country our bank officials have done a herculean task , and when you do a good job , my expectations rise a lot ."
p9510
aS'my banker friends , my expectations are rising , so please do not get offended , but i trust you that your subordinate staff is contributing a lot for the economic advancement of this nation and in future they will continue to put in further more efforts .'
p9511
aS'i want to assign you a task today .'
p9512
aS'there are 1.'
p9513
aS'25 lakhs banking units i .'
p9514
aS'e .'
p9515
aS'1.'
p9516
aS'25 lakhs branches of banks in the country .'
p9517
aS'today , i would like to assign a task to these 1.'
p9518
aS'25 lakhs branches .'
p9519
aS'this year marks the 125th anniversary of dr.'
p9520
aS'babasaheb ambedkarji .'
p9521
aS'there are 1 crore 25 lakhs branches of banks .'
p9522
aS"this is my programme referred to as  start-up india '' , under this programme more schemes will be formulated , but every branch must resolve and in the days to come resolve once again to disburse loans for start-ups to the tribals in the locality where there is any tribal habitation , and where there is no tribal habitation , the branch can provide loans to a dalit or a tribal , give financial support to them and thusenable 1."
p9523
aS'25 lakhs dalit entrepreneurs to come up .'
p9524
aS'let there be tribal entrepreneurs in the tribal settlements of this country .'
p9525
aS'we can do this , we can give a new dimension to start-up and secondly whether these one lakh twenty five thousand branches can formulate a special scheme for women entrepreneurs ?'
p9526
aS'these one lakh twenty five thousand branches should promote start-up of women entrepreneurs and help them financially .'
p9527
aS'you will find that with in no time , india would see a network ofstart up , new entrepreneurs would emerge and they would in-turn provide employment ranging form one to two to four persons which will transform indias economic life .'
p9528
aS'brothers and sisters , when investment comes to the country , we expect more manufacturing work and more exports and the finance department of the government offer new schemes to such investors .'
p9529
aS'it has its own significance and this should continue .'
p9530
aS'but today i have a new idea that the investment coming to our country in the manufacturing sector should be offered assistance based on new parameters and one of them shall be that an investor who comes with an enterprise which providesemployment to maximum persons would be eligible for a different kind of economic package .'
p9531
aS'the government would now formulate new schemes for new units linking it with employment and assistance of government .'
p9532
aS'we want to stress upon the growth of employment opportunities in the country .'
p9533
aS'we have reached far beyond in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of skill india and digital india .'
p9534
aS'brothers and sisters , one area of corruption is job .'
p9535
aS'the poorest of the poor man aspires for his sons job and we have seen that whenever a youth receives a call for an interview for a job , may be that is for interview in railway , for a teacher , for a peon , for a driver , he began to think about who he should approach for recommendation ?'
p9536
aS'even his widow mother begin to brood over the issue .'
p9537
aS'why ?'
p9538
aS'that is because in our country justice and injustice are mostly decided on the basis of interview rather than the basis of merit and it is said that the person has failed in the interview .'
p9539
aS'i have not seen any such psychologist till now , who are capable of assessing a person onthe basis of interviewing him just for two minutes .'
p9540
aS'brothers and sisters , i have been thinking over it for many days that whether it is necessary to appear for an interview for a son of a poor mother , for a less educated person who is in need of petty jobs ?'
p9541
aS'whether he cant get any job without an interview ?'
p9542
aS'whether on the basis of his mark-sheet online -- it should be decided on the basis of online mark sheet that if we require five hundred people , than who should be those initial five hundred people , then who should be initialtwo thousand people .'
p9543
aS'of course , where the testing of physical fitness is required , the norms and system could vary there .'
p9544
aS'personality and experience of a candidate matters only for jobs of senior ranks , but it is painful to see that candidates even from the states of nagaland and mizoram rush to mumbai to appear in exams for junior-level posts in railways .'
p9545
aS'i have to combat this problem .'
p9546
aS'i impress upon the state governments and my colleagues of the government to discontinue the stageof interview for junior-level posts as soon as possible .'
p9547
aS'such jobs should be given just on the basis of merit .'
p9548
aS'this would help in curbing corruption , which hurts the poor people , and it would ease out their problem .'
p9549
aS'it is my appeal to endeavour towards this goal .'
p9550
aS'my countrymen enjoy sound sleep .'
p9551
aS'but , if our 1.'
p9552
aS'25 billion countrymen are able to enjoy their undisturbed sleep , it is only due to ever-readiness of our jawans to sacrifice themselves , who are posted at the borders .'
p9553
aS'no country can under-evaluate the importance of its armed forces .'
p9554
aS'for the team india of 1.'
p9555
aS'25 billion countrymen , each and every soldier or jawan is the strength of the nation , wealth of the nation and force of the nation .'
p9556
aS'many successive governments have come and gone overthe years .'
p9557
aS"the issue of  one rank one pension '' has come before every government , each one has considered its proposal , and each and every government has made promises on it , but the problem is still pending to be resolved ."
p9558
aS'after my assuming office as prime minister i have not been able to do this by now .'
p9559
aS"today , i am again assuring all the service personnel and this is not being said by one man , i am saying this on behalf of one hundred and twenty five crores people of  team india '' ."
p9560
aS'i am saying this under the tricolour from the ramparts of the red fort .'
p9561
aS"i say to service personnel , we have accepted  one rank one pension '' in principal but talks are going on with its organizations ."
p9562
aS'talks havereached at the final stage and we want that all get justice keeping in view the development of whole country .'
p9563
aS'we have to find the solution of this problem in the light of above context which is lingering on from 20-25 years .'
p9564
aS'i believe that the trust in which talks are being held , some positive result will come out of it .'
p9565
aS"and , therefore , i again assure that this government has accepted  one rank one pension '' in principal ."
p9566
aS'how it is implemented in view of its nitty-gritty situation , weare taking the talks forward by engaging with its stakeholders .'
p9567
aS'brothers and sisters , india is completing 75 years of its independence in 2022 .'
p9568
aS'we have not to sit idle after celebrating 75 years of indias independence on 15th august , 2022 .'
p9569
aS'today itself , on this 15th august , let we have a resolution for the 15th august , 2022 that 6 lakhs villages of india , each village must decide and resolve that by 2022 , we will be able to overcome problem in every village .'
p9570
aS'my 1.'
p9571

p9601
aS'we make this choice with the natural instinct of our heritage and culture .'
p9602
aS'but , we also do this in our enlightened self-interest and with a commitment to the future of our planet .'
p9603
aS'that is why we have set a target of additional capacity of 175 gw of renewable energy by 2022 .'
p9604
aS'national action will succeed only through a strong international partnership .'
p9605
aS'as much as we speak of goals and emission reductions , we should focus equally on access to affordable technology and adequate finance that makes transition to clean energy natural and easy .'
p9606
aS'otherwise , experience shows that targets will remain difficult dreams .'
p9607
aS'we must equally seek a global commitment to supportadaptation to the growing impact of climate change on our lives and economy .'

aS'we also propose to hold an international conference on ocean economy and pacific island countries in new delhi in 2016 .'
p9617
aS'we will be delighted to host officials and independent experts of all 14 pacific island countries .'
p9618
aS'indian navy has provided direct support and capacity building to island states in indian ocean , especially for coastal surveillance and hydrographic surveys .'
p9619
aS'this has helped them get a better understanding of their maritime zone and strengthen security of their eezs .'
p9620
aS'we would be prepared to extend this assistance to our pacific island partners .'
p9621
aS'we also look forward to goodwill visits by indian navy to pacific islands .'
p9622
aS'the ships could also extend support in areas like healthcare through medical camps on the islands .'
p9623
aS'not only is our future closely linked to space and oceans , there is also a close relationship between the two .'
p9624
aS'space assets and technology can help us in inventory of land and water resources ; fish zoning ; forest resources management ; coastal and ocean studies ; weather and climate change ; and , disaster management support .'

p9630
aS'human resource development has been a key area of cooperation .'
p9631
aS'there is no other form of cooperation that is as effective in building a nations future .'
p9632
aS'for the indian technical and economic cooperation training programme , fiji will get 110 slots , and the number of slots for the other 13 countries will be doubled from 119 to 238 .'

p9645
aS'we are ready to set up a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and distribution centre in the pacific island region and are pleased to offer a line of credit for this project .'
p9646
aS'human bonds are the strongest foundation for enduring relations between nations .'

p9652
aS'we will also support creation of india centres through e-libraries and supply books to libraries at universities in your countries .'
p9653
aS'excellencies , in the short time together , we have made concrete progress .'

aS'this partnership will be of great relevance to all of us in the 21st century .'
p9657
aS'your support to this partnership means a lot to india .'
p9658
aS'we see this as a partnership of equals , driven by similar aspirations , in which we will all be more successful by being together .'
p9659
aS'it stems from our belief in vasudhaivakutumbakam the world is one and from the conviction that in sharing what we have , we enrich each other and make this world a better place .'
p9660
aS'it is a great honour to have you with us .'
p9661
aS'i hope you have had an enjoyable visit to india .'
p9662
aS'we hope that this would inspire you to visit us more often .'
p9663
aS'thank you .'
p9664
aa(lp9665
S'excellencies , it is truly a great honour and privilege to host you in india for the second summit of forum for india pacific islands cooperation fipic , as it is called now .'
p9666
aS'i am deeply grateful to you for coming to india .'
p9667
aS'i am aware that the journey is not short and you have busy schedules .'
p9668
aS'but , i also know that familiarity shrinks distances .'
p9669
aS'i was pleased to join our president in greeting you in delhi yesterday .'
p9670
aS'i hope you have enjoyed delhi , agra and jaipur and that our team let you shop a bit .'
p9671
aS'i hope you liked your visit to taj mahal .'
p9672
aS'if you are visiting india for the first time , i am sure you are struck by the size , the culture , the diversity and the sea of people , like we are wonderstruck at the thought of a nation living as a small community in harmony with nature on a beautiful island !'
p9673
aS'it is this diversity that makes our planet so special !'
p9674
aS'i especially welcome you in this historic city of jaipur .'
p9675
aS'the pink city is known for the pink sandstones of its famous palaces .'
p9676
aS'it is a city of heroism and valour , of art and heritage , and , above all , a strong tradition of hospitality .'
p9677
aS'i thank chief minister smt vasudhara raje for her generous support .'
p9678
aS'this is the first regional summit that i am hosting in india .'
p9679
aS'this one will always remain very special for me .'
p9680
aS'it is also special because india and pacific island countries are setting an example of partnerships for this century .'
p9681
aS'it is a partnership forged by shared aspirations and challenges .'
p9682
aS'it is shaped by the belief that all nations , small and large , have equal stakes in this world .'
p9683
aS'we also recognise that a globalised world has deepened inter-dependence and changed our perception of geography .'
p9684
aS'in particular , the centre of gravity of global opportunities and challenges are shifting to the pacific and indian ocean region .'
p9685
aS'the fortunes of nations in and around the two oceans are inter-linked .'
p9686
aS'for this reason , the tides that bear hopes and bring challenges to the shores in india and the pacific islands are the same .'
p9687
aS'that is why some call the region the indo-pacific region .'
p9688
aS'but that is not all that brings us together .'
p9689
aS'small island states may add up to small land area and even smaller population .'
p9690
aS'but , they are as important for us as any other nation .'
p9691
aS'we have and will stand with you in international forums .'
p9692
aS'it is with this sense of solidarity that we made the strongest contribution to the sids conference in samoa last year , which led to the evolution of the samoa pathway .'
p9693
aS'we also supported the interests of sids on capacity building in the latest outcome document on the post-2015 development agenda .'
p9694
aS'india stands shoulder to shoulder with you for a dedicated seat for sids in an expanded and reformed united nations security council in both categories .'
p9695
aS'india will support the realisation of your vision of pacific regionalism .'
p9696
aS'it is a shining example of cooperative regionalism that should inspire others around the world .'
p9697
aS'excellencies , the world may see you as small islands with modest populations .'
p9698
aS'i see you as large ocean states with vast potential .'
p9699
aS'some of you have exclusive economic zones that are larger than the landmass and exclusive economic zone of india taken together .'
p9700
aS'we are at the cusp of a new era , where oceans , like space , will become important drivers of our economies .'
p9701
aS'their sustainable use can bring prosperity ; and , give us clean energy , new medicines and food security beyond just fisheries .'
p9702
aS'ocean is critical to indias future , too .'
p9703
aS'that is why , in the past year , i have focused a lot on ocean economy , both in india and international engagement .'
p9704
aS'i see huge potential for our cooperation in this area .'
p9705
aS'india was pleased to stand with you in ensuring that sustainable use of oceans and marine resources constitute a distinct element in the sustainable development goals in the united nations that were finalised recently .'
p9706
aS'our global challenges are similar .'
p9707
aS'climate change is an existential threat to the pacific islands .'
p9708
aS'it is also taking a toll on the teaming millions on indias shoreline of 7500 kilometres and its nearly 1300 islands .'
p9709
aS'we both seek a concrete and effective outcome on climate change at cop 21 in paris later this year .'
p9710
aS'we worked together for a separate goal on climate change in the sustainable development goals , and in a manner that addresses the interests of developing countries .'
p9711
aS'we must also build closer partnership in pursuit of our shared aims in the wto-for example on fisheries .'
p9712
aS'the united nations is at a historic milestone of its 70th anniversary .'
p9713
aS'i have written to all member states on charting the course for the united nations for the years ahead .'
p9714
aS'seven decades after the united nations was created , the world is a different place .'
p9715
aS'we have four times as many nations .'
p9716
aS'we have new challenges like climate change .'
p9717
aS'we have new frontiers like space and ocean .'
p9718
aS'we live in a globalised world with a transformed economy in a digital age .'
p9719
aS'the united nations must keep pace with the changing world .'
p9720
aS'we must press for reform in the united nations security council to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in the 21st century .'
p9721
aS'we seek your support for the text of the president of the general assembly as a basis for reforming the security council .'
p9722
aS'your voice of support for indias permanent membership of the security council will give the united nations the global character and balance that mirrors our age .'
p9723
aS'excellencies , just as fipic should become our springboard for a stronger global partnership , we can also enrich each other through our bilateral and regional cooperation .'
p9724
aS'during the last summit , india announced a number of new initiatives with the pacific islands countries .'
p9725
aS'i am pleased that we have been able to deliver on many of our commitments .'
p9726
aS'these include increasing indias grant-in-aid to pacific island countries from 125,000 to 200,000 u .'
p9727
aS's.'
p9728
aS'dollars , e-tourist visas , deputation of indian experts in the area of coir industry and a special training programme for diplomats of the pacific island countries .'
p9729
aS'trade , more than aid , is the enabler for development .'
p9730
aS'i am pleased to announce the establishment of the fipic trade office in the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry in new delhi .'
p9731
aS'this is just the first step towards promoting trade and investment opportunities between india and pacific island countries .'
p9732
aS'excellencies , people of indian origin in many of your countries provide a special human link between us .'
p9733
aS'excellencies , i eagerly look forward to hearing your views .'
p9734
aS'i will also share my thoughts on our future initiatives to take this wonderful partnership forward .'
p9735
aS'i want to say a special word of thanks for your support for the record-breaking adoption of international day of yoga by the united nations , and for making the first international day of yoga a grand success in your countries .'
p9736
aS'in conclusion , i wish to say that the world is more magnificent for the rich gems of island states .'
p9737
aS'and , life on these islands is a beautiful proof of gods will and human spirit .'
p9738
aS'we will work together to sustain and nurture some of natures most precious gifts and some of this worlds most wonderful people .'
p9739
aS'thank you .'
p9740
aa(lp9741
S'excellencies , mahatma gandhi had once said , one must care about the world one will not see .'
p9742
aS'indeed , humanity has progressed when it has collectively risen to its obligation to the world and responsibility to the future .'
p9743
aS'seventy years after the end of a tragic war and birth of a new hope for our age , we are meeting to chart a course for our humanity and our planet .'
p9744
aS'i consider this a very important summit and thank un secretary general for organizing it .'
p9745
aS'just as our vision behind the agenda 2030 is lofty , our goals are comprehensive .'
p9746
aS'it gives priority to the problems that have endured through the past decades .'
p9747
aS'and , it reflects our evolving understanding of the social , economic and environmental linkages that define our lives .'
p9748
aS'we live in an age of unprecedented prosperity , but also unspeakable deprivation around the world .'
p9749
aS'i am pleased that elimination of poverty in all forms everywhere is at the top of our goals .'
p9750
aS'addressing the needs of 1.'
p9751
aS'3 billion poor people in the world is not merely a question of their survival and dignity or our moral responsibility .'
p9752
aS'it is a vital necessity for ensuring peaceful , sustainable and just world .'
p9753
aS'a great indian thinker , pandit deen dayal upadhyay , placed the welfare of the poorest at the centre of his thoughts .'
p9754
aS'this is what we also see in the 2030 agenda .'
p9755
aS'it is a happy coincidence that we are beginning the celebration of pandit deen dayal upadhyays 100th anniversary today .'
p9756
aS'the goals recognize that economic growth , industrialization , infrastructure , and access to energy provide the foundations of development .'
p9757
aS'we welcome the prominence given to environmental goals , especially climate change and sustainable consumption .'
p9758
aS'the distinct goal on ocean ecosystem reflects the unique character of its challenges and opportunities .'
p9759
aS'equally important , it focuses our attention on the future of the island states .'
p9760
aS'i speak about blue revolution , which includes the prosperity , sustainable use of marine wealth and blue skies .'
p9761
aS'today , much of indias development agenda is mirrored in the sustainable development goals .'
p9762
aS'since independence , we have pursued the dream of eliminating poverty from india .'
p9763
aS'we have chosen the path of removing poverty by empowering the poor .'
p9764
aS'we have placed priority on education and skill development .'
p9765
aS'our attack on poverty today includes expanded conventional schemes of development , but we have also launched a new era of inclusion and empowerment , turning distant dreams into immediate possibilities : new bank accounts for 180 million ; direct transfer of benefits ; funds to the unbanked ; insurance within the reach of all ; and , pension for everyones sunset years .'
p9766
aS'the world speaks of private sector and public sector .'
p9767
aS'in india , we have defined a new personal sector of individual enterprise , micro enterprises and micro finance , drawing also on the strength of digital and mobile applications .'
p9768
aS'we are focusing on the basics : housing , power , water and sanitation for all important not just for welfare , but also human dignity .'
p9769
aS'these are goals with a definite date , not just a mirage of hope .'
p9770
aS'our development is intrinsically linked to empowerment of women and it begins with a massive programme on educating the girl child that has become every familys mission .'
p9771
aS'we are making our farms more productive and better connected to markets ; and , farmers less vulnerable to the whims of nature .'
p9772
aS'we are reviving our manufacturing , improving our services sector , investing on an unprecedented scale in infrastructure ; and , making our cities smart , sustainable and engines of progress .'
p9773
aS'we are committed to a sustainable path to prosperity .'
p9774
aS'it comes from the natural instinct of our tradition and culture .'
p9775
aS'but , it is also rooted firmly in our commitment to the future .'
p9776
aS'we represent a culture that calls our planet mother earth .'
p9777
aS'as our ancient text say :  keep pure !'
p9778
aS'for the earth is our mother !'
p9779
aS'and we are her children !'
p9780
aS"'' our national plans are ambitious and purposeful : new capacity of 175 gw of renewable energy over the next seven years ; energy efficiency ; a tax on coal ; a huge afforestation programme ; reforming our transportation ; and , cleaning up our cities and rivers ."
p9781
aS'the energy intensity of our growth will continue to decline .'
p9782
aS'sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be of great consequence to the world and our beautiful planet .'
p9783
aS'it will be a world of fewer challenges and greater hope ; and , more confident of its success .'
p9784
aS'our success will give us more resources to share with our friends .'
p9785
aS'as indias ancient saying goes , the wise look at the world as one family .'
p9786
aS'today , india is fulfilling its responsibilities as development partners in asia and africa and with small island states from the pacific to the atlantic .'
p9787
aS'nations have a national responsibility for sustainable development .'
p9788
aS'they also need policy space .'
p9789
aS'however , we are here today in the united nations because we all believe that international partnership must be at the centre of our efforts , whether it is development or combating climate change .'
p9790
aS'and , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the bedrock of our collective enterprise .'
p9791
aS'when we speak only of climate change , there is a perception of our desire to secure the comforts of our lifestyle .'
p9792
aS'when we speak of climate justice , we demonstrate our sensitivity and resolve to secure the future of the poor from the perils of natural disasters .'
p9793
aS'in addressing climate change , it is important to focus on solutions that can help us reach our goals .'
p9794
aS'we should forge a global public partnership to harness technology , innovation and finance to put affordable clean and renewable energy within the reach of all .'
p9795
aS'equally , we must look for changes in our lifestyles that would make us less dependent on energy and more sustainable in our consumption .'
p9796
aS'it is equally critical to launch a global education programme that prepares our next generation to protect and conserve nature .'
p9797
aS'i hope that the developed world will fulfil its financing commitments for development and climate change , without in any way putting both under the same head !'
p9798
aS'i also hope that the technology facilitation mechanism will turn technology and innovation into an effective instrument for global public good , not just private returns .'
p9799
aS'as we see now , distance is no insulation from challenges .'
p9800
aS'and , they can rise from the shadows of conflict and privations from distant lands .'
p9801
aS'so , we must transform international partnerships on the strength of solidarity with fellow human beings and also our enlightened self-interest .'
p9802
aS'and , we must also reform the united nations , including its security council , so that it carries greater credibility and legitimacy and will be more representative and effective in achieving our goals .'
p9803
aS'there is no cause greater than shaping a world , in which every life that enters it can look to a future of security , opportunity and dignity ; and , where we leave our environment in better shape for the next generation .'
p9804
aS'and , no cause that is more challenging .'
p9805
aS'at 70 , we are called to rise to that challenge , with our wisdom , experience , generosity , compassion , skills and technology .'
p9806
aS'i am confident that we can .'
p9807
aS'in the end , let me express my hope for everyones well with a few lines from our ancient texts : may all be happy , may all be healthy , may all see welfare , may no one have any sorrow .'
p9808
aS'thank you .'
p9809

aS'president and i place strong emphasis on ocean or blue economy .'
p9828
aS'i believe , as he does , that we should look at small island countries as large ocean states with vast potential .'
p9829
aS'we are pleased that sustainable use of oceans and marine resources is a distinct element in the sustainable development goals in the united nations that were finalised recently .'
p9830
aS'our bilateral agreement for cooperation on blue economy is a huge step forward in our relationship and in promoting sustainable ocean economy in the region .'

p9833
aS'we had spoken in march about improving connectivity .'
p9834
aS'the air services agreement today will enable more and easier connections between the two countries .'
p9835
aS'climate change is a major global challenge .'
p9836
aS'it is a serious threat to island countries like seychelles .'
p9837
aS'with a shoreline of 7500 kilometres and nearly 1300 islands , india has similar concerns .'
p9838
aS'we both have ambitious national plans for a more sustainable future .'
p9839
aS'we also work together for a comprehensive , balanced and effective outcome on climate change at cop 21 in paris later this year .'
p9840
aS'i shared our desire to press for reforms of the united nations , including its security council , in this 70th anniversary year .'
p9841
aS'we greatly appreciate seychelles support for indias candidature for permanent membership of an expanded united nations security council .'
p9842
aS'i also conveyed our desire to work with small island developing states to realise their vision of samoa pathway and to be a source of strength for each other in international forums .'
p9843
aS'i thank president michel for his support for the third india-africa forum summit to be held in october .'
p9844
aS'let me also express our gratitude to seychelles for their active support in making the international day of yoga a big success .'
p9845
aS'excellency , we are two nations of vastly different sizes .'
p9846
aS'but , this relationship is an outstanding model of international partnership .'
p9847
aS'this special and unique relationship will always be at the centre of our interests .'
p9848
aS'i am confident that this milestone year for our relationship will be the springboard for taking our strategic partnership to a new level .'
p9849
aS'thank you very much .'

S'thank you , shantanu , john , satya , paul , sunder , and venkatesha big thank you !'
p9852
aS'i am sure this was not pre-arranged .'

p9855
aS'partnership in the digital economy .'
p9856
aS'good evening , everyone !'
p9857
aS'if there was ever a gathering under one roof that could claim to be shaping the world , it is this .'
p9858
aS'and , i am not talking about those in public office , here or in india !'
p9859
aS'its a great pleasure to be here in california .'
p9860
aS'it is one of the last places in the world to see the sun set .'
p9861
aS'but , it is here that new ideas see the first light of the day .'
p9862
aS'its a great honour that you have joined us tonight .'
p9863
aS'i have met many of you in delhi and new york , and on facebook , twitter and instagram .'
p9864
aS'these are the new neighborhoods of our new world .'
p9865
aS'if facebook were a country , it would be the third most populous one and the most connected .'
p9866
aS'google today has made teachers less awe-inspiring and grandparents more idle .'
p9867
aS'twitter has turned everyone into a reporter .'
p9868
aS'the traffic lights that need to work the best are on cisco routers .'
p9869
aS'the status that now matters is not whether you are awake or asleep , but whether you are online or offline .'
p9870
aS'the most fundamental debate for our youth is the choice between android , ios or windows .'
p9871
aS'from computing to communication , entertainment to education , from printing documents to printing products , and , now to internet of things , its been a long journey in a short time .'
p9872
aS'from cleaner energy to better healthcare and safer transport , everything is converging around the work you do .'
p9873
aS'in africa , its helping people transfer money on phone .'
p9874
aS'it has made reaching small island states no longer a journey of adventure , but a convenient click of a mouse .'
p9875
aS'in india , a mother in a distant hill village has a better chance to save her new born infant .'
p9876
aS'a child in a remote village has better access to education .'
p9877
aS'a small farmer is more confident about his land holding and getting better market price .'
p9878
aS'a fisherman on the sea has a better catch .'
p9879
aS'and , a young professional in san francisco can skype daily to comfort her sick grandmother in india .'
p9880
aS"an initiative by a father in haryana for  selfie with daughter '' to draw attention to the girl child became an international movement ."
p9881
aS'all this is because of the work you people are doing .'
p9882
aS'since my government came to office last year , we have attacked poverty by using the power of networks and mobile phones to launch a new era of empowerment and inclusion : 180 million new bank accounts in a few months ; direct transfer of benefits to the poor ; funds for the unbanked ; insurance within the reach of the poorest ; and , pension for the sunset years for all .'
p9883
aS'by using space technology and internet , we have been able to identify in the last few months 170 applications that will make governance better and development faster .'
p9884
aS'when a small craftsman in a village in india brings a smile to a customer looking at his phone on a metro ride in new york ; when a heart patient in a remote hospital in kyrgyz republic is treated by doctors sitting in delhi , as i saw in bishkek , we know we are creating something that has fundamentally changed our lives .'
p9885
aS'the pace at which people are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age , education , language and income .'
p9886
aS'i like recounting my meeting with a group of unlettered tribal women in a remote part of gujarat .'
p9887
aS'they were present at a local milk chilling plant i was inaugurating .'
p9888
aS'they were using cell phones to take photographs of the event .'
p9889
aS'i asked them what they would do with the images .'
p9890
aS'the answer was a surprise for me .'
p9891
aS'they said , they would go back , have the images downloaded on to a computer and take printouts .'
p9892
aS'yes , they were familiar with the language of our digital world .'
p9893
aS'and , farmers in maharashtra state have created a whatsapp group to share information on farming practices .'
p9894
aS'customers , more than creators , are defining the use of a product .'
p9895
aS'the world may be driven by the same ancient impulses .'
p9896
aS'we will continue to see human struggles and successes .'
p9897
aS'we will witness human glory and tragedies .'
p9898
aS'but , in this digital age , we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago .'
p9899
aS'this is what sets us apart from the century that we have just left behind .'
p9900
aS'there may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich , educated and the privileged .'
p9901
aS'but , ask the taxi driver or the corner vendor in india what he has gained from his cell phone , and the debate gets settled .'
p9902
aS'i see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity .'
p9903
aS'social media is reducing social barriers .'
p9904
aS'it connects people on thestrength of human values , not identities .'
p9905
aS'today , technology is advancing citizen empowerment and democracy that once drew their strength from constitutions .'
p9906
aS'technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses , not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes .'
p9907
aS'when you think of the exponential speed and scale of expansion of social media or a service , you have to believe that it is equally possible to rapidly transform the lives of those who have long stood on the margins of hope .'
p9908
aS'so , friends out of this conviction was born the vision of digital india .'
p9909
aS'it is an enterprise for indias transformation on a scale that is , perhaps , unmatched in human history .'
p9910
aS'not just to touch the lives of the weakest , farthest and the poorest citizen of india , but change the way our nation will live and work .'
p9911
aS'for nothing else will do in a country with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years , impatient for change and eager to achieve it .'
p9912
aS'we will transform governance , making it more transparent , accountable , accessible and participative .'
p9913
aS'i spoke of e-governance as a foundation of better governance efficient , economical and effective .'
p9914
aS'i now speak of m-governance or mobile governance .'
p9915
aS'that is the way to go in a country with one billion cell phones and use of smart phones growing at high double digit rates .'
p9916
aS'it has the potential to make development a truly inclusive and comprehensive mass movement .'
p9917
aS'it puts governance within everyones reach .'
p9918
aS'after mygov .'
p9919
aS'in , i have just launched the narendra modi mobile app .'
p9920
aS'they are helping me stay in close touch with people .'
p9921
aS'i learn a great deal from their suggestions and complaints .'
p9922
aS'we want to free our citizens from the burden of excessive paper documents in every office .'
p9923
aS'we want paperless transactions .'
p9924
aS'we will set up a digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments .'
p9925
aS'we have set up ebiz portal to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient so that they concentrate their energy on their goals , not on government processes .'
p9926
aS'we are using technology to impart scale and speed to development .'
p9927
aS'information , education , skills , healthcare , livelihood , financial inclusion , small and village enterprises , opportunities for women , conservation of natural resources , distributed clean energy entirely new possibilities have emerged to change the development model .'
p9928
aS'but for all this , we must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy .'
p9929
aS'we must ensure that technology is accessible , affordable , and adds value .'
p9930
aS'we want our 1.'
p9931
aS'25 billion citizens to be digitally connected .'
p9932
aS'we already have broadband usage across india go up by 63 % last year .'
p9933
aS'we need to accelerate this further .'
p9934
aS'we have launched an aggressive expansion of the national optical fibre network that will take broadband to our 600,000 villages .'
p9935
aS'we will connect all schools and colleges with broadband .'
p9936
aS'building i-ways are as important as highways .'
p9937
aS'we are expanding our public wi-fi hotspots .'
p9938
aS'for example , we want to ensure that free wi fi is not only there in airport lounges , but also on our railway platforms .'
p9939
aS'teaming up with google , we will cover 500 railway stations in a short time .'
p9940
aS'we are also setting up common service centres in villages and towns .'
p9941
aS'we will also use information technology to build smart cities .'
p9942
aS'and , we want to turn our villages into smart economic hubs and connect our farmers better to markets and makes them less vulnerable to the whims of weather .'
p9943
aS'for me , access also means that content should be in local languages .'
p9944
aS'in a country with 22 official languages , it is a formidable , but an important task .'
p9945
aS'affordability of products and services is critical for our success .'
p9946
aS'there are many dimensions to this .'
p9947
aS'we will promote manufacture of quality and affordable products in india .'
p9948
aS'that is part of our vision of make in india , digital india and design in india .'
p9949
aS'as our economy and our lives get more wired , we are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security , intellectual property rights and cyber security .'
p9950
aS'and , i know to achieve the vision of digital india , the government must also start thinking a bit like you .'
p9951
aS'so , from creating infrastructure to services , from manufacture of products to human resource development , from support governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy , digital india is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you .'
p9952
aS'the task is huge ; the challenges are many .'
p9953
aS'but , we also know that we will not reach new destinations without taking new roads .'
p9954
aS'much of india that we dream of is yet to be built .'
p9955
aS'so , we have the opportunity to shape its path now .'
p9956
aS'and , we have the talent , enterprise and skills to succeed .'
p9957
aS'we also have the strength of the partnership between india and the united states .'
p9958
aS'indians and americans have worked together to shape the knowledge economy .'
p9959
aS'they have made us aware of the vast potential of technology .'
p9960
aS'from large corporate to young professionals in this great centre of innovation , each can be part of the digital india story .'
p9961
aS'the sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be a major force of good for our world and our planet .'
p9962
aS'today , we speak of india-u .'
p9963
aS's.'
p9964
aS'partnership as a defining partnership of this century .'
p9965
aS'it hinges on two major reasons .'
p9966
aS'both converge here in california .'
p9967
aS'we all know that the dynamic asia pacific region will shape the course of this century .'
p9968
aS'and , india and the united states , the worlds two largest democracies , are located at the two ends of this region .'
p9969
aS'we have the responsibility to shape a future of peace , stability and prosperity in this region .'
p9970
aS'our relationship is also defined by the power of youth , technology and innovation .'
p9971
aS'these can ignite a partnership that will advance and sustain prosperity in our two countries .'
p9972
aS'even more , in this digital age , we can draw on the strength of our values and partnership to shape a better and more sustainable future for the world .'

p9980
aS'of ethiopia , honble ministers from participating countries , representatives of development partners , friends from the civil society , the private sector , media , academia , national and international speakers and esteemed delegates .'
p9981
aS'on behalf of my government and all the co-hosts for this international summit , i warmly welcome you to theglobal call to action summit 2015.'
p9982
aS'this is a landmark occasion , as for the first time , the global call to action summit is being held outside usa .'
p9983
aS'my government is honoured to host this summit .'
p9984
aS'all those delegates who have travelled a long distance to attend this summit i heartily welcome you to india and to new delhi .'
p9985
aS'i am delighted to be with you this morning .'
p9986
aS'this two-day summit , celebrating the achievements of the participating countries in the area of maternal and child health , was conceptualized to accelerate joint leadership for ending preventable deaths among mothers and children .'
p9987
aS'it will showcase the power of new partnerships , innovations and systems to bring about improvements in life-saving interventions .'
p9988
aS'i firmly believe that this summit will provide a highly effective platform to address common challenges that willhelp us achieve the desired goals .'
p9989
aS'how we shape the world in the next 15 years will make the difference between prosperous , optimistic nations , and insecurity and unrest .'
p9990
aS'i am glad to see 24 nations present here to join together in their commitment to end preventable maternal and child death .'
p9991
aS'this is a call to action to all of us to seize this opportunity and think big .'
p9992
aS'today , as we gather here to discuss strategies and as we transit from the millennium development goals to sustainable development goals , let us acknowledge the sad reality that the world continues to lose about 289 thousand mothers and 6.'
p9993
aS'3 million under-5 children every year .'
p9994
aS'the 24 priority countries participating in the summit contribute nearly 70 % of the preventable maternal and child deaths .'
p9995
aS'for india , with its birth cohort of 26 million , the challenges are formidable butthe commitment to succeed is also as strong .'
p9996
aS'what , however , does offer hope is that most of these deaths can be prevented through simple yet effective and proven interventions .'
p9997
aS'this forms the key peg for this summit .'
p9998
aS'this also formed a crucial part of the joint statement issued subsequent to the visit of the us president in january this year , where we agreed to further accelerate the joint leadership to end all preventable maternal and child deaths .'
p9999
aS'keeping aside the work that still needs to be done , there have been significant achievements on the global front in the area of maternal and child health .'
p10000
aS'looking at the big picture , we find that in 1990 , indias under-five mortality rate stood at 126 while the global average was 90 .'
p10001
aS'in 2013 , this figure dropped to 49 against a global average of 46 .'
p10002
aS'therefore , the gap to the global average reduced from 36 points in 1990 , to just 3 points in 2013 reflecting that india has achievedunder-five mortality rate decline at an accelerated pace compared to global rate of decline .'
p10003
aS'what this translates into is this : india is likely to reach close to achieving the mdg target if the current trend of annual decline is sustained .'
p10004
aS'in addition to this remarkable achievement , another truly historic accomplishment has been the victory over polio .'
p10005
aS'india was declared as polio-free on 27 march 2014 .'
p10006
aS'from being a country which accounted for more than half of the global polio cases in 2009 , to being declared free of the wild polio virus : the journey reflects indias deep commitment to child health .'
p10007
aS'i am also happy to share with you today another major milestone achieved by india .'
p10008
aS'india has eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus .'
p10009
aS'the validation for this has happened much before the global target date of december 2015 .'
p10010
aS'this gives us the confidence to achieve other targets well before the target date .'
p10011
aS'to sustain the efforts of being a polio-free and maternal and neonatal tetanus free nation , and to accelerate the full immunization coverage in the country , my government has added to the worlds largest immunization drive another mission known as mission indradhanush .'
p10012
aS'it focusses on vaccinating the left-outs .'
p10013
aS'it also targets to accelerate the current increase in annual rate of immunization from existing 1 % to more than 5 % per year .'
p10014
aS'this will help us achieve more than 90 % coverage by2020 , which otherwise would take more than 25 years at the current pace .'
p10015
aS'the first phase has been successfully implemented .'
p10016
aS'we want to ensure that no child in india dies of a vaccine-preventable disease .'
p10017
aS'india has always partnered with the global efforts on issues of child and maternal health .'
p10018
aS'india is the first country to respond to the global commitment to reduce newborn mortality , subsequent to the launch of global every newborn action plan ( enap ) at the world health assembly in june 2014 .'
p10019
aS'india launched the india newborn action plan ( inap ) in september 2014 , targeting reduction in neonatal mortality rate ( nmr ) and still births to single digit by 2030 .'
p10020
aS'india also responded byacting on the first call to action through its commitment and launch of rmnch+a .'
p10021
aS'these remarkable successes in the field of maternal and child health have been possible through our national health mission ( nhm ) .'
p10022
aS'the mission , with its urban and rural health components perhaps one of the largest public health programmes in the world has resulted in improved health outcomes .'
p10023
aS'52 % of indias under-5 mortality is contributed to by deaths of newborns in the first month of life .'
p10024
aS'under the nhm , our approach emphasises a continuum of newborn care both at the communityand facility level .'
p10025
aS'our focus has been to get pregnant women to have safe delivery in our institutions .'
p10026
aS'we launched an ambitious program janani suraksha yojana ( jsy ) wherein incentives were given for delivering in public institutions to the beneficiaries directly .'
p10027
aS'as a result , today , more than 75 % of the deliveries take place in our institutions .'
p10028
aS'this has directly contributed to reduction in maternal mortality .'
p10029
aS'we are fully aware that out-of-pocket expenses remain a key barrier forwomen to access timely health care and services .'
p10030
aS'to overcome this , we have launched a programme called janani shishu suraksha karyakram ( jssk ) under which every woman delivering in a public health institution as well as the newborn is entitled to free and cashless health services , with an assured provision of free drugs , diagnostics and diet besides free to and fro transport .'
p10031
aS'this has helped to further improve our institutional deliveries .'
p10032
aS'not only are the mothers provided focused health services , but individual beneficiary tracking is being done through the countrywide maternal and child health tracking system , which ensures close tracking of inputs and outputs at the level of service provision .'
p10033
aS'more than 92 million mothers and 78 million children have already been registered so far in the system .'
p10034
aS'one of our major concerns is equity .'
p10035
aS'as a step towards ensuring equitable health services across regions that suffer from intra-state disparities , and to bring about sharper improvements in health outcomes , a total of 184 poorest performing districts all over the country have been identified .'
p10036
aS'special efforts are being made to put in more resources and focussed programmes in these areas .'
p10037
aS'one of the flagship programmes of my government is the swacch bharat abhiyaan ( the clean india campaign ) .'
p10038
aS'as a part of this large campaign , the health ministry has launched the kayakalp scheme to encourage public health facilities to maintain high standards of hygiene and sanitation , as i firmly believe that clean and hygienic environment is the stepping stone to a healthy nation .'
p10039
aS'to save and educate the girl child we have launched an ambitious program beti bachao beti padhao .'
p10040
aS'we need to ensure that the girl child survives , thrives and plays a very crucial role in society .'
p10041
aS'i have witnessed people getting poorer because of unfortunate health episodes .'
p10042
aS'we need to institutionalise a system where marginalised communities receive universal health care and financial protection .'
p10043
aS'we must experiment and learn from each other .'
p10044
aS'india stands ready to boost its commitment and partner with other countries and move forward on our promise to end maternal and child deaths and provide a better life to the adolescent .'
p10045
aS'i invite you , to commit to bold measures and holdeach other accountable to these promises .'
p10046
aS'as we assemble here , we need to send a very very strong message not only to ourselves , not only to the 24 countries present here , but to the entire world .'
p10047
aS'the message is of our commitment , that we will ensure that every woman , every child who can be saved will be saved .'
p10048
aS'we also need to make a clarion call to the world to join hands in taking such steps that would ensure this .'
p10049
aS'india stands committed to not only allocate resources towards this in our country , but also to helpthe world and all those countries which needed any support .'
p10050
aS'it is my personal vision and my governments firm commitment .'
p10051
aS'while every country present here has something to offer , india also has a wealth of experience .'
p10052
aS'india has done well in many ways and would be extremely happy to share its experience with other countries .'
p10053
aS'last year , i had made a commitment of assisting the saarc countries in keeping it polio free .'
p10054
aS'we have also made a commitment to provide pentavalent vaccines to such saarc countries as would need it .'
p10055
aS'we will offer whatever experience we have to the world community .'
p10056
aS'india would be happy to assist any country with technology , system strengthening and programme implementation capsules .'
p10057
aS'we could train personnel and skill them for better management of child sickness in our special newborn care units ( sncus ) as well as share our experience at home based new born care .'
p10058
aS'indias rich experience in universal immunization and particularly its experience this year with the mission indradhanush could be shared with all the countries .'
p10059
aS'we had offeredthis to saarc countries earlier .'
p10060
aS'today i repeat this offer to all countries present here .'
p10061
aS'this will be apart from our offer of support for polio eradication .'
p10062
aS'i again warmly welcome you all to this important international summit .'
p10063
aS'i hope the next two days would provide a new direction to the global community in its journey towards ending maternal and child deaths .'
p10064
aS'i wish you a pleasant stay in new delhi .'

aS'i have the opportunity to be amongst you to share my mann ki baat once again .'
p10070
aS'far south , the people are engrossed in onam festivities and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the holy festival of raksha bandhan .'
p10071
aS'the government of india has launched various schemes of social security for the common man .'
p10072
aS'i am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers .'
p10073
aS'i had made a humble request that on the occasion of raksha bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift .'
p10074
aS'the preliminary information that i have , notifies me that from launch till date around 11 crore families have joined this scheme .'
p10075
aS'and i have been told that almost half the beneficiaries are women , the mothers and the daughters .'
p10076
aS'i consider this as a positive sign .'
p10077
aS'i offer my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on this blessed occasion of raksha bandhan .'
p10078
aS'today when i talk to you , i want to mention that around a year back the jan dhan yojana was started at a large scale .'
p10079
aS'a task which could not be achieved in the past 60 years , would it be possible to achieve it in such a small span of time ?'
p10080
aS'many questions were being raised but i am happy to tell you that all the units of the government and all the banks put in tremendous effort and as per my knowledge till date close to 18 crore people have opened their bank accounts , 17 crore 74lakh to be precise .'

aS'but these poor people saved money and deposited a sum of 22,000 crores .'
p10084
aS'banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the poor , the programme of bank mitra is being strengthened .'
p10085
aS'today more than 1.'
p10086
aS'25 lakh bank mitras are serving in the country .'
p10087
aS'the youth have got employment this way .'
p10088
aS'you will be pleased to know that in this one year to connect thebanking sector , economy and the poor people , over 1 lakh 31 thousand financial literacy camps have been organized .'
p10089
aS'one just does not have to open account and get stuck .'
p10090
aS'thousands of people under the jan dhan yojana are now eligible to take an overdraft and they have availed it too .'
p10091
aS'now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank .'
p10092
aS'i would again like to congratulate all the people associated with this initiative and i would like to request the poor brethrenwho have opened an account to never severe this relationship .'
p10093
aS'these are your banks and now you should never leave them .'
p10094
aS'i have brought them to you , now it is your job to keep them going .'
p10095
aS'all of our accounts should be kept active .'
p10096
aS'i have the faith that you will definitely continue operating the bank accounts .'
p10097
aS'in the past few days the events in gujarat , the violence unsettled the entire country .'
p10098
aS'it is natural that if something of this sort happens in the land of mahatma and sardar patel , then the nation is definitely shocked and hurt .'
p10099
aS'but in a very short span of time , the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in gujarat brought the entire situation under control .'
p10100
aS'they played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again gujarat started its peaceful march .'
p10101
aS'peace , unity and brotherhood is the right way forward .'
p10102
aS'we have to walk together towards the path of development .'
p10103
aS'development is the key to our problems .'
p10104
aS'sometime back , i had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the sufi tradition .'
p10105
aS'i had the opportunity to hear them speak .'
p10106
aS'and truly speaking of the experience and the manner in which they presented their views sounded as if some music was being played .'
p10107
aS'their choice of words , their way of talking , the generosity of the sufi tradition , its sublimity , its lyricism , i could experience it all .'
p10108
aS'i felt very nice .'
p10109
aS'i think it has become imperative to present islam in its true form to the world .'
p10110
aS'i amconfident that the sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit islam .'
p10111
aS'and i would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows , we should definitely experience sufism once .'
p10112
aS'i am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and i consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation .'
p10113
aS'various buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at bodh gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level .'
p10114
aS'i have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and i am glad to be invited at bodh gaya .'
p10115
aS'pandit nehru , the first prime minister of india visited bodh gaya .'
p10116
aS'and now , i will be going there with these scholars , thisgives me immense happiness .'
p10117
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters , today i would again like to especially share my mann ki baat with you .'
p10118
aS'i have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of mann ki baat .'
p10119
aS'you must have heard me speak in the parliament , in public forums or mann ki baat about it .'
p10120
aS'i have always said that the government is open to all views and suggestions on the issue of land acquisition act , on which a debate is going on .'
p10121
aS'i have reiterated again and again that i am open to any suggestion in theinterest of the farmers .'
p10122
aS'but today , i want to tell all my farmer brothers and sisters that the request to reform the land acquisition act was raised by the states very emphatically .'
p10123
aS'everyone felt that if the welfare of the farmers is to be achieved , if the water has to reach the fields , if poles are to be erected to provide electricity , if roads have to be constructed in the village , if houses are to be made for the poor in the village , if employment opportunities are to beprovided to the poor youth of rural areas then we have to free the land from legal hassles and bureaucratic hurdles .'
p10124
aS'and hence this reformed proposal was introduced .'
p10125
aS'but i saw how the framers were being misled and a fear psychosis created .'
p10126
aS'my dear farmers , you should not be misled and definitely never be scared .'
p10127
aS'and i do not wish to give anyone the opportunity to mislead you and scare you .'
p10128
aS'for me , every single voice in the nation is important but most important to me is the voice of thefarmer .'
p10129
aS'we had issued an ordinance .'
p10130
aS'tomorrow , on august 31st the deadline for this ordinance ends .'
p10131
aS'i have decided that let this ordinance be lapsed .'
p10132
aS'this means that now same situation exists as it was prior to the formation of my government .'
p10133
aS'but in the same act , there was a job which was incomplete .'
p10134
aS'this job was related to 13 points which were to be completed within a year and so we brought the ordinance , but due to these disputes the issue got stuck .'
p10135
aS'the ordinance is coming toan end but those 13 points which were to benefit farmers which is directly connected to the monetary issues of the farmers will be made into a law and will be implemented today itself so that the farmers do not suffer any losses , especially monetary losses .'
p10136
aS'and hence the task of implementing the 13 points which was left incomplete in the earlier act is being accomplished today .'
p10137
aS'i want to reassure my farmer brothers and sisters that jai jawan jai kisan is not merely a slogan , itis our guiding mantra .'
p10138
aS'the guiding mantra is the welfare of the villages and the poor farmers .'
p10139
aS'that is why i declared on 15th august that it is not just an agricultural department but an agricultural and farmer welfare department will be created .'
p10140
aS'we are steadily working on it .'
p10141
aS'so my dear farmers there is no need to be misled now and especially there is no need for you to fear anything .'
p10142
aS'do not be scared even if someone tries to scare you .'
p10143
aS'i have to say something more .'
p10144
aS'two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war .'
p10145
aS'and whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember lal bahadur shastri .'
p10146
aS'it is also but natural that we remember his slogan jai jawan jai kisan .'
p10147
aS'it is also natural that we remember our jawans who sacrificed their lives to maintain the pride and honour of our tricolor flag .'
p10148
aS'i salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war .'
p10149
aS'i pay my tribute to the brave soldiers .'
p10150
aS'maywe continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history .'
p10151
aS'like i had the chance of meeting the sufi scholars similarly i had another great experience .'
p10152
aS'i had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country .'
p10153
aS'i had the opportunity to hear them and i was very happy to know that india is doing commendable research in the field of science .'
p10154
aS'our scientists are doing some excellent work .'
p10155
aS'now the challenge is to take these researches to the common man .'
p10156
aS'how to convert these theories into machineries ?'
p10157
aS'how toconnect laboratory to the land ?'
p10158
aS'we have to take this forward as an opportunity .'
p10159
aS'i got a lot of new information .'
p10160
aS'i can say that it was both inspiring and educative experience for me .'
p10161
aS'and i saw how the young scientists were eager to explain their work and their eyes were full of dreams .'
p10162
aS'in the previous episode of mann ki baat i had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science .'
p10163
aS'after this meeting i felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities .'
p10164
aS'i would like to reiterate once again that our young friends take interest in science and our educational institutions should also encourage the students for the same .'
p10165
aS'i receive many letters from the citizens .'
p10166
aS'mr parimal shah from thane talks about educational reforms on my portal mygov .'
p10167
aS'in .'
p10168
aS'they have written about skill development .'
p10169
aS'mr prakash tripathi from chidambaram in tamil nadu emphasizes the need for good teachers at primary level .'
p10170
aS'they have emphasized on reforms in the educational set ups .'
p10171
aS'i especially want to make a point to my young friends .'
p10172
aS'i had mentioned from the red fort that why should there be interviews for the lower posts .'
p10173
aS'and when they do get the interview letter - the poor , the widowed mother start thinking who to reach for recommendation , who can help get the job , whose jack could be useful to get that job .'
p10174
aS'i do not know what all kind of words are being used ?'
p10175
aS'every one rushes and that seems to be one reason for corruption at the lower levels .'
p10176
aS'ihad mentioned in my speech on 15th august 2015 that this tradition of interview should at least end at some level .'
p10177
aS'i am happy that in such a short span of time , it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace .'
p10178
aS'information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews .'
p10179
aS'now the poor will not have to run for recommendation .'
p10180
aS'this will end exploitation and corruption .'
p10181
aS'these days many guests from foreign countries have arrived in india .'
p10182
aS'24 countries from across the globe discussed on the indian soil a call to action to reduce maternal mortality and infant mortality rates .'
p10183
aS'it was the first time that this programme was organized in any other country outside america .'
p10184
aS'and it is true that in our country about 50,000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year .'
p10185
aS'this is a cause of worry andthese figures are scary .'
p10186
aS'although a lot of improvement has taken place .'
p10187
aS'india is being appreciated at the international level for its efforts but this statistics is not low .'
p10188
aS'like we became polio free similarly we became free from tetanus as a cause of maternal and child mortality .'
p10189
aS'the world has accepted this .'
p10190
aS'but we still have to work to save our mothers and our children .'
p10191
aS'dear countrymen , there is news of dengue everywhere .'
p10192
aS'it is true that dengue is dangerous but prevention of dengue is easier .'
p10193
aS'it is directly related to the swatch bharat campaign that i talk about .'
p10194
aS'we watch the advertisement on tv but do not pay attention .'
p10195
aS'there are advertisements in the newspapers but it escapes our attention .'
p10196
aS'there are several ways of keeping the smallest thing in the household clean by using pure water .'
p10197
aS'a lot of public education programmes are beingconducted but we do not pay attention .'
p10198
aS'we feel that we live in very good houses with proper arrangements being totally unaware that water is collecting at some location in the house and that we are inviting dengue .'
p10199
aS'i would request you all that do not make death so cheap .'
p10200
aS'life is very precious .'
p10201
aS'a little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death , which i believe is not right .'
p10202
aS'in the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue casesabsolutely free of cost .'
p10203
aS'it is necessary to get ourselves tested on time to save precious lives .'
p10204
aS'cooperation from all of you is very important for this menace .'
p10205
aS'and cleanliness should be given great importance .'
p10206
aS'from raksha bandhan to diwali there will be many festivals .'
p10207
aS'why dont we associate each festival with cleaniness ?'
p10208
aS'you will see how a tradition becomes your habit .'
p10209
aS'my dear countrymen i want to share good news with you .'
p10210
aS'like i said we may not get a chance to die for our nation , but we can be fortunate to live for the country .'
p10211
aS'there are two young brothers and that too from nashik in our own state of maharashtra .'
p10212
aS'dr.'
p10213
aS'hitendra mahajan and dr.'
p10214
aS'mahendra mahajan , both with a keen desire to help our tribal population .'
p10215
aS'these two brothers have brought pride to the nation .'
p10216
aS'in america a difficult cycle race of about 4800 kms known as race across america isorganized .'
p10217
aS'this year both these brothers have won this race .'
p10218
aS'they have made us proud .'
p10219
aS'i would like to congratulate both these brothers and send my best wishes .'
p10220
aS'but i was happier to know that they do all this for their campaign team india vision for tribals .'
p10221
aS'see everyone is doing their bit for taking the country forward .'
p10222
aS'and this it , when you hear such things the heart swells with pride .'
p10223
aS'sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception .'
p10224
aS'the old generation feels that the new generation does not understand anything and i understand that this has been going on for ages .'
p10225
aS'my experience regarding youth is different .'
p10226
aS'sometimes when we talk to the youth we learn so many things .'
p10227
aS'i have met so many youth who have taken the pledge sunday on cycle .'
p10228
aS'some say that i keep one day a week as cycle-day as it is good for my health .'
p10229
aS'it is good for theenvironment .'
p10230
aS'and i enjoy my youth too .'
p10231
aS'nowadays many cities in our country are witnessing cycle use and there are many people promoting its use .'
p10232
aS'but this is a good initiative both for improving health and saving the environment .'
p10233
aS'and today when two youths of my country made india proud in the us , i thought of it worth mentioning .'
p10234
aS'today i especially want to congratulate the maharashtra government .'
p10235
aS'it makes me happy .'
p10236
aS'the task for erecting a memorial for baba sahib ambedkar in the indu mill compounds had been stuck for long .'
p10237
aS'the new government in maharashtra completed this task and now a grand memorial will be erected which will inspire us to work for the dalits , exploited and the marginalized .'
p10238
aS'but along with this , the house in uk where baba saheb lived 10 king henry road has been purchased too .'
p10239
aS'theglobetrotting indians on their trip to uk can visit the memorial being erected by the maharashtra government .'
p10240
aS'it will be inspirational to many .'
p10241
aS'i congratulate the maharashtra government on the accomplishment of both these tasks .'
p10242
aS'my dear brothers and sisters do share your views before the next mann ki baat for i believe that democracy runs through public participation .'
p10243
aS'we can take the nation forward when we work together .'
p10244
aS'i send my best wishes to you .'

aS'thank you .'

p10251
aS'this is truly an esteemed gathering of spiritual leaders , scholars and leaders from several countries of the world where buddhism is a prevalent way of life .'
p10252
aS'it is a matter of immense happiness that this conference is being held in india , including in bodh gaya .'
p10253
aS'india is the ideal venue to host a symposium of this nature .'
p10254
aS'we in india are proud of the fact that it was from this land that gautama buddha gave the world the tenets of buddhism .'
p10255
aS'the life of gautama buddha illustrates the power of service , compassion and , most importantly , renunciation .'
p10256
aS'he was born into privilege .'
p10257
aS'the hardships he faced were relatively fewer .'
p10258
aS'yet , with age grew a distinct consciousness about human suffering , about illness , about old age and about death .'
p10259
aS'he was convinced that material wealth is not the sole goal .'
p10260
aS'human conflicts repulsed him .'
p10261
aS'and then , he set out , on the path to create a peaceful and compassionate society .'
p10262
aS'in those days , he had the courage and conviction to hold a mirror to the society , and sought to break free from practices and systems seen as regressive .'
p10263
aS'gautam buddha was a revolutionary .'
p10264
aS'he nurtured a faith where a human being is at the core , nothing else .'
p10265
aS'the innermost being of man manifests godliness .'
p10266
aS'in a way , he created a faith without god , and a faith where divinity is not about looking anywhere outside , but about looking within .'
p10267
aS'in three words , appa deepo bhavah ( ) or be your own light , gautam buddha gave humanity the greatest management lesson .'
p10268
aS'nothing pained him more than mindless conflict that caused humansuffering .'
p10269
aS'non-violence was integral to his worldview .'
p10270
aS'the message and teachings of gautama buddha resonate loudly and clearly with the major themes chosen for this symposium the themes of avoiding conflicts , moving towards environmental consciousness and a concept of free and frank dialogue .'
p10271
aS'the three themes may appear independent but they are not mutually exclusive .'
p10272
aS'infact , they are mutually dependent and supportive .'
p10273
aS'the conflict in the first theme is among humans , religions , communities and nation-states , also between non-state actors and states , and even the world .'
p10274
aS'intolerant non-state actors now control large territories where they are unleashing barbaric violence on innocent people .'
p10275
aS'the second conflict is between nature and man , between nature and development , and also between nature and science .'
p10276
aS'these types of conflicts call for dialogue to bring about conflict avoidance not just give and take conflict resolution negotiations as what is happening today .'
p10277
aS'ethical values of personal restraint in consumption and environmental consciousness are deeply rooted in asian philosophical traditions , especially in hinduism and buddhism .'
p10278
aS'buddhism , along with other faiths , such as confucianism , taoism and shintoism , has undertaken greater responsibility to protect the environment .'
p10279
aS'hinduism and buddhism with their well-defined treatises on mother earth can help examine the changes in approach that need to be made .'
p10280
aS'climate change is a pressing global challenge .'
p10281
aS'it calls for a collective human action and a comprehensive response .'
p10282
aS'in india , faith and nature have had a deep link since ancient times .'
p10283
aS'buddhism and environment are deeply co-related .'
p10284
aS'the buddhist tradition , in all of its historical and cultural manifestations , encourages greater identification with the natural world because from a buddhist perspective nothing has a separate existence .'
p10285
aS'the impurities in the environment affect the mind , and the impurities of mind also pollute the environment .'
p10286
aS'in order to purify the environment , we have to purify the mind .'
p10287
aS'the eco crisis , in fact , is a reflection of imbalance of mind .'
p10288
aS'lord buddha , therefore , accorded importance to the need for preserving natural resources , and created tools related to water conservation and forbid the monks from polluting water resources .'
p10289
aS'the nature , forests , trees and the well-being of all beings play a great role in the teachings of lord buddha .'
p10290
aS'i wrote a book convenient action which was released by the former president of india , dr.'
p10291
aS'apj abdul kalam .'
p10292
aS'in my book i have shared my experiences of dealing with climate change as the chief minister .'
p10293
aS'personally , it is my reading of vedic literature that educated me about the strong bond between humans and mother nature .'
p10294
aS'we are all aware of mahatma gandhis doctrine of trusteeship .'
p10295
aS'in this context , i want to say that we , the present generation , have the responsibility to act as a trustee of the rich natural wealth for the future generations .'
p10296
aS'the issue is not merely about climate change ; it is about climate justice .'
p10297
aS'again i repeat is not the issue of climate change , it is about climate justice .'
p10298
aS'in my view , the most adversely affected by climate change are the poor and the downtrodden .'
p10299
aS'when a natural disaster strikes , they are hit the hardest .'
p10300
aS'when there are floods , they are rendered homeless ; during a quake , their homes are destroyed ; during droughts , they are affected ; and during extreme cold too , the homeless suffer the most .'
p10301
aS'we cant let climate change keep affecting people in this manner .'
p10302
aS'which is why i believe the discourse must shift focus from climate change to climate justice .'
p10303
aS'the third theme promotion of dialogue calls for a shift from ideological approach to a philosophic one .'
p10304
aS'without proper dialogue , neither of the two themes of conflict avoidance is possible , or workable .'
p10305
aS'the severe limitations in our conflict resolution mechanisms are becoming more and more obvious .'
p10306
aS'we need significant , collective and strategic efforts to prevent bloodshed and violence .'
p10307
aS'it is , thus , no surprise that the world is taking note of buddhism .'
p10308
aS'this is also a recognition of the historical asian traditions and values , which can be used to shift the paradigm to conflict avoidance , to move from the path of ideology to philosophy .'
p10309
aS'the essence of the entire concept of this conference including the first two themes conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness is contained in the dialogue part of it which calls for a shift from the them vs us ideological approach to philosophic approach .'
p10310
aS'it is necessary to inform the world about the need to shift from ideology whether religious or secular to philosophy .'
p10311
aS'when i spoke at the unite nations last year , i briefly mentioned that the world needs toshift from ideological approach to philosophic approach .'
p10312
aS'a day later when i addressed the council for foreign relations , i expanded on this concept a little more .'
p10313
aS'the essence of philosophy is that it is not a closed thought , while ideology is a closed one .'
p10314
aS'so philosophy not only allows dialogue but it is perpetual search of truth through dialogue .'
p10315
aS'the entire upanishad literature is a compilation of dialogue .'
p10316
aS'ideology only believes in unabated truth .'
p10317
aS'so ideologies which close the gatesfor dialogue have the propensity for violence while philosophy seeks to avoid it though dialogue .'
p10318
aS'thus , hindu and buddhist religions are in that sense more philosophies and not just belief systems .'
p10319
aS'it is my firm belief that the solution to all problems lies in dialogue .'
p10320
aS'earlier , it was believed that force indicates power .'
p10321
aS'now , power must come through the strength of ideas and the effective dialogue .'
p10322
aS'we have seen the adverse effects of war .'
p10323
aS'the first half of the 20th century was witness to the horrors of two world wars .'
p10324
aS'now , nature of warfare is changing and the dangers are increasing .'
p10325
aS'what took a hundred thousand men or a prolonged battle can now happen through the click of a button , in a span of minutes .'
p10326
aS'all of us here have a cardinal duty to ensure that our future generations lead a life of peace , dignity and mutual respect .'
p10327
aS'we need to sow the seeds of a conflict-free world and , in this endeavour , faiths of buddhism and hinduism have a great contribution .'
p10328
aS'when we talk about dialogue , what kind of dialogue should it be ?'
p10329
aS'it is dialogue which produces no anger or retribution .'
p10330
aS'one of the greatest examples of such dialogue was the one between adi sankara and mandana mishra .'
p10331
aS'it is worth recalling and describing this ancient example for our modern times .'
p10332
aS'adi sankara , a vedantic who did not give high marks for rituals , was a young man , while mandana mishra was an elderly scholar and high ritualist who believed even in animal sacrifice .'
p10333
aS'adi sankara wanted to establish through dialogue and debate with the highest authority on ritualism and that rituals were not necessary for attaining mukti , while mandana mishra wanted to prove that sankara was wrong in dismissing rituals .'
p10334
aS'this was how , in ancient india , debates on sensitive issues between scholars avoided such issues being settled in streets .'
p10335
aS'adi sankara and mandana mishra held a debate and sankara won .'
p10336
aS'but the more important point is not the debate itself but how was the debate was conducted .'
p10337
aS'it is a fascinating story that will ever remain one of the highest forms of debate for all times for humanity .'
p10338
aS'it was agreed that if mandana mishra lost , he would cease to be a householder ( gruhasta ) and accept sanyasa .'
p10339
aS'if adi sankara lost , he would give up his sanyasa and marry and settle down as householder or in gruhasta life .'
p10340
aS'mandana mishra , a high scholar , offered to adi sankara , who was young and therefore mishra considered unequal , to choose a referee of his choice .'

aS'adi sankara chose mandana mishras wife , a scholar herself , as the referee !'
p10342
aS'if mandana mishra lost , she would lose her husband !'
p10343
aS'but see what she did !'
p10344
aS'she asked both sankar and mishra to wear fresh garlands and then begin the debate , and said that the one whose garland loses its freshness would be declared as the loser !'
p10345
aS'why ?'
p10346
aS'because if one gets angry , the body will develop heat , and , as a result , the garland flowers will lose their freshness in that heat .'
p10347
aS'anger within is a sign of defeat .'
p10348
aS'on this logic , mandana mishra was declared as having lost the debate !'
p10349
aS'and he accepted sanyas and became a disciple of sankara .'
p10350
aS'this demonstrates the vitality of dialogue and that too dialogue without anger or conflict .'
p10351
aS'today , in this august gathering , we are people of different nationalities , with different lifestyles , but what binds us is the fact that the roots of our civilisations are in our shared philosophies , history and heritage .'
p10352
aS'buddhism and buddhist heritage have been a uniting and binding factor .'
p10353
aS'they say that this century is going to be an asian century .'
p10354
aS'i am very clear that without embracing the path and ideals shown by gautam buddha , this century can not be an asian century !'
p10355
aS'i see lord buddha doing to our collective spiritual well-being what global trade did to our collective economic well-being and the digital internet did to our collective intellectual well-being .'
p10356
aS'i see lord buddha in the 21st century across national borders , across faith systems , across political ideologies , playing the role of a bridge to promote understanding to counsel patience and to enlighten us with tolerance and empathy .'
p10357
aS'you are visiting a nation that is extremely proud of its buddhist heritage .'
p10358
aS'my hometown of vadnagar in gujarat is one of the many sites where buddhist relics were found and was one of the places visited by chinese traveller and chronicler , xuanzang .'
p10359
aS'the saarc region is home to the holy sites of buddhism ; lumbini , bodh gaya , sarnath , kushinagar .'
p10360
aS'these sites draw pilgrims from asean nations , as also from china , korea , japan , mongolia and russia .'
p10361
aS'my government is doing everything possible to give an impetus to this buddhist heritage across india , and india is taking the lead in boosting the buddhist heritage across asia .'
p10362
aS'this three-day meet is one such effort .'
p10363
aS'i hope the next three days are full of vibrant and rich discussions , and we are able to sit together and think about the way ahead towards peace , conflict resolution and a clean and green world .'
p10364
aS'i look forward to seeing you in bodh gaya the day after .'
p10365
aS'thank you .'

p10369
aS'i feel very blessed to be here at bodh gaya .'
p10370
aS'after pandit jawaharlal nehru and atal bihari vajpayee , i have the opportunity to visit this sacred place .'
p10371
aS'i am meeting you all on a very special day .'
p10372
aS'today , we in india are observing teachers day , to commemorate the birth anniversary of our 2nd president , a great scholar and teacher , dr.'
p10373
aS'sarvepalli radhakrishnan .'
p10374
aS'in this symposium we have been talking about one of the most impactful teachers in world history , gautama buddha .'
p10375
aS'his teachings have inspired millions of people over centuries .'
p10376
aS'today , we are also celebrating janmashtami , the day lord krishna was born .'
p10377
aS'the world has so much to learn from lord krishna .'
p10378
aS'when we talk about lord krishna we say , -shri krishna , the teacher of all teachers ; the guru of all gurus .'
p10379
aS'both , gautama buddha and lord krishna have taught the world so much .'
p10380
aS'the themes of this conference , in a way are inspired by the values and ideals given by these two greats .'
p10381
aS'shri krishna gave his message before the start of the great war in the mahabharata and lord buddha repeatedly emphasized on rising above warfare .'
p10382
aS'the message by both of them was about establishing dharma .'
p10383
aS'both of them gave great prominence to principles and processes .'
p10384
aS'gautama buddha gave the eight-fold path and the panchsheel .'
p10385
aS'while shri krishna gave invaluable lessons of life in the form of karma yoga .'
p10386
aS'these two divine souls had the strength to bring people together , rising above differences .'
p10387
aS'their teachings are most practical , eternal and are more relevant in this day and age than ever before .'
p10388
aS'the place where we are meeting makes it even more special .'
p10389
aS'we are meeting in bodh gaya , a land that has a distinctive place in the history of humankind .'
p10390
aS'this is the land of enlightenment .'
p10391
aS'years ago , what bodh gaya got was siddhartha but what bodh gaya gave to the world was lord buddha , the epitome of knowledge , peace and compassion .'
p10392
aS'this is , therefore the ideal venue for a dialogue and meeting here on the auspicious day of janmashtami and the special day of teachers day makes this unique .'
p10393
aS'it was my great privilege to have participated in the inaugural function of the first international hindu buddhist initiative on conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness hosted by the vivekananda international foundation and tokyo foundation with the support of the international buddhist confederation at delhi day before yesterday .'
p10394
aS'the conference was conceptualised on shifting the paradigm from conflict resolution to conflict avoidance and from environmental regulation to environmental consciousness .'
p10395
aS'i had shared some of my thoughts on the two critical themes which are threatening humanity as no other challenge before .'
p10396
aS'i recalled how in the context of both issues and for changing the global paradigm of thinking the world is looking to the buddha today as conflict resolution mechanisms and environmental regulations both of them dependent on the instrumentality of nation states are increasingly failing to measure up to challenges .'
p10397
aS'spiritual and religious leaders and also intellectuals , largely from buddhist societies participated in the two day conference and deliberated on the two issues .'
p10398
aS'at the end of the two day conference , and after a churning in which spiritual , religious and intellectual leaders participated , the tokyo foundation has announced that they have decided to hold a similar conference in january 2016 .'
p10399
aS'and other buddhist nations have also offered to hold similar conferences in theircountries .'
p10400
aS'this is an extraordinary development which coincides with the rise of asia as an economic and civilisational phenomenon .'
p10401
aS'the themes of the conference , informed and shaped by the hindu-buddhist civilisational and cultural perspectives , promise to deepen the notion of conflict avoidance philosophy and environmental consciousness in asia and beyond .'
p10402
aS'the two day conference seems to have arrived at a broad consensus on both issues .'
p10403
aS'on the issue of conflicts most of which are being driven by religious intolerance the participants in the conference seem to have agreed that while there is no problem about the freedom to practise ones religion , it is when the radical elements try to force their own ideologies on others , that the potential for conflict arises .'
p10404
aS'on the issue of environment , the conference seems to have agreedthat the philosophic underpinning of the dharma , which stresses the protection of natural heritage , is critical for sustainable development .'
p10405
aS'i may add that the united nations too has arrived at the view that sustainable development is achievable only through aligning development to the local culture of the people .'
p10406
aS'this , in my view , is a positive turn in the development modelling of the world of diversity .'
p10407
aS'i may add that the turn in thinking at the global level has created the eco-system for the hindu-buddhist societies to carry forward their consensual ideas to the global fora .'
p10408
aS'i personally consider the hindu buddhist conference on conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness as an important development in a world that seems to be short of durable ideas on both issues .'
p10409
aS'hindu philosophy was one of the greatest beneficiaries of the advent and the teachings of the lord buddha .'
p10410
aS'many scholars have analysed the impact of buddha on hinduism .'
p10411
aS"in fact , adi sankara was even critiqued for the way he was influenced by the buddha and sankara was called as prachhanna boudha '' meaning sankara was buddha in disguised form ."
p10412
aS'that was the extent of influence of the buddha on adi sankara , regarded by many as the tallest hindu philosopher .'
p10413
aS'at the mass level buddha was so venerated that jayadeva in his geeta govinda even praised him as mahavishnu or god himself whodescended to preach ahimsa .'
p10414
aS'so , hinduism after the buddhas advent became buddhist hinduism or hindu buddhism .'
p10415
aS'they are today an inseparable amalgam .'
p10416
aS'this is how swami vivekananda praised buddha .'
p10417
aS'i quote : at the time buddha was born , india was in need of a great spiritual leader , a prophet .'
p10418
aS'buddha never bowed down to anything , neither veda , nor caste , nor priest , nor custom .'
p10419
aS'he fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him .'
p10420
aS'such a fearless search for truth and such love for every living thing the world has never seen .'
p10421
aS'buddha was more brave and sincere than any teacher .'
p10422
aS'buddha was the first human being to give to this world a complete system of morality .'
p10423
aS'he was good for goods sake , he loved for loves sake .'
p10424
aS'buddha was the great preacher of equality .'
p10425
aS'every man and woman has the same right to attain spirituality that was his teaching .'
p10426
aS'i would personally call india buddhist india as it has imbibed all the values and virtues of the teachings of buddha by their religious scholars incorporating them in their literature .'
p10427
aS'when this highest tribute is paid by one of the great hindu philosophers would it be wrong to call todays hinduism in quality and substance as buddhist hinduism ?'
p10428
aS'buddha is the crown jewel of the indian nation which accepts all ways of worship of all religions .'
p10429
aS'this quality of hinduism in india was a product of many great spiritual masters chief among them was buddha .'
p10430
aS'and this is what sustains the secular character of india .'
p10431
aS'the enlightenment which buddha attained in bodh gaya also lit the light of enlightenment in hinduism .'
p10432
aS'as the first servant of this ancient nation i revere buddha as a reformer of not only hinduism but also the world , who has given all of us a new world view and vision which is critical for the survival of all of us and the entire world .'
p10433
aS'i recognise how buddhists all over the world revere bodh gaya as a place of pilgrimage .'
p10434
aS'we in india would like to develop bodh gaya so that it can become the spiritual capital and civilisational bond between india and the buddhist world .'
p10435
aS'the government of india would like to provide all possible support that its buddhist cousin nations need for the satisfaction of their spiritual needs from this holiest of holy places for them .'
p10436
aS'i am happy to read the declaration of buddhist religions and spiritual leaders .'
p10437
aS'this declaration is the result of hardwork and extensive dialogue , which is why it is a pioneering document that will show us the way ahead .'
p10438
aS'i also echo prime minister shinzo abe of japan , who the other day highlighted the importance of tolerance , appreciation of diversity , and spirit of compassion and fraternity .'
p10439
aS'his message to this august gathering and his continuous support forfurthering this initiative is a matter of great strength for us .'
p10440
aS'once again , my congratulations and best wishes to you all .'
p10441
aS'this conference has raised a hope and urge to go beyond clash and create a dialogue framework for civilizational harmony and world peace .'
p10442
aS'i wish you well in your constant and determined efforts to ensure that our wisdom reaches the future generations and that too in a manner in which they can practically relate to .'
p10443
aS'this is essential not for us or them but for the progress of the entire human race and the beautiful surroundingswhich we have got from mother nature .'
p10444
aS'thank you very much .'
p10445
aS'thanks a lot .'

p10456
aS'i had the privilege of an extraordinary visit to sri lanka in march .'
p10457
aS'now , we have prime minister wickremesinghe here .'
p10458
aS'sri lanka has voted twice this year for change , reforms , reconciliation and progress .'
p10459

p10465
aS'your progress is important for our two countries , south asia and our maritime region .'
p10466
aS'prime minister and i had excellent discussions today .'
p10467
aS'we welcomed some significant developments in bilateral relations since march , including the currency swap arrangement .'
p10468
aS'we also expressed hope that progress on key bilateral initiatives and projects will gather speed now .'
p10469
aS'we both want deeper economic engagement .'
p10470
aS'we would like to see our trade grow and become more balanced for sri lanka .'
p10471
aS'we discussed how we can achieve these goals in a more open and competitive indian market , including through bilateral arrangements for trade and investments .'
p10472
aS'i also sought his support for indian investors , who are keen to participate in sri lankas economic development , especially in infrastructure , energy and transport sectors .'
p10473
aS'i offered indias full support to strengthen connectivity between our two countries to deepen human and economic links that will benefit all sections of our societies .'
p10474
aS'i assured prime minister wickremesinghe of continuing commitment to our development partnership - in infrastructure , railways , energy , community development projects , agriculture , capacity building , science and technology , space and civil nuclear field .'
p10475
aS'we will continue to nurture people-to-people ties .'

aS'prime minister and i also discussed the fishermen issue .'
p10483
aS'we agreed that fishermens associations on both sides should continue their efforts to find a solution .'
p10484
aS'i conveyed to him that this should be seen as a humanitarian issue that affects livelihoods .'
p10485
aS'i informed him of the steps we are taking to encourage indian fishermen to take up deep sea fishing .'
p10486
aS'in conclusion , let me say that india and sri lanka have a huge stake in each others success , and in stability and development in our region .'
p10487
aS'this is a relationship that touches the hearts of ordinary indians and sri lankans .'
p10488
aS'it is also of great strategic importance to our two countries .'
p10489
aS'with president sirisena and prime minister wickremesinghe , we can look to the future with great optimism .'
p10490
aS'thank you .'
p10491
aa(lp10492
S'my dear countrymen , greetings to you all .'
p10493
aS'this is the twelfth episode of mann ki baat and in a way it means that we have completed one year .'
p10494
aS'last year on 3rd october i had an opportunity to conduct my first ever mann ki baat .'
p10495
aS'mann ki baat one year , many thoughts .'
p10496
aS'i am not sure of what you gained , but i can certainly say that i gained a lot .'
p10497
aS'in a democracy the power of the people is of great significance .'
p10498
aS'this thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why i have immense faith in the power of the people .'
p10499
aS'but with mann ki baat whatever i was taught , whatever i was explained and the experiences i had , made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking .'
p10500
aS'our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual .'
p10501
aS'my experience of mann ki baat mademe realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as i have myself experienced them .'
p10502
aS'i asked for suggestions for mann ki baat and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them .'
p10503
aS'but people continued to contribute actively in lakhs .'
p10504
aS'this in itself is a great power .'
p10505
aS'i did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that i wrote a letter to the pm or posted on mygov .'
p10506
aS'in , yet my suggestions were not accepted even once .'
p10507
aS'yes .'
p10508
aS'these lakhs of letters did teach me something more .'
p10509
aS'i became aware of very minute problems associated with governance .'
p10510
aS'i would like to congratulate akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people .'
p10511
aS'they conducted programmes after that .'
p10512
aS'they called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised .'
p10513
aS'they tried to get certain problems resolved .'
p10514
aS'the various departments of thegovernment analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters , others to personal issues , some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of .'
p10515
aS'many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government .'
p10516
aS'it is true , the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom .'
p10517
aS'who would have thought that the mann ki baat will become a source ofinformation ?'
p10518
aS'but this has happened .'
p10519
aS'in the same way mann ki baat became a platform to express the power of society .'
p10520
aS'i had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became .'
p10521
aS'the whole world was amazed .'
p10522
aS'lakhs of people , perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters .'
p10523
aS'what dignity did it lend to our daughters ?'
p10524
aS'anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughters confidence but also made a commitment to them .'
p10525
aS'whosoever saw it realized that theywill now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters .'
p10526
aS'this was a kind of a silent revolution .'
p10527
aS'i had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens , keeping in mind the tourism industry of india to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of incredible india so that i can also see them .'
p10528
aS'people sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of india .'
p10529
aS'neither the government of india nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage .'
p10530
aS'all things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny .'
p10531
aS'the peoplethemselves took the task forward .'
p10532
aS'in october last year , i did my first mann ki baat .'
p10533
aS'in that edition i had mentioned about gandhi jayanti .'
p10534
aS'i told people that we are celebrating gandhijis birth anniversary on 2nd october .'
p10535
aS'there was a time when there was khadi for nation ?'
p10536
aS'isnt it the need of the hour that there be khadi for fashion ?'
p10537
aS'i requested the people to buy khadi and to do their bit .'
p10538
aS'today , i can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of khadi have almost doubled .'
p10539
aS'now see , there wasno government advertisement .'
p10540
aS'nor were lakhs and crores spent .'
p10541
aS'a simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change .'
p10542
aS'once i had mentioned in mann ki baat about the problem of poor families , how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit .'
p10543
aS'shouldnt they be getting gas cylinders ?'
p10544
aS'and i had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy .'
p10545
aS'just thinktoday i can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people .'
p10546
aS'i saw on t .'
p10547
aS'v , a retired teacher , a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy .'
p10548
aS'thecommon people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy .'
p10549
aS'but then they did give up their subsidy .'
p10550
aS'isnt it a silent revolution ?'
p10551
aS'isnt it a demonstration of the peoples power ?'
p10552
aS'the governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities , energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration .'
p10553
aS'there is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society .'
p10554
aS'mann ki baat has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again i would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform .'
p10555
aS'they took up everysmall cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country .'
p10556
aS'can there be a bigger satisfaction than this ?'
p10557
aS'this time i thought of conducting a new experiment through mann ki baat .'
p10558
aS'i had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded .'
p10559
aS'i told them that i will take it up in mann ki baat .'
p10560
aS'i am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country be it siachen , kutch or kamrup , be it kashmir or kanyakumari .'
p10561
aS'there is no part of india from which i did not receive a phone call .'
p10562
aS'this is a pleasant experience in itself .'
p10563
aS'people of all age groups have sent messages .'
p10564
aS'i listened to some message personally and i liked them .'
p10565
aS'my team is working on the others .'
p10566
aS'you must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important .'
p10567
aS'the entire government will work on your suggestions .'
p10568
aS'but there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy .'
p10569
aS'it feels as if there is negativity all around us .'
p10570
aS'but my experience was different .'
p10571
aS'these 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way .'
p10572
aS'it was frank interaction where they could say anything but i am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of mann ki baat .'
p10573
aS'they were totally positive , suggestion oriented and constructive .'
p10574
aS'just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude ; this is the nations greatest wealth .'
p10575
aS'there were serious complaints in about 1-2 % phone calls .'
p10576
aS'but more than 90 % things were energizing and pleasant .'
p10577
aS'another thing came to my mind , for the speciallyabled .'
p10578
aS'and among them especially from the kin of visually impaired , they made quite a number of phone calls .'
p10579
aS'the reason may be that they are not able to watch t .'
p10580
aS'v , but they must definitely be listening to the radio .'
p10581
aS'this made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people .'
p10582
aS'i am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive .'
p10583
aS'pawan acharya form alwar , rajasthan has sent me a message .'
p10584
aS'i believe that all of you should hear it and follow it .'
p10585
aS'please hear what he wants to say-my name is pawan acharya and i belong to alwar , rajasthan .'
p10586
aS'i want to give the message to prime minister , shri narendra modi ji to request all the people of india through his programme mann ki baat to use as much earthen lamps ( diya ) as they can this diwali .'
p10587
aS'this will not only help the environment , but will also provide employment to many potter families .'
p10588
aS'thank you .'
p10589
aS'pawan , i believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of india .'
p10590
aS'it is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless .'
p10591
aS'so the earthen lamps will be valuable too .'
p10592
aS'it is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor mans home .'
p10593
aS'poor people earn their living this way .'
p10594
aS'i request the citizens to follow pawans advice in the coming festivals .'
p10595
aS'if we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor .'
p10596
aS'my dear countrymen , on the day of ganesh chaturthi , i had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces .'
p10597
aS'the jawans from our army , navy and air force guarding our land , waters and skies .'
p10598
aS'we have completed 50 years of our war with pakistan in 1965 .'
p10599
aS'to commemorate this event an exhibition named shouryanjali had been organized near india gate .'
p10600
aS'i saw it with immense interest .'
p10601
aS'i went there for half an hour but when i came out it was more than 2.'
p10602
aS'5 hours andi felt like seeing more .'
p10603
aS'what was it that was not there ?'
p10604
aS'the entire history has been brought to life .'
p10605
aS'from aesthetic perspective it was excellent , from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this .'
p10606
aS'at that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war , those tales of valour and sacrifice of our greatsoldiers , which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition .'
p10607
aS'whether it is the battle of haji pir , chaminda or asal uttar and the visuals of our victory near haji pir , we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers .'
p10608
aS'i had the opportunity to meet the brave families , families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives .'
p10609
aS'they too had come and when i was shaking hands , it was filled with great energy was very inspiring .'
p10610
aS'if you want to create history , then itis necessary to understand the nuances of the past .'
p10611
aS'history binds us to our roots .'
p10612
aS'if we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end .'
p10613
aS'this exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past .'
p10614
aS'it gives us knowledge about our history .'
p10615
aS'and this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history .'
p10616
aS'this exhibition will last a few days .'
p10617
aS'i request you and your relatives living in delhi and nearby areas todefinitely visit it .'
p10618
aS'and do not be in haste like me .'
p10619
aS'i came back in 2-2.'
p10620
aS'5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours , do see it .'
p10621
aS'look at the power of democracy , a young kid has ordered the prime minister , although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry .'
p10622
aS'i do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought , not only should the prime minister think about what he said but every indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say : prime minister , modi ji , i want to tell you that , for the swachhta abhiyan ( cleaniness drive ) that you started , you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner .'
p10623
aS'this child is absolutely right .'
p10624
aS'we should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness .'
p10625
aS'i got great satisfaction from this childs message .'
p10626
aS'on the 2nd of october , i declared this cleanliness drive and i think something like this has happened for the first time after independence because even in the parliament , cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days .'
p10627
aS'our government is criticized as well .'
p10628
aS'i even have to listen to a lot of things ; people saythings like modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness , but what really happened ?'
p10629
aS'i dont get offended by all this .'
p10630
aS'i look at the positive side of it , which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in india .'
p10631
aS'look at the other side , on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country , both are talking about cleanliness , a country can not be more fortunate than this .'
p10632
aS'this ongoing movement of thoughts , the environment thats building against filth , there has been an awareness towards cleanliness .'
p10633
aS'this will also compel the governments to work .'
p10634
aS'the self-governing regional bodies , be it panchayats , municipal corporations , municipalities , municipal corporations ofmetropolitan cities , central government or state government everybody will have to work on this .'
p10635
aS'we will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in india in 2019 , when we celebrate the 150th birthday of mahatma gandhi , we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream .'
p10636
aS'do you know what mahatma gandhi used to say ?'
p10637
aS'he once said , if i have to choose between freedom and cleanliness , i will choose cleanliness first and freedom later .'
p10638
aS'cleanliness was more important for gandhi than freedom .'
p10639
aS'come let us all follow what mahatma gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish .'
p10640
aS'mr gulshan arora from delhi has left a message on mygov .'
p10641
aS'he has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of dindayal ji .'
p10642
aS'my dear fellow citizens , the lives of great men will always inspire us .'
p10643
aS'it is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men .'
p10644
aS'everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us .'
p10645
aS'in the coming days , we will get to remember a lot of these great men .'
p10646
aS'25th september we shall remember pandit deendayal upadhaya , mahatma gandhi and lal bahadur shastri on the 2nd of october , jai prakash narayan ji on 11th october , sardar vallabh bhai patel on 31st octoberand there are innumerable names , i have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems .'
p10647
aS'you pick any date ; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history .'
p10648
aS'we must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days , take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves .'
p10649
aS'i would like to request you for 2nd october specially .'
p10650
aS'its the birth anniversary of honorable bapu mahatma gandhi .'
p10651
aS'i had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing , all kinds of fabric , a lot of things , but you must also own khadi .'
p10652
aS'i am saying it again , that khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd october onwards for one whole month .'
p10653
aS'you must all avail this sale .'
p10654
aS'along with khadi , handloom must also be given equal importance .'
p10655
aS'our weavers put in a lot of hard work .'
p10656
aS'if we , 1.'
p10657
aS'5 billion indians buy a handloom product or khadi for even rs .'
p10658
aS'5 , 10 or rs .'
p10659
aS'50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver .'
p10660
aS'it will reach the poor widow who weaves khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for khadi at our homes and on our bodies this diwali .'
p10661
aS'i just have this small request , i do not insist that you only wear khadi .'
p10662
aS'but have a few collection .'
p10663
aS'this is my only request .'
p10664
aS'look , last year we almost doubled thekhadi sale .'
p10665
aS'a lot of the poor have been benefitted .'
p10666
aS'advertisements worth crores , by the government , can not achieve what has been achieved through your help .'
p10667
aS'this is the power of the masses and this is why i request you to come forward and help once again .'
p10668
aS'dear countrymen , my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing .'
p10669
aS'i wish to share this joy with you as well .'
p10670
aS'i visited kolkata in the month of may and the family members of subhash chandra bose came to meet me .'
p10671
aS'his nephew chandra bose had organized everything .'
p10672
aS'i got the opportunity to spend quality time with subhash babus family members .'
p10673
aS'that day i decided to invite his great family to the prime ministers residence .'
p10674
aS'mr chandra bose and his family members were in theprocess of organising this and last week i received the confirmation that around 50 members of the bose family are coming to the prime ministers residence for a meeting .'
p10675
aS'you can imagine how happy i must have been on hearing this news .'
p10676
aS'netajis family members , probably , must have been invited together to the prime ministers residence for the first time .'
p10677
aS'more than that , i feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that i will get in october must be a one of a kind opportunity for the prime ministers residence to offer its hospitality .'
p10678
aS'more than 50 family members of subhash babus family who stay in different countries are specially coming downto attend this meeting .'
p10679
aS'it is going to be a joyous moment for me .'
p10680
aS'i am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy .'
p10681
aS'i received a message from bhargavi kande and after listening to the way she speaks , her voice , i felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably .'
p10682
aS'my name is bhargavi kande .'
p10683
aS'i want to request the prime minister to make the young generation aware about voters registration , which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government .'
p10684
aS'thank youbhargavi talked about registering the names in the voters list and the voting process .'
p10685
aS'in a democracy , every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually .'
p10686
aS'the voting percentage is also increasing and for this i want to congratulate the election commission of india .'
p10687
aS'up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years .'
p10688
aS'today , our election commission does not workonly as a regulator but has become a facilitator , has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies .'
p10689
aS'it is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do .'
p10690
aS'we must mobilize schools , colleges and societies we must spread awareness always , not only during the time of elections .'
p10691
aS'the voters list must be updated ; we must also keep a watch on it .'
p10692
aS'this priceless right that i have , is it safe ?'
p10693
aS'am i using it or not ?'
p10694
aS'we must alldevelop this habit .'
p10695
aS'i hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voters list yet , get themselves registered and must vote too .'
p10696
aS'i publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food .'
p10697
aS'this is a holy act , everyone must do it .'
p10698
aS'i have returned from a visit to kashi , day before yesterday .'
p10699
aS'i met a lot of people and attended a lot of events .'
p10700
aS'i met many people there but these two kids i met have told me something that i want to share with you today .'
p10701
aS'one of the boys , kshitij , is a student of class 7 .'
p10702
aS'he studies in the kendriya vidyalaya of banaras hindu university .'
p10703
aS'he is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level .'
p10704
aS'at such a young age i saw that he was interested in research in the fieldof physics .'
p10705
aS'i thought he must be reading a lot books , must be surfing internet , must be watching new experiments .'
p10706
aS'he was talking about things like , how to stop railway accidents , which technology to use , how to save money in producing energy , how to develop feelings in robots and what not .'
p10707
aS'he was an amazing kid .'
p10708
aS'although i could not follow what he was saying , very closely , but i liked his confidence and his interest in so many things .'
p10709
aS'i want that kids in our country should developmore and more interest in science .'
p10710
aS'kids should be very inquisitive , why ?'
p10711
aS'how ?'
p10712
aS'when ?'
p10713
aS'a kid should always ask these questions .'
p10714
aS'similarly , i met a small girl named , sonam patel .'
p10715
aS'she is 9 years old .'
p10716
aS'she is the daughter of sadavrat patel , a resident of sundarpur , varanasi .'
p10717
aS'her family is very poor .'
p10718
aS'i was surprised that the girl had memorized the bhagvada geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its english interpretation and its definition in english as well as hindi .'
p10719
aS'when i asked , her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was onlyfive years old .'
p10720
aS'i asked where she learned it from .'
p10721
aS'they said , we do not have any idea .'
p10722
aS'then i asked if she only reads geetha or does she read something else as well ?'
p10723
aS'her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once , she has everything memorized by the evening .'
p10724
aS'if she picks history , she knows everything by the evening .'
p10725
aS'he told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has .'
p10726
aS'i was really very impressed .'
p10727
aS'sometimes , kids become obsessedwith celebrities ; sonam did not have any such obsessions .'
p10728
aS'i felt this girl is god-gifted .'
p10729
aS'meeting these kids was a very special experience that i had on my kashi visit .'
p10730
aS'so , i thought i must share it with you .'
p10731
aS'we do a lot of things , other than what you see on the tv and read in the newspapers .'
p10732
aS'sometimes , we enjoy doing these things as well .'
p10733
aS'similarly , i will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids .'
p10734
aS'i noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in mann ki baat .'
p10735
aS'look what sandeep from haryana has to say , sir , i want you to do mann ki baat a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words .'
p10736
aS'sandeep ji , what all will you make me do ?'
p10737
aS'i have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme , have to make adjustments to my time-table .'
p10738
aS'sometimes , our friends at akashwani have to wait for an hour or so .'
p10739
aS'i still respect your feelings .'
p10740
aS'i am thankful to you for your suggestion .'
p10741
aS'for now , we will stick to the one month program only .'
p10742
aS'mann ki baat in a way has completed a year .'
p10743
aS'do you know , how much did subhash babu use the radio ?'
p10744
aS'he started his own show from germany and he would constantly update the indian citizens about the independence movement through radio .'
p10745
aS'he started the azad hind radio through a weekly news bulletin .'
p10746
aS'english , hindi , bengali , marathi punjabi , pashto , urdu , he used to run the radio in all these languages .'
p10747
aS'i have also completed a year since i started mann ki baat .'
p10748
aS'my mann ki baat has in the true sense become your mann ki baat .'
p10749
aS'i listen to you , i think for you , i look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through akashvani .'
p10750
aS'i speak , but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction .'
p10751
aS'we shall meet next month again for mann ki baat .'
p10752
aS'your suggestions should keep coming in .'
p10753
aS'the government gets benefited by your suggestions .'
p10754
aS'ithelps to initiate improvement .'
p10755
aS'your contribution is priceless for me .'
p10756
aS'once again , many congratulations to all of you .'
p10757
aS'thank you !'
p10758
aa(lp10759
S'your excellency president dilma rousseff , your excellency chancellor angela merkel , your excellency prime minister shinzo abe , distinguished delegation members , i am delighted to welcome you all .'
p10760
aS'thank you for attending this meeting early on a saturday morning .'
p10761
aS'i want to especially thank prime minister abe , who has just arrived in new york .'
p10762
aS'the subject of reforms in the united nations security council has been the focus of global attention for decades unfortunately , without progress so far .'
p10763
aS'our group of four countries , g-4 , came together in 2004 , bound by our shared commitment to global peace and prosperity , our faith in multilateralism and our willingness to assume our global responsibilities that the world expects from us .'
p10764
aS'i am delighted that we are meeting again as heads of government after ten years .'
p10765
aS'as i had reflected in my letter on the 70th anniversary of the united nations , we live in a fundamentally different world from the time the un was born .'
p10766
aS'the number of member states has grown four-fold .'
p10767
aS'threats to peace and security have become more complex , unpredictable and undefined .'
p10768
aS'in many ways , our lives are becoming globalized , but fault-lines around our identities are growing .'
p10769
aS'we live in a digital age .'
p10770
aS'the global economy is changed , with new engines of growth , more widely dispersed economic power and widening wealth gap .'
p10771
aS'trends in demography , urbanization and migrations are posing new challenges .'
p10772
aS'climate change and terrorism are new concerns .'
p10773
aS'cyber and space are entirely new frontiers of opportunities and challenges .'
p10774
aS'yet , our institutions , approaches , and often mindsets , reflect the wisdom of the century we have left behind , not the century we live in .'
p10775
aS'this is especially true of the united nations security council .'
p10776
aS'the reform of the security council within a fixed time frame has become an urgent and important task .'
p10777
aS'the security council must include the worlds largest democracies , major locomotives of the global economy , and voices from all the major continents .'
p10778
aS'it will carry greater credibility and legitimacy and will be more representative and effective in addressing the challenges of the 21st century .'
p10779
aS'after decades , we finally see some movement .'
p10780
aS'the 69th session of the general assembly has taken a significant step forward to commence text-based negotiations .'
p10781
aS'this would not have been possible but for the dynamic leadership of h .'
p10782
aS'e .'
p10783
aS'mr sam kutesa and ambassador courtney rattray .'
p10784
aS'however , this is just the first step .'
p10785
aS'we should aim to take this process to its logical conclusion during the 70th session .'
p10786
aS'i am confident that our meeting today will give a big impetus to our efforts in this direction .'
p10787
aa(lp10788
S'thank you , every one !'
p10789
aS'lets give a big hand to our outstanding young exhibitors today .'
p10790
aS'thank you for coming out in strength on a sunday .'
p10791
aS'reid hoffman , your linkedin is a great product .'
p10792
aS'and , you are an inspiration to many here and in india .'
p10793
aS'thank you , mohan , venkie , ambassador .'
p10794
aS'it is a great pleasure to be here .'
p10795
aS'for me , this is a special event , because the idea of startups is close to my heart .'
p10796
aS'you are likely to wonder why , because governments and national capitals are supposed to stop or slow things down , not start them up .'
p10797
aS'i know this was once the view of washington from silicon valley ; and , this is exactly how tech specialists in bengaluru thought about new delhi .'
p10798
aS'and , i know that many of you think that the only problems that have not been solved are the ones for which you have not written the apps yet .'
p10799
aS'when i shifted to delhi last year , i thought of my government as a startup .'
p10800
aS'so , i also saw some of the bumps you face on the road .'
p10801
aS'i understand your challenges , but also the wonderful feeling of creating something new .'
p10802
aS'the course of human history and progress has been shaped by imagination , inspiration , invention and innovation .'
p10803
aS'i often say , if theres a strong wind blowing , some might want to shut the window .'
p10804
aS'others will want to put up a windmill or launch their sails on the seas .'
p10805
aS'the difference between perception of something as a challenge or an opportunity is the difference between inertia and initiative ; status quo and progress .'
p10806
aS'the idea of start ups is as ancient as this world .'
p10807
aS'each economic age has been defined by disruption of the previous one , by the evolution of ideas and products that displace the old ones .'
p10808
aS'start ups have always been the engine of progress .'
p10809
aS'the mega corporations of today were startsup of yesterday .'
p10810
aS'what is different now is that the digital age has created a fertile new environment for startups .'
p10811
aS'this is a world in which you dont grow by extracting resources , but by spreading an idea .'
p10812
aS'more than the creator , it is the consumer , who discovers applications .'
p10813
aS'today , the startups defy the natural rates of growth .'
p10814
aS'an idea can become a global name within a year .'
p10815
aS'customers can multiply at the rate of millions , employees at the rate of thousands and valuation at the rate of billions .'
p10816
aS'the convergence of technology , integration across diverse fields , distributed architecture and people willing to back an idea , have opened a new world for enterprise .'
p10817
aS'this ecosystem was born in the silicon valley .'
p10818
aS'no community is shaping our world as much as the one on this californian coast .'
p10819
aS'it isnt just big names , but small firms that are fashioning every day new ways to enrich human life with the joy of artists and creators .'
p10820
aS'that underlines americas success and inspires the world .'
p10821
aS'so , i see startups , technology and innovation as exciting and effective instruments for indias transformation , and for creating jobs for our youth .'
p10822
aS'we are a nation of 800 million youth below the age of 35 years .'
p10823
aS'they are eager for change ; have the energy and drive to pursue it ; and , the confidence to achieve it .'
p10824
aS'when each of the five hundred odd towns produces ten startups and each of our six hundred thousand villages produce six small businesses , on a regular basis , we will create an enormous economic momentum and generate a huge number of jobs in our country .'
p10825
aS'indias own ecosystem of startups is evolving rapidly .'
p10826
aS'it is driven by the energy , enterprise and innovation of our youth .'
p10827
aS'we have a huge market with rapid growth and untapped opportunities in every sector .'
p10828
aS'we now have the institutions , incentives and interest for new ventures .'
p10829
aS'we have incubators , accelerators and investors willing to back an idea and assume risks .'
p10830
aS'india has woken up to the potential of startup ventures with great enthusiasm and energy .'
p10831
aS'in the past few years , they have grown exponentially .'
p10832
aS'we have here an outstanding group of startups from india .'
p10833
aS'they are applying technology to transform healthcare , education , agriculture , clean energy , security , financial inclusion of the poor and access to clean water .'
p10834
aS'our startups represent not just commercial success stories , but are powerful examples of social innovation .'
p10835
aS'the pace at which people in india are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age , education , language and income .'
p10836
aS'there are nearly a billion people with cell phones in india ; smart phones and internet users are in hundred millions , growing at high double digits .'
p10837
aS'the scale of indias development needs is huge .'
p10838
aS'and , the need to achieve it is urgent .'
p10839
aS'we can not simply continue on the traditional paths to development .'
p10840
aS'this is the vision and the spirit behind digital india , which i spoke about last night : to use technology to transform governance , empower our citizens , eliminate barriers to opportunities , deepen social change , impart scale and speed to development , improve delivery of services , design affordable products for the poor , customize services for specific groups , and build a more sustainable future for our planet .'
p10841
aS'startups will have an important role in achieving our vision .'
p10842
aS'from creating infrastructure to providing services , from manufacture of products to human resource development , from supporting governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy , digital india is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you .'
p10843
aS'i see startups , not as short term investments , but as long term commitments .'
p10844
aS'our application and enterprise is limited only by our imagination .'
p10845
aS'we have here today our department of space that provides free data on its portal .'
p10846
aS'in the course of past few months , we have put together 170 applications of space technology in governance and development .'
p10847
aS'many of these could become the vehicles of new ventures in india .'
p10848
aS'but , it is not just about the opportunities generated on the digital platform and advanced science by urban enterprises .'
p10849
aS'i want to see the idea and the spirit of startups light up the economies and the fortunes of people in rural india .'
p10850
aS'from handicrafts to tourism , the frontiers of possibilities and the scale of reach in india is immense .'
p10851
aS'i want this especially for our rural women , who have shown marvelous success in enterprise , whenever they have had opportunity .'
p10852

S'president barack obama , secretary general ban ki-moon , excellencies , the foundations of the united nations were laid by the brave soldiers on the battlefields of second world war .'
p10946
aS'by 1945 , they included 2.'
p10947
aS'5 million men of the indian army , the largest volunteer force in history .'
p10948
aS'more than 24000 lost their lives and nearly half of that went missing .'
p10949
aS'the legacy of that sacrifice is shared by three countries present here .'
p10950
aS'they remain today among the largest contributors to the united nations peacekeeping operations .'
p10951
aS'over 180,000 indian troops have participated in un peacekeeping missions - more than from any other country .'
p10952
aS'india has participated in 48 of the 69 un peacekeeping missions so far .'
p10953
aS'161 indian peacekeepers have made the supreme sacrifice while serving in un missions .'
p10954
aS'india was the first country to contribute a female formed police unit to un mission in liberia .'
p10955
aS'india has been providing training to peacekeeping officers from a large number of countries .'
p10956
aS'till date , we have trained nearly 800 officers from 82 countries .'
p10957
aS'i thank president obama for hosting this summit on peacekeeping .'
p10958
aS'it is timely not just because of the 70th anniversary of the organization .'
p10959
aS'it is also because the security environment is changing , the demands on peacekeeping are growing and the resources are harder to find .'
p10960
aS'todays peacekeepers are called upon not only to maintain peace and security , but also address a range of complex challenges .'
p10961
aS'mandates are ambitious ; but , resources are often inadequate .'
p10962
aS'mandates sometimes make peacekeepers party to conflicts , putting at risk their lives and success of their missions .'
p10963
aS'the problems arise to a large extent because troop contributing countries do not have a role in the decision-making process .'
p10964
aS'they do not have adequate representation in senior management and as force commanders .'
p10965
aS'peacekeeping missions should be deployed prudently , with full recognition of their limitations and in support of political solutions .'
p10966
aS'we are pleased that the high-level independent panel on peace operations has recognized these issues .'
p10967
aS'we thank un secretary general for his prompt report on the panels recommendations .'
p10968
aS'we look forward to their early consideration .'
p10969
aS'indias commitment to un peacekeeping remains strong and will grow .'
p10970
aS'we have announced new intended contributions that to the un peacekeeping operations .'
p10971
aS'these include additional battalion of up to 850 troops in existing or new operations ; additional 03 police units with higher representation of female peacekeepers ; commitment to provide critical enablers ; deployment of technical personnel in un missions ; and , additional training for peacekeepers at our facilities in india and in the field .'
p10972
aS'in conclusion , l wish to emphasise that the success of un peacekeeping ultimately depends not on the weapons that the soldiers carry , but on the moral force that decisions of the un security council command .'
p10973
aS'we must complete the long-pending task of reforms within a fixed time frame of the un security council to preserve the relevance and effectiveness of the un .'
p10974
aS'i would like to pay homage to the peacekeepers who have laid down their lives in defending the highest ideals of the united nations .'
p10975
aS'it would be most fitting if the proposed memorial wall to the fallen peacekeepers is created quickly .'
p10976
aS'india stands ready to contribute , including financially , to this objective .'

aS'we have agreed on india germany climate and renewable energy alliance with a long term vision and a comprehensive agenda of combating climate change .'
p11008
aS'i place great value on germanys assistance of over one billion euros for indias green energy corridor and a new assistance package of over a billion euros forsolar projects in india .'
p11009
aS'we also intend to deepen research cooperation in clean and renewable energy , and energy efficiency .'
p11010
aS'to contain temperature rise we must also change our temperament .'
p11011
aS'we look forward to a concrete outcome at cop21 in paris that strengthens the commitment and the ability of the world , especially of poor and vulnerable countries , to transition to a more sustainable growth path .'
p11012
aS'our partnership will also grow in areas like defence manufacturing , trade in advanced technology , intelligence , and countering terrorismand radicalism .'
p11013
aS'these are important security dimensions of our expanding relationship .'
p11014
aS'i welcome germanys strong support for indias membership of the international export control regimes .'
p11015
aS'as we discussed in the g4 summit in new york , chancellor and i are committed to pursue reforms of the united nations , especially the security council .'
p11016
aS'we have a common perspective on this region ; the turbulence in west asia ; europes challenges ; and , shaping a peaceful and stable asia pacific and indian ocean region .'

p11018

p11019
aS'she is a symbol of the victory of good over evil .'
p11020
aS'this also suggests that in this age of transitions and turmoil , india-germany partnership will be a force of good for the world .'
p11021
aS'it is a saying common to both our cultures that friendship is a plant that needs to be watered .'
p11022

aS'welcome to this indo german summit .'
p11029
aS'i fondly recall my visit to the city of hannover and hannover messe in april.'
p11030
aS'15 states , a number of ceos and hundreds of companies from india , had participated .'
p11031
aS'the exposure to hannover messe will go a long way in shaping our vision and strategy of manufacturing .'
p11032
aS'this is particularly important at a time when we are on the path of making india a global manufacturing hub .'

p11034
aS'merkel and friends !'
p11035
aS'there is tremendous potential in india-germany economic collaboration .'
p11036
aS'germany ranks 7th among foreign investor countries in india .'
p11037
aS'about 600 indo-german joint ventures are already operating in india .'
p11038
aS'however , as of now , our economic partnership remains below our full potential .'
p11039
aS'we are particularly keen to develop the sectors where germany is strong .'
p11040
aS'we are working hard to create conducive conditions for the same .'
p11041
aS'friends !'
p11042
aS'at a time of global slowdown , india represents a bright spot for investments .'
p11043
aS'we are fortunate to be sailing in the right direction .'
p11044
aS'the recent data on global economic activity reinforces this assertion .'
p11045
aS'however , we can not afford to be complacent .'
p11046
aS'we are committed to doing everything possible to convert these analyses into reality .'
p11047
aS'with a very open and global mindset , we have worked aggressively in the last fifteen months to make india an easy place to do business .'
p11048
aS'we are committed to creating favorable conditions for business and industry because we believe that they are necessary for improving the lives of ordinary citizens in india .'
p11049
aS'a recent study conducted with the help of the world bank group has brought out the urgency among our provincial governments on ease of doing business .'
p11050
aS'they are movinghand-in-hand with the federal government in this direction in a true spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism .'
p11051
aS'in fact the provincial governments have now entered into a healthy competition among themselves to ensure that a transparent , predictable and user friendly regulatory mechanism is quickly put in place .'
p11052
aS'friends !'
p11053
aS'one of the biggest challenges in india today is to productively employ our youth .'
p11054
aS'for meeting this challenge , we need to provide a huge push to manufacturing which has stagnated at around 16 % of the gdp for several decades in india .'
p11055
aS'this percentage must reach around 25 in the short and medium term .'
p11056
aS'with this in view , we have launched the make in india initiative .'
p11057
aS'to make it a success , apart from vigorous implementation of measures for ease of doing business , we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure .'
p11058
aS'transparent auction and allocation of spectrum and of key natural resources like coal , iron ore and other minerals in the last 15 months have created a level playing field for investors .'
p11059
aS'we are aware that our domestic financial resources are not sufficient to meet our needs .'
p11060
aS'therefore , to enhance the flow of foreign investments , we have liberalized the fdi regime allowing 100 % fdi in railways and enhancing the fdi limit to 49 % in defence and insurance .'
p11061
aS'we have also refined our fdi policy for construction and medical devices .'
p11062
aS'we have rationalized a number of other fdi related policy issues including bringing in the concept of composite sector caps for thefpis and other investors .'
p11063
aS'we are keen to build futuristic physical and social infrastructure .'
p11064
aS'through self-imposed discipline in the management of our financial resources , we have been able to allocate more resources for infrastructure sectors .'
p11065
aS'in addition , we are setting up an india investment and infrastructure fund .'
p11066
aS'we have targeted an annual flow of rs 20,000 crore ( which is approximately 2.'
p11067
aS'7 billion euros ) into this fund from our own resources .'
p11068
aS'we are putting in place a professional team for assetmanagement .'
p11069
aS'we have also come up with the mechanism of tax free infrastructure bonds for projects in rail , road and irrigation sectors .'
p11070
aS'there were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on the sentiments of foreign investors .'
p11071
aS'we have taken very decisive steps to remove a number of long pending concerns of investors .'
p11072
aS'to give you some examples : - we have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance ; - across the board , we have increased the validity period of industrial licences ; - we have de-licenced a number of defence items and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate- we have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years ; - we have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and reinforced this position by not going for imposition of minimum alternate tax on fpis ; - we have notified the regulations for the alternative investment funds allowing foreign investments in such funds ; - we have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for real estate investment trusts - we have modified the permanent establishment norms ; - we have also decided to defer the implementation of the general anti-avoidance rules for two years ; - we have introduced the gst bill in parliament ; we are hopeful to roll it out in 2016 ; - we are working on a new bankruptcy code ; the company law tribunal is soon going to be formed .'
p11073
aS'we want to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable .'
p11074
aS'we are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters .'
p11075
aS'as a result of our initiatives , the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive .'
p11076
aS'the growth rate of our gdp is above 7 % .'
p11077
aS'fdi inflows have gone up by 40 % compared with previous years corresponding period .'
p11078
aS'many international financial institutions including the world bank , imf , oecd and others are predicting even faster growth in the coming years .'
p11079
aS'moodys have upgraded the rating of india as positive .'
p11080
aS'india has improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness .'
p11081
aS'against 15th so far , now we are at 9th place .'
p11082
aS'india has also jumped 16 places on the world economic forums global competitive index after five years of decline in the list .'
p11083
aS'similarly , in a ranking of the top global destinations for greenfield investment in the first half of 2015 , india is at number one .'
p11084
aS'foreign policy magazine of usa has ranked india as number one fdi destination .'
p11085
aS'thus , just in fifteen months , we have successfully restored the credibility of india in the eyes of global players .'
p11086
aS'i have always said that government has no business to do business .'
p11087
aS'hence , through ppp or otherwise , we are encouraging private investments in areas where earlier only government used to invest .'
p11088
aS'we are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises , to instill market discipline .'
p11089
aS'friends .'
p11090
aS'i want to assure you that india is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of all innovators and entrepreneurs .'

p11095
aS'friends !'
p11096
aS'we want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality .'
p11097
aS'our commitment and aggressiveness to achieve the goal in a faster and effective manner offers immense opportunities to german companies .'
p11098
aS'these opportunities range from building 50 million houses to setting up 100 smart cities ; modernization of our railway network and stations to setting up of new railway corridors ; generation of 175 gw of renewable energy to construction of transmission anddistribution networks , national highways , bridges , and metro rails .'
p11099
aS'such a huge potential for creation and production will not be available in any one country .'
p11100
aS'more importantly , no one place on the earth can offer the potential for consumption on such a massive scale .'
p11101
aS'we are trying to power this potential through our campaigns like digital india and skill india .'
p11102
aS'to tap the energy fully , we have launched the start up india campaign .'
p11103
aS'i thank nasscom for becoming our active partner in this journey .'
p11104
aS'recently , we tried to ignite this energy through an interface of our youth with the eco-system of silicon valley .'
p11105
aS'india , in fact , is on the threshold of a big it revolution .'
p11106
aS'we are at the tipping point where technology is going to be leveraged to meet the aspirations of our 1.'

aS'some of these have begun to challenge established global players .'
p11116
aS'to conclude , i can assure you that we will be open to welcome your ideas , innovations and enterprises .'
p11117
aS'i had said in hannover and i am saying it again , that we are also open to carry out necessary corrections in our policies and procedures .'
p11118
aS'i can say that , never before , india was so well prepared to absorb talent , technology and investment from outside .'
p11119
aS'to our understanding , the necessary conditions to propel the indian economy to a high growth trajectory do exist today .'
p11120
aS'i am eagerly looking forward to working with you .'
p11121
aS'while in bengaluru , i must add that it is the software of india that will move the hardware across the world ; it is the talent of india that will master the technology ; it is the market of india that will motivate manufacturing .'
p11122
aS'therefore , it makes strong business sense to be in india .'
p11123
aS'it makes even better business sense to make in india .'
p11124
aS'thank you very much !'
p11125
aa(lp11126
S'a very warm welcome to all of you .'
p11127
aS'some of you have probably had the opportunity of visiting india before and for some probably it is the first time that you are visiting india .'
p11128
aS'i hope that for your comfort you have been well looked after here .'
p11129
aS'i know that there is an official programme but if you have any suggestion of what you would like to do here in addition to the programme that has been set up for you , that can be accommodated .'
p11130
aS'i also want that your visit here is not only important in the context of the india-africa forum summit but the very fact that it is a visit to india , it is important and there will be full efforts on the part of my government .'
p11131
aS'i feel that this india-africa forum summit is very important from many points of view .'
p11132
aS'of course for india it is very important given that we are the host country , but this is the first summit where all the 54 countries of africa have been invited and all the 54 countries are participating .'
p11133
aS'in that sense the india-africa forum summit is the biggest event of its sort and partnership at this scale .'
p11134
aS'till now as per the information that we have received , 40 countries will be represented at the head of state , head of government level , the rest are being represented by senior ministers .'
p11135
aS'this time , in association with the india-africa forum summit there is also the conference of trade ministers because we would want that in the days and months and years to come the economic relations between india and africa should be further strengthened .'
p11136
aS'the india-africa forum summits have had two summits earlier , in 2008 and 2011 , and now this is the 3rd india-africa forum summit taking place .'
p11137
aS'earlier the two summits were organised on the basis of the banjul formula , and in that sense very limited countries had come and participated .'
p11138
aS'but this time we decided to in fact come out of this formula and ensure that there was participation from all countries of africa .'
p11139
aS'this i think is going to take relations between india and africa to new heights .'
p11140
aS'i think it is this partnership and this equality that is being given to all the countries .'
p11141
aS'this is an initiative on our part and i think this is what makes this summit different from the two earlier versions .'
p11142
aS'there are going to be meetings at various levels , at the top level .'
p11143
aS'i think it is this partnership with all which is going to bring a new freshness in every corner of africa .'
p11144
aS'this new freshness is not just for africa but also for india that this summit is going to bring new freshness in our relations .'
p11145
aS'i have been told that of course you have come to india and you are going to have a week-long programme during which you will be taken to various parts of the country and you will be seeing for yourself the progress and development .'
p11146
aS'but in addition to you there are 400 journalists who are coming to cover this event from africa and they are coming on their own with their own means .'
p11147
aS'i think this itself indicates the importance that is being attached to this summit .'
p11148
aS'from the discussions that i have been having with everyone , this summit in fact is attracting the focus of the entire world and people are in fact looking at it with great importance and i see this as a very good sign .'
p11149
aS'the relations between india and the countries of africa , these relations and these bonds that we have , are not just political and economic but we also have a very rich cultural tradition .'
p11150
aS'it is said that millions of years ago in fact the two parts of the earth were one piece and it was only much later that they became two separate pieces of land , one was asia and the other was africa ; and we have an ocean which divides us .'
p11151
aS'the west coast of india and the east coast of africa in fact are linked by the sea .'
p11152
aS'i hail from the west coast of india from the state of gujarat .'
p11153
aS'it was in fact the gujaratis who started trade and commerce with africa and maritime relations earlier on .'
p11154
aS'even today there are 270,000 indians who live in africa and many of them are gujaratis .'
p11155
aS'in fact i too have had my links with africa not only when i was the chief minister of gujarat but even before that .'
p11156
aS'i have always had relations with the african continent and whenever guests came they always met me .'
p11157
aS'i have always had very good relations with various personalities of africa .'
p11158
aS'so , from a personal point of view i have always had very close links with this region .'
p11159
aS'in fact there are many similarities between india and africa and together india and africa we represent one third of the worlds population .'
p11160
aS'the population of india equals in fact the population of the entire african continent .'
p11161
aS'africa in fact represents the youngest region in the world and india too is the youngest country .'
p11162
aS'perhaps when we look at the world today these are the only two places where 65 per cent of the population is below 35 years of age and i feel that this is a matter of great fortune for both africa and for india .'
p11163
aS'the bilateral trade between india and africa has been growing very rapidly and in the past few years it has grown by eight to nine times .'
p11164
aS'i feel that after this summit it is going to see another major jump .'
p11165
aS'india also is a major investor in africa today and this is especially so in the oil sector and this is giving a new dynamism to the african economy .'
p11166
aS'following the two previous india-africa forum summits , india has given to the tune of 7.'
p11167
aS'4 billion dollars of concessional credit and this has been used to enhance in the fields of infrastructure , agriculture , industry , energy and water .'
p11168
aS'in more than 40 countries today there are more than 100 projects which are under implementation .'
p11169
aS'in the same vein , india has invested 1.'
p11170
aS'2 billion dollars in more than 100 institutes and this is contributing in a major way to human resource development .'
p11171
aS'for me i think the point which makes me the most happy is that there is this partnership between india and africa that is human resource development , the capacity building .'
p11172
aS'and in the last few years we have had the good fortune of imparting education and training to around 25,000 african students and i think this is a matter of good fortune for india .'
p11173
aS'today in africa many of the leaders who are now in power and in top position have had their education and training in india .'
p11174
aS'i think between india and africa there is another aspect that links us with many countries in africa and that is solar power from which many african countries are benefiting .'
p11175
aS'i think this is going to become a very strong community of nations and in the times to come the problem of climate change that the world is trying to counter and fight , we are going to be playing a very major role in mitigation and lessening the effects of climate change .'
p11176
aS'i think both india and africa can feel proud of the fact that today the world is facing the problem of climate change , of the concerns regarding global warming , i think both india and africa have had a tradition and it is in their culture not to pollute or not to damage the environment , and we have perhaps sinned the less and contributed the minimum to this big problem to the world .'
p11177
aS'i think this also is a common factor between india and africa .'
p11178
aS'i am convinced that during this summit and following the summit we are going to have very important decisions which will give both india and africa a new sense of self confidence , our relations are going to become closer and deeper , and together i think we can lay the foundations of what we can contribute to the world .'
p11179
aS'once again a very warm welcome to you .'
p11180
aS'i will also have the opportunity of greeting you during the summit once again .'
p11181
aS'thank you .'
p11182
aa(lp11183
S'namaskar to all my fellow citizens !'
p11184
aS'once again i have the opportunity of connecting with you through mann ki baat .'
p11185
aS'today the fifth one day cricket match is being played between india and south africa in mumbai .'
p11186
aS'this series has been named as the gandhi-mandela series .'
p11187
aS'it is at an interesting point with both teams having won 2 matches each .'
p11188
aS'so the last game is significantly important .'
p11189
aS'my best wishes to all the players .'
p11190
aS'today i would like to congratulate the friends at the kannur centre of akashwani .'
p11191
aS'i started the mann ki baat and people started connecting with it .'
p11192
aS'one of them was shraddha thamban from kerala a grade 12 student .'
p11193
aS'kannur centre invited her for a ceremony and a lot of feedback was received .'
p11194
aS'it created an environment of belonging .'
p11195
aS'kannur centre appreciated the awareness of shraddha and she was rewarded .'
p11196
aS'the development at kannur centre inspired me .'
p11197
aS'i wish all the akashwani centers pay attention to raise the level of awareness among the members and make them active in their region so that our aim of governance with public participation gets a boost .'
p11198
aS'my heartfelt greetings and congratulations to the team at kannur station of akashwani centre for their efforts .'
p11199
aS'i would like to talk about kerala again .'
p11200
aS'the girl students from saint mary upper primary school from chittoor in kerala have sent me a letter .'
p11201
aS'this letter is special in many ways .'
p11202
aS'firstly , these girls have created an image of mother india by thumb prints on a huge piece of cloth .'
p11203
aS'they have sent me the image of mother india .'
p11204
aS'initially i was surprised to see why they created a map of india using thumb prints .'
p11205
aS'but when i read their letter , i realized how beautifully a symbolic message was given .'
p11206
aS'it is not as if these girls have tried to just awaken the prime minister alone .'
p11207
aS'they are trying to create awareness among the people in their region and their mission is organ donation .'
p11208
aS'they are organizing a public awareness campaign for organ donation .'
p11209
aS'they have organized plays for creating an understanding about organ donation .'
p11210
aS'organ donation should become a habit as well as an instinct .'
p11211
aS'they have asked me in their letter to appeal to people about organ donation in mann ki baat .'
p11212
aS'the octogenarian vasantrao sudke guru ji from maharashtra has been running a movement from a long time .'
p11213
aS'he says that organ donation should be a celebrated as a festival .'
p11214
aS'these days i get a lot of messages on phone calls also .'
p11215
aS'devesh from delhi gas also sent me a similar message .'
p11216
aS'i am very happy with the governments initiative on the organ donation and steps towards creating a policy on the same .'
p11217
aS'the country really needs support in these things where people need to go out and help each other and the ambitious target of one per million organ donation is a very productive steps taken by the government .'
p11218
aS'i feel that this topic is very important .'
p11219
aS'the country needs more than 2.'
p11220
aS'5 lakh kidneys , hearts and livers for donation per year .'
p11221
aS'however in a country with 125 crore people ; only 5000 transplants could take place .'
p11222
aS'each year about one lakh eyes are in need of a vision .'
p11223
aS'and we are able to reach upto only 25,000 people who need it .'
p11224
aS'it implies that we are able to provide eye transplant services to only one out of the four needy persons .'
p11225
aS'we should also know that if someone is killed in a road accident , then also the organs can be donated .'
p11226
aS'there are some legal hassles involved .'
p11227
aS'and efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction .'
p11228
aS'by reducing the paper work , some of the states have made a good effort in speeding up the process involved in organ donation .'
p11229
aS'today , i can say that tamil nadu today ranks first in the field of organ donation .'
p11230
aS'many social organizations and ngos are doing commendable job in this direction .'
p11231
aS'national organ and tissue transplant organization ( noto ) has been established to encourage organ transplant .'
p11232
aS'a 24x7 helpline facility is also available .'
p11233
aS'its number is 1800 114 770 .'
p11234
aS"and there is a saying tain tyakten bhunjhita (  what is given by him , allotted to you , you enjoy that '' ) ."
p11235
aS'the joy of sacrifice is beautifully described in this mantra tain tyakten bhunjhita .'
p11236
aS'in the past few days we saw on television that the wife of a poor hawker in delhi received a transplant in delhis g .'
p11237
aS'b .'
p11238
aS'pant hospital .'
p11239
aS'this liver was brought from lucknow by making special arrangements .'
p11240
aS'the transplant was successful .'
p11241
aS'a life was saved .'
p11242
aS'organ donation is the biggest donation .'
p11243
aS'let us all realize the mantra of tain tyakten bhunjhita .'
p11244
aS'dear countrymen , we recently celebrated the festival of navratri and vijayadashmi .'
p11245
aS'and after some days we will celebrate diwali too .'
p11246
aS'we celebrated eid and ganesh chaturthi too .'
p11247
aS'but amongst all these another big festival is being organized which all our countrymen should be proud of .'
p11248
aS'in the national capital of delhi an india africa foreign summit is being organized from 26th to 29th october .'
p11249
aS'for the first time a program of this scale is being organized on the indian soil .'
p11250
aS'leaders of 54 african countries and unions have been invited .'
p11251
aS'this is the biggest conference of african countries outside africa .'
p11252
aS'india-africa ties are deep .'
p11253
aS'the african nations have a population equal to that of india .'
p11254
aS'if both are combined together they make for a third of the world population .'
p11255
aS'and it is said that lakhs of years ago it was all one landmass .'
p11256
aS'later from the indian ocean two parts got separated .'
p11257
aS'there are a lot of similarities amongst us .'
p11258
aS'the bio diversity of both the nations is similar .'
p11259
aS'our natural resources are similar .'
p11260
aS'and almost 27 lakh indians have settled in these nations from a long time .'
p11261
aS'india shares a lot of economic , cultural and political ties with the african nations .'
p11262
aS'but india plays the largest role in training the youth of the african countries .'
p11263
aS'more than 25,000 african youths have studied human resource development and capacity building in india .'
p11264
aS'and many leaders from africa have studied in india .'
p11265
aS'so you can understand the depth of our relationship .'
p11266
aS'and from that perspective this summit is very important .'
p11267
aS'generally when there is a summit , leaders of various countries meet .'
p11268
aS'similarly , in this summit the leaders will be meeting .'
p11269
aS'we are making efforts that the people should also meet .'
p11270
aS'and this time , the government of india , especially the hrd ministry has done something really commendable .'
p11271
aS'an essay competition was organized among all the cbse affiliated schools .'
p11272
aS'a poetry competition was organized to increase their participation .'
p11273
aS'almost 1600 schools participated in the event .'
p11274
aS'it included schools within and outside india .'
p11275
aS'and thousands of children wrote on topics about strengthening the indo africa ties .'
p11276
aS'on the other hand , a mobile exhibition called memories of mahatma starting from his birth place porbandar and travelling through north is about to reach delhi on 29th october .'
p11277
aS'lakhs of school children enjoyed this exhibition .'
p11278
aS'the villagers also had a glimpse .'
p11279
aS'people realized the importance of the role of mahatma gandhi in developing the ties of both india and africa and also the effect of his personality on these nations .'
p11280
aS'some excellent creations were received in this competition .'
p11281
aS'one of the creations drew my attention and i want to share it with you .'
p11282
aS'it reflects the talent , the broad vision and the depth of thoughts of students from small cities .'
p11283
aS'garima gupta from muzzafarnagar , up writes beautifully and says-the river in africa is nile and the name of the sea is red , the continent is huge and the indian diaspora happylike the indus valley is recognition of india civilizationriver nile and carthage are synonymous with african civilizationgandhi ji started his revolution in africahe wove a spell and won everybodys heartbe it johannesburg or kingston , zimbabwe or chadin each african nation , we can find our aloo chatto write , a thousand lines can be written but i want to mention that i love african junglesthe poem is very long , but i have read a few lines to you .'
p11284
aS'though it is an indo africa summit but how this too can become an opportunity to connect people is clearly evident here .'
p11285
aS'i heartily congratulate garima , the students and more than 1600 schools who participated and hrd ministry for this initiative .'
p11286
aS'last time on 15th august i had proposed the sansad adarsh gram yojana .'
p11287
aS'since then , many parliamentarian friends have adopted it .'
p11288
aS'they were deeply involved .'
p11289
aS'last month a workshop was organized in bhopal .'
p11290
aS'all the pradhans , collectors , parliamentarians of villages adopted under adarsh gram , the representatives of indian government and state government , all had an in-depth discussion on this program .'
p11291
aS'many new and encouraging things came to our attention .'
p11292
aS'i would like to bring to your attention a few things .'
p11293
aS'jharkhand , a huge state is primarily tribal .'
p11294
aS'unfortunately whenever one talks of jharkhand what comes to mind is maoism , violence , guns and blood soaked land .'
p11295
aS'many regions in the state have been ruined by these communist terrorists .'
p11296
aS'but the mp from that place , a senior member who has also been our deputy speaker , shri karia munda has dedicated his life for the tribals .'
p11297
aS'he chose parsi gram panchayat from khunti district to be adopted for adarsh gram .'
p11298
aS'it is difficult for government officials to go to places ruled by the maoists .'
p11299
aS'even the doctors can not visit those places .'
p11300
aS'he himself started travelling to this village , to instill faith and give a new lease of life to governmental organizations .'
p11301
aS'he encouraged the officials to visit .'
p11302
aS'he tried to change the mood of despondency and create a mood to achieve something .'
p11303
aS'a successful effort has been made in parsi village to create awareness along with infrastructure and organizational development .'
p11304
aS'i would like to congratulate our honourable parliamentarian sri karia munda ji for the same .'
p11305
aS'i got similar information from andhra too .'
p11306
aS'the mp from andhra sri ashok gajapati raju became involved in this plan and chose dwarapudi gram panchayat from vijaynagram district for the same .'
p11307
aS'other arrangements are in progress , but he did something really innovative .'
p11308
aS'he gave a task to the students in the village school .'
p11309
aS'the new generation in the village is fortunate to be educated but the older generation is not literate .'
p11310
aS'so he asked the students of a higher age group to educate the parents .'
p11311
aS'so in the morning they are students and by evening they become educators .'
p11312
aS'and so , nearly 550 adults were taught by these children and made literate .'
p11313
aS'just see , no budget , no circular , no special arrangements but just will power brought about such a big change .'
p11314
aS'this is amply demonstrated by the dwarapudi gram panchayat .'
p11315
aS'similarly , another respectable parliamentarian sri c.'
p11316
aS'l ruwala ji , he is an mp from mizoram , our north east .'
p11317
aS'he chose khwalahilung village for adarsh gram and ran a special initiative .'
p11318
aS'this village is famous for sugarcane production and a kurtayi jaggery .'
p11319
aS'sri ruwala ji started a sugarcane festival on 11th march .'
p11320
aS'all the people from the region came together for it .'
p11321
aS'senior members from social public life , retired government officials from the region also participated .'
p11322
aS'they put up an exhibition on increasing sugarcane production .'
p11323
aS'they discussed how the village could be made the centre of economic activities and how it could market for its produce .'
p11324
aS'i congratulate ruwala ji for his efforts to make this village not only an adarsh gram but self dependent village too .'
p11325
aS'my dear brothers and sisters , it is not possible that there be an episode of mann ki baat and we do not discuss cleanliness .'
p11326
aS'savita rai from mumbai has sent me a telephonic message - each year on diwali we clean our houses .'
p11327
aS'this diwali let us clean our environment along with our homes and maintain that cleanliness even after diwali .'
p11328
aS'she has drawn attention to this issue .'
p11329
aS'i want to remind you my dear countrymen that last year in our country , the media ran a special campaign and showed all the places where crackers were lying and told that it was not the right thing .'
p11330
aS'this was an awareness campaign launched by the media .'
p11331
aS'as a result of it , soon after diwali a cleanliness drive got initiated all by itself .'
p11332
aS'so what you are saying is true that our concern before and after the festival should be the same .'
p11333
aS'and we should express this concern on every public platform .'
p11334
aS'and today , i especially congratulate all the members of the indian media fraternity .'
p11335
aS'this 2nd october , on gandhi jis anniversary and also on the completion of one year of clean india campaign , i had the fortune of participating in the safaigiri campaign of the india today group .'
p11336
aS'they gave away the clean india awards and i could see several initiatives being carried out .'
p11337
aS'different people were working as one like , one mission .'
p11338
aS'there are so many places in our country that have been kept so clean .'
p11339
aS'all these things were brought to light and i offered my heartfelt appreciation to india today group for their commendable efforts .'
p11340
aS'since the inception of the cleanliness drive i have seen that from andhra and telangana , etv , eanadu have participated whole heartedly and specially sri ramoji rao who is very aged but beats any youth in his enthusiasm .'
p11341
aS'he has made cleanliness his personal program , his mission .'
p11342
aS'he has been promoting the cleanliness program through etv for the past one year .'
p11343
aS'the newspapers carry news about them and he has emphasized on positive news about cleanliness .'
p11344
aS'he has been successful in bringing together around 51 lakh children from 55-56 thousand schools of andhra and telangana to this mission .'
p11345
aS'be it public places , stations , religious places , hospitals , parks or other places , he ran a cleanliness drive .'
p11346
aS'all these news exhibit the power to realize the dream of a clean india .'
p11347
aS'abp news has started a program called ye bharat desh hai mera .'
p11348
aS'in this program they have shown how people have become aware towards cleanliness and through this they are trying to train people about keeping their surroundings clean .'
p11349
aS'ndtv has started a campaign called banega swachh india .'
p11350
aS'dainik jagaran has also encouraged this campaign , so has zee tv and india tv also started mission clean india .'
p11351
aS'thousands of channels and newspapers in our country , i am unable to name them all due to time constraints , but they all have helped run this campaign .'
p11352
aS'this is why , savita rai ji , the suggestion that you have given us ; the whole nation has taken it upon them to do this work and taking it forward .'
p11353
aS'the governor of meghalaya , mr shanmuganthan , wrote me a letter and talked about a village in meghalaya called mavalyannong .'
p11354
aS'he has written that from last many years , this village has set out on a mission for cleanliness and more or less every generation is completely dedicated towards this cause .'
p11355
aS'he has also mentioned that a few years ago they also got the award for the cleanest village of asia .'
p11356
aS'the idea of a far-flung village situated in the north-eastern region in meghalaya , which has been particular about cleanliness since years , makes me extremely happy .'
p11357
aS'this has become the habit and the culture of the village .'
p11358
aS'this is what reinforces our belief that our nation will be clean one day , for sure .'
p11359
aS'this will be possible because of the efforts of the people , and by the time we celebrate the 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi , the 125 crore people of the country should be able to proudly proclaim that we have made india clean .'
p11360
aS'my dear countrymen , i said this from the red fort on the 15th of august that there are few places where corruption is deep rooted .'
p11361
aS'when a poor man goes for an ordinary job , he faces so many problems to get a decent reference and has to go through a team of agents who take money from him in exchange for the position he is applying for .'
p11362
aS'he loses money whether he gets the job or not .'
p11363
aS'we keep hearing things like these and this is when i had an idea , why do we need to interview people for ordinary jobs .'
p11364
aS'i have never heard of any psychologist in the world who can analyze a person completely in a 1-2 minute long interview .'
p11365
aS'with this thought i decided to do away with the tradition of interviews for small positions .'
p11366
aS'my dear young friends , i feel very proud to tell you all that the government has completed all the formalities and now there will not be any interview for the non-gazetted posts of group d , group c , and group b in the central government .'
p11367
aS'this will come into effect from january 1st 2016 .'
p11368
aS'we will not interrupt the ongoing procedures now but from january 1st , 2016 , this will come into play .'
p11369
aS'so , let me congratulate all my young friends for the same .'
p11370
aS'we had , anyways , declared an important scheme in the last budget .'
p11371
aS'in our country , gold has become a part of our social life .'
p11372
aS'gold is considered the medium of financial security .'
p11373
aS'gold is considered to be the solution for difficult times .'
p11374
aS'this has been an age old tradition .'
p11375
aS'i dont believe that anyone can reduce this love for gold that we have developed but keeping gold as dead-money does not suit todays generation .'
p11376
aS'gold can become our strength .'
p11377
aS'it can become our financial strength .'
p11378
aS'gold can become the financial property of the nation and every indian must contribute to this .'
p11379
aS'i am happy that the promise that we made of introducing important schemes , we will do so around diwali and dhanteras when people buy specially buy gold .'
p11380
aS'we have introduced a gold monetization scheme .'
p11381
aS'under this scheme , you can deposit your gold in a bank and the bank will give you interest , same as you deposit your money and get interest from the bank .'
p11382
aS'earlier , we used to keep our gold in the lockers and paid for the lockers ourselves .'
p11383
aS'now , when you keep your gold in the bank , the bank will give you money as interest .'
p11384
aS'now , tell me countrymen , can gold become a property or not ?'
p11385
aS'can gold be converted from dead-money to a live strength or not ?'
p11386
aS'this is exactly what we have to do and you must stand with me .'
p11387
aS'do not keep your gold in your homes .'
p11388
aS'avail dual benefits , its security and interest on the gold .'
p11389
aS'you must avail this opportunity .'
p11390
aS'another thing is , in sovereign gold bonds , you do not really get a physical gold in your hand .'
p11391
aS'you get a sheet of paper and the value of that paper is equivalent to that of the amount of gold and the day you return that paper , you will get the amount that is equivalent to the value of gold on that particular day .'
p11392
aS'let us assume , you buy a gold bond worth rs .'
p11393
aS'1000 and five years later you go to return that bond and at that time the rate of gold is rs .'
p11394
aS'2500 , you will receive an amount of rs .'
p11395
aS'2500 in exchange of that bond .'
p11396
aS'so , we are introducing this scheme now .'
p11397
aS'due to this scheme , we will not have to buy gold now .'
p11398
aS'we will not have to secure our gold now .'
p11399
aS'we will not have to worry about where to put the gold and no one will come to steal the papers .'
p11400
aS'in the coming week , i will certainly put forward this scheme that guarantees security to the people of this country .'
p11401
aS'i feel very glad to tell you that we are also introducing gold coin , a gold coin with ashok chakra .'
p11402
aS'it has been around 70 years of independence but we are still using a foreign gold coin only or the gold bullion bars , these are also used by the foreigners .'
p11403
aS'why should it not have the national emblem of our country ?'
p11404
aS'this is why we are introducing it in the market and it will be available for the citizens in the coming week , before dhanteras - 5gm and 10gm of gold coins with ashok chakra are being introduced .'
p11405
aS'along with it a 20 gm gold gunion will also be available for the people .'
p11406
aS'i have full faith that this new scheme will usher a new change in the financial development of the country and i will get your support in this .'
p11407
aS'my dear countrymen , 31st october is the birth anniversary of the iron-man of india , sardar vallabh bhai patel .'
p11408
aS'ek bharat , shreshtha bharat .'
p11409
aS'a complete layout of india unfolds in front of us when we talk about sardar vallabh bhai patel .'
p11410
aS'this great man has contributed a lot in building the unity of india .'
p11411
aS'he has proven his capabilities as the iron-man of india .'
p11412
aS'we will certainly pay tribute to sardar sahab but along with that his dream of seeing india integrated , he made it possible geographically .'
p11413
aS'but this mantra of unity should be a continuously present in our thoughts in our minds , behaviour and our expressions .'
p11414
aS'india is full of diversities .'
p11415
aS'many sects , communities , languages , castes , attires , and it is this diversity that adds to its charm .'
p11416
aS'if it was not for this diversity , we wouldnt have been this proud of our country .'
p11417
aS'this is why diversity is the mantra of unity .'
p11418
aS'peace , social harmony , unity , these are essential elements of a society .'
p11419
aS'since last many years , run for unity programs have been organized in various parts of the country on the 31st of october .'
p11420
aS'ekta ki daud - i also had a chance to run in one of these earlier .'
p11421
aS'i have heard this year also , this race is being planned at many places .'
p11422
aS'people are excited to be preparing for this race .'
p11423
aS'in the true sense ekta ki daud is the true race for development .'
p11424
aS'in other words , the guarantee for the race of development lies in the race of unity .'
p11425
aS'comelet us pay tribute to sardar sahab .'
p11426
aS'let us take forward the mantra of unity .'
p11427
aS'dear brothers and sisters , you must all be busy in the preparations for diwali , houses must be getting cleaned .'
p11428
aS'you must be shopping for new things .'
p11429
aS'the festival of diwali is celebrated in various ways all over the country .'
p11430
aS'i extend my good wishes to you on this pious festival .'
p11431
aS'we also get to hear of a few accidents around the time of diwali .'
p11432
aS'fire breaks out due to firecrackers or lamps .'
p11433
aS'especially children suffer a lot because of fire crackers .'
p11434
aS'i will suggest all the parents to be careful along with enjoying diwali and see to it that the kids should not get hurt or any untoward incident should not happen and we lose our child due to accidents .'
p11435
aS'i know you will be careful about this and of course about keeping the environment clean .'
p11436
aS'my dear countrymen , i have to leave for a trip to britain on the next day of diwali .'
p11437
aS'i am very excited about my britain trip this time .'
p11438
aS'there is a reason behind my excitement .'
p11439
aS'a few weeks back i went to mumbai to inaugurate a magnificent memorial of dr.'
p11440
aS'baba bhimrao ambedkar near his chaitya bhoomi .'
p11441
aS'now , i am going to london to formally inaugurate the house where babasaheb used to stay , which has now become the property of india , an inspiration for 125 crore countrymen .'
p11442
aS'be it a dalit , an underprivileged , a victim , a bereaved , or any indian who is leading a difficult life .'
p11443
aS'this house inspires us to believe in the fact that if one has a strong will power , we can overcome the difficulties to tread on the path of success , one can get educated and this is the very place where babasaheb ambedkar used to meditate .'
p11444
aS'the indian government and the government of different indian states give scholarships to such promising students who go abroad to study and who belong to the dalit community , the tribal community or any other under privileged community .'
p11445
aS'i believe that when these kids go to britain to study , this memorial of babasaheb will become a pilgrimage for them , it will become a source of inspiration .'
p11446
aS'whatever you learn in life , you must use it later for the nation and live for your nation , babasaheb gave this message and even lived it himself .'
p11447
aS'this is why i am saying that i am very excited about my britain trip this time .'
p11448
aS'this issue has been lying entangled since many years , now it has become the property of 125 crore countrymen and if the name of babasaheb ambedkar is attached , you can imagine how happy it makes me .'
p11449
aS'i am going to get another opportunity in london , the unveiling of the statue of lord vishweshwara .'
p11450
aS'many years ago , what lord vishweshwara had done for democracy and empowerment of women can make for a very good subject to study in the world .'
p11451
aS'the unveiling of the statue of lord vishweshwara on the land of london is in itself a perfect example of the fact that the great men of india were very far-sighted .'
p11452
aS'now you see , when such incidents are connected , how excited we get .'
p11453
aS'my dear countrymen , you are connected with us through mann ki baat .'
p11454
aS'i keep getting your suggestions through telephone and mygov .'
p11455
aS'in .'
p11456
aS'your letters are also discussed on akashvani .'
p11457
aS'government officials are called in and discussions are held .'
p11458
aS'some people write down their grievances , there are efforts to solve their problems as well .'
p11459
aS'we should learn more than one language in a country like india .'
p11460
aS'i am fortunate enough to have learned a few languages , but still there are so many languages that i could not learn .'
p11461
aS'i am indebted to akashvani because they broadcast this program of mann ki baat by 8 oclock in every state in their regional languages .'
p11462
aS'even though a different voice is used but the thoughts are mine .'
p11463
aS'i will try to make it reach out to you in your language .'
p11464
aS'we have formed a beautiful bond between us .'
p11465
aS'last time i had completed a year in power .'

p11473
aS'to our visitors from the land where history began , humanity grew and new hope rises ; from the deserts of the north , where the glory of human civilization shines through the shifting sands of time ; from the south , where the conscience of our age has been forged from mahatma gandhi to albert luthuli to nelson mandela ; from the shores of atlantic that has been at historys tragic crossroads and now at the frontiers of many successes ; from our neighbours on the resurgent east coast ; from africas heart , where nature is generous and culture is rich ; and , from the sparkling gems of island states ; a very warm embrace of welcome and friendship from india .'

aS'we are among the worlds oldest civilisations .'
p11480
aS'we are each a vibrant mosaic of languages , religions and cultures .'
p11481
aS'our histories have intersected since ages .'
p11482
aS'once united by geography , we are now linked by the indian ocean .'
p11483
aS'the currents of the mighty ocean have nurtured the ties of kinship , commerce , and culture through centuries .'
p11484
aS'generations of indians and africans have travelled to each others land in search of their destiny or by the force of circumstances .'
p11485
aS'either way , we have enriched each other and strengthened our ties .'
p11486
aS'we have lived in the long shadow of colonialism .'
p11487
aS'and , we have fought for our liberty and our dignity .'
p11488
aS'we have struggled for opportunity , and also for justice , which , the african wisdom describes , is the prime condition of humanity .'
p11489
aS'we have spoken in one voice in the world ; and , we have formed a partnership for prosperity among ourselves .'
p11490
aS'we have stood together under blue helmets to keep peace .'
p11491
aS'and , we have fought together against hunger and disease .'
p11492
aS'and , as we look to the future , there is something precious that unites us : it is our youth .'
p11493
aS'two-thirds of india and two-thirds of africa is under the age of 35 years .'
p11494
aS'and , if the future belongs to the youth , then this century is ours to shape and build .'
p11495
aS'excellencies , africa is already on that path .'
p11496
aS'we are all familiar with africas ancient achievements .'
p11497
aS'now , its modern strides are catching the attention of the world .'
p11498
aS'the continent is more settled and stable .'
p11499
aS'african nations are coming together to take responsibility for their development , peace and security .'
p11500
aS'african struggles and sacrifices are upholding democracy , combating extremism and empowering women .'
p11501
aS'women now constitute around 20 % of the elected members of parliament in africa .'
p11502
aS'to one who has played a role in that , president sirleaf , i extend our best wishes on your birthday today .'
p11503
aS'africas economic growth has gathered momentum and has a more diversified base .'
p11504
aS'african initiatives are replacing old fault lines with new bridges of regional economic integration .'
p11505
aS'we see many successful examples of economic reforms , infrastructure development and sustainable use of resources .'
p11506
aS'they are turning adrift economies into dynamic ones .'
p11507
aS'four hundred thousand new businesses were registered in africa in 2013 ; and , mobile telephone now reaches 95 % of the population in many places .'
p11508
aS'africa is now joining the global mainstream of innovation .'
p11509
aS'the mobile banking of m-pesa , the healthcare innovation of medafrica , or the agriculture innovation of agrimanagr and kilimo salama , are using mobile and digital technology to transform lives in africa .'
p11510
aS'we see strong measures that are radically improving healthcare , education and agriculture .'
p11511
aS'primary school enrolment in africa now exceeds 90 % .'
p11512
aS'and , across its magnificent landscape , africa is setting standards in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism .'
p11513
aS'africas sports , art and music delight the entire world .'
p11514
aS'yes , africa , like the rest of the developing world , has its development challenges .'
p11515
aS'and , like others in the world , it has its own concerns of security and stability , especially from terrorism and extremism .'
p11516
aS'but , i have confidence in african leadership and the african people to rise to those challenges .'
p11517
aS'excellencies , for the past six decades , so much of our independent journeys have been together .'
p11518
aS'now , so much of indias development priorities and africas lofty vision for its future are aligned .'
p11519
aS'today , africa and india are two bright spots of hope and opportunities in the global economy .'
p11520
aS'india is honoured to be a development partner for africa .'
p11521
aS'it is a partnership beyond strategic concerns and economic benefits .'
p11522
aS'it is formed from the emotional bonds we share and the solidarity we feel for each other .'
p11523
aS'in less than a decade , our trade has more than doubled to over 70 billion dollars .'
p11524
aS'india is now a major source of business investments in africa .'
p11525
aS'today , 34 african countries enjoy duty free access to the indian market .'
p11526
aS'african energy helps run the engine of the indian economy ; its resources are powering our industries ; and , african prosperity offers growing market for indian products .'
p11527
aS'india has committed 7.'
p11528
aS'4 billion dollars in concessional credit and 1.'
p11529
aS'2 billion dollars in grant since the first india-africa summit in 2008 .'
p11530
aS'it is creating 100 capacity building institutions , and developing infrastructure , public transport , clean energy , irrigation , agriculture and manufacturing capacity across africa .'
p11531
aS'in the last three years alone , nearly 25,000 young africans have been trained and educated in india .'
p11532
aS'they are the 25,000 new links between us .'
p11533
aS'excellencies , there are times when we have not done as well as you have wanted us to .'
p11534
aS'there have been occasions when we have not been as attentive as we should be .'
p11535
aS'there are commitments we have not fulfilled as quickly as we should have .'
p11536
aS'but , you have always embraced india with warmth , and without judgement .'
p11537
aS'you have rejoiced in our success , and taken pride in our achievements .'
p11538
aS'and , you have stood for us in the world .'
p11539
aS'this is the strength of our partnership and our friendship .'
p11540
aS'and , as we travel on the road ahead , we will do so with the wisdom of our experience and the benefit of your guidance .'
p11541
aS'we will raise the level of our support for your vision of a prosperous , integrated , and united africa that is a major partner for the world .'
p11542
aS'we will help connect africa from cairo to cape town , from marakesh to mombassa ; help develop your infrastructure , power and irrigation ; help add value to your resources in africa ; and , set up industrial and information technology parks .'
p11543
aS'excellencies , as the great nigerian nobel laureate wole soyinka insisted , human entity remains the primary asset in overall development .'
p11544
aS'our approach is based on the same belief : that the best partnership is one that develops human capital and institutions ; that equips and empowers a nation to have the freedom to make its own choices and shoulder the responsibility for its own progress .'
p11545
aS'it also opens doors to opportunities for the youth .'
p11546
aS'so , development of human capital in every walk of life will be at the heart of our partnership .'
p11547
aS'we will open our doors more ; we will expand tele-education ; and we will continue to build institutions in africa .'
p11548
aS'the egyptian nobel prize winning writer naguib mahfouz said , science brings people together with the light of its ideasand prods us towards a better future .'
p11549
aS'there can be no better expression of the ability of science to unify people and advance progress .'
p11550
aS'so , technology will be a strong foundation of our partnership .'
p11551
aS'it will help develop africas agriculture sector .'
p11552
aS'africa has 60 % of the worlds arable land reserves , and just 10 % of the global output .'
p11553
aS'agriculture in africa can drive the continents march to prosperity , and also support global food security .'
p11554
aS'indias expertise in healthcare and affordable medicines can offer new hope in the fight against many diseases ; and give a newborn a better chance to survive .'
p11555
aS'we will also collaborate to develop indian and african treasures of traditional knowledge and medicines .'
p11556
aS'we will make available our space assets and technology .'
p11557
aS'we will use the possibilities of digital technology to transform development , public services , governance , disaster response , resource management and quality of life .'
p11558
aS'we will expand and extend the pan africa e-network , conceived by late president apj abdul kalam , which links 48 african countries to india and to each other .'
p11559
aS'this will alsohelp set up your pan africa virtual university .'
p11560
aS'we will work to reduce digital divide within africa and between africa and rest of the world .'
p11561
aS'we will cooperate for sustainable development of blue economy that will become important future drivers of our prosperity .'
p11562
aS'for me , blue economy is part of a larger blue revolution to reclaim our blue skies and blue waters , as we move on the path of clean development .'
p11563
aS'excellencies , when the sun sets , tens of millions of homes in india and africa become dark .'
p11564
aS'we want to light up lives of our people and power their future .'
p11565
aS'but , we want to do it in a way that the snow on kilimanjaro does not disappear , the glacier that feeds the river ganges does not retreat and our islands are not doomed .'
p11566
aS'no one has done less to contribute to global warming than india and africa .'
p11567
aS'no one can be more conscious of climate change than indians and africans .'
p11568
aS'this is because we are the inheritors of natures most precious gifts , and of traditions that respect them the most ; and , our lives remain most connected to mother earth .'
p11569
aS'we are each making enormous efforts with our modest resources to combat climate change .'
p11570
aS'for india , 175 gigawatts of additional renewable energy capacity by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity by 33-35 % by 2030 are just two aspects of our efforts .'
p11571
aS'we will also deepen india-africa partnership on clean energy , sustainable habitats , public transport and climate resilient agriculture .'
p11572
aS'but , it is also true that the excess of few can not become the burden of many .'
p11573
aS'so , when the world meets in paris in december , we look to see a comprehensive and concrete outcome that is based on the well established principles in the un convention on climate change .'
p11574
aS'we will all do our part for it .'
p11575
aS'but , we also want to see a genuine global public partnership that makes clean energy affordable ; provides finance and technology to developing countries to access it ; and the means to adapt to the impact of climate change .'
p11576
aS'i also invite you to join an alliance of solar-rich countries that i have proposed to launch in paris on november 30 at the time of cop-21 meeting .'
p11577
aS'our goal is to make solar energy an integral part of our life and reach it to the most unconnected villages and communities .'
p11578
aS'india and africa seek also seek a global trading regime that serves our development goals and improves our trade prospects .'
p11579
aS'when we meet at nairobi ministerial of the wto in december , we must ensure that the doha development agenda of 2001 is not closed without achieving these fundamental objectives .'
p11580
aS'we should also achieve a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security and special safeguard mechanism in agriculture for the developing countries .'
p11581
aS'excellencies , this is a milestone year when we are setting the agenda for our future and celebrating the 70th anniversary of the united nations .'
p11582
aS'the world is undergoing political , economic , technological and security transition on a scale and speed rarely seen in recent history .'
p11583
aS'yet our global institutions reflect the circumstances of the century that we left behind , not the one we are in today .'
p11584
aS'these institutions have served us well , but unless they adjust to the changing world , they risk becoming irrelevant .'
p11585
aS'we can not say what will replace them in an uncertain future .'
p11586
aS'but , we might have a more fragmented world that is less capable of dealing with the challenges of our era .'
p11587
aS'that is why india advocates reforms in global institutions .'
p11588
aS'this is a world of free nations and awakened aspirations .'
p11589
aS'our institutions can not be representative of our world , if they do not give voice to africa , with more than a quarter of un members , or the worlds largest democracy with one-sixth of humanity .'
p11590
aS'that is why india and africa must speak in one voice for reforms of the united nations , including its security council .'
p11591
aS'excellencies , today , in many parts of the world , the light of a bright future flickers in the storm of violence and instability .'
p11592
aS'when terror snuffs out life on the streets and beaches , and in malls and schools of africa , we feel your pain as our own .'
p11593
aS'and , we see the links that unite us against this threat .'
p11594
aS'we also see that when our oceans are no longer safe for trade , we all suffer together .'
p11595
aS'and , when nations are caught in conflict within , no one around remains untouched .'
p11596
aS'and , we know that our cyber networks bring opportunities , but also carry huge risks .'
p11597
aS'so , when it comes to security , distance no longer insulates us from each other .'
p11598
aS'that is why we wish to deepen our cooperation in maritime security and hydrography , and countering terrorism and extremism ; and , why we must have a un comprehensive convention on international terrorism .'
p11599
aS'we will also provide support for africa unions peacekeeping efforts .'
p11600
aS'and , we will train african peacekeepers here and in africa .'
p11601
aS'we must also have a stronger voice in decisions on un peacekeeping missions .'
p11602
aS'excellencies , from connecting lives to collaborating for our prosperity , from keeping our people safe to advancing our global interests , the agenda of our partnership stretches across the vast territory of our linked aspirations .'
p11603
aS'to add strength to our partnership , india will offer concessional credit of 10 billion u .'
p11604
aS's.'
p11605
aS'dollars over the next five years .'
p11606
aS'this will be in addition to our ongoing credit programme .'
p11607
aS'we will also offer a grant assistance of 600 million u .'
p11608
aS's.'
p11609
aS'dollars .'
p11610
aS'this will include an india-africa development fund of 100 million u .'
p11611

p11617
aS'excellencies , if this century is going to be one in which all humans have a life of opportunity , equality and dignity ; stand in peace with each other ; and live in balance with nature , then india and africa must rise together .'
p11618
aS'we will work together : from the memory of our common struggles ; and , the tide of our collective hopes ; from the richness of our heritage ; and , the commitment to our planet ; from the pledge to our people ; and , the faith in our future ; from the generosity of the african saying that a small home can hold hundred friends ; from the spirit of indias ancient belief : that great souls are always taking the initiatives to do good to others ; from the inspiration of mandelas call to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others .'
p11619
aS'today , we pledge to walk together , with our steps in rhythm and our voices in harmony .'
p11620
aS'this is not a new journey , nor a new beginning .'
p11621
aS'but , this is a new promise of a great future for an ancient relationship .'

S'my colleagues in government , friends and distinguished guests from india and abroad , i am happy , to be here today , to address the sixth delhi economics conclave .'
p11627
aS'this is a good platform for bringing together economists , policy-makers , and thought-leaders , from india and abroad .'
p11628
aS'i compliment the ministry of finance for organising it .'
p11629
aS'your topic of discussion is jam , that is , jan dhan yojana , aadhaar and mobile .'
p11630
aS'this jam vision , will serve as the bedrock of many initiatives to come .'
p11631
aS'for me , jam is about just achieving maximum .'
p11632
aS'maximum value for every rupee spentmaximum empowerment for our poormaximum technology penetration among the massesbut let me start by taking a brief look at the indian economy .'
p11633
aS'by almost every major economic indicator , india is doing better , than when we took office 17 months ago.'
p11634
aS'- gdp growth is up and inflation is down .'
p11635
aS'- foreign investment is up and the current account deficit is down .'
p11636
aS'- revenues are up and interest rates are down .'
p11637
aS'- the fiscal deficit is down and the rupee is stable .'
p11638
aS'obviously , this did not happen by accident .'
p11639
aS'and the world economy is not exactly doing well .'
p11640
aS'this success , is the result of a series of well thought out policies .'
p11641
aS'many of the purely macro economic reforms we have undertaken , are probably well known to this audience .'
p11642
aS'we have embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation .'
p11643
aS'we have entered for the first time into a monetary framework agreement , with the reserve bank to curb inflation .'
p11644
aS'even while cutting the fiscal deficit we havesubstantially increased productive public investment .'
p11645
aS'this has been made possible in two ways .'
p11646
aS'firstly , we have imposed , carbon taxes on fossil fuels .'
p11647
aS'we took the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies .'
p11648
aS'we have replaced them with taxes .'
p11649
aS'the coal cess has been increased by four times from rs 50 per ton to rs 200 per ton .'
p11650
aS'globally , there is much talk of carbon taxes but much of it is just that - talk .'
p11651
aS'we have actually acted .'
p11652
aS'secondly , wehave reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods like the use of technology .'
p11653
aS'some of the methods , are part of your agenda , such as using aadhaar to target subsidies to the deserving .'
p11654
aS'these are reforms that you are probably aware of .'
p11655
aS'but our reforms are far broader , and far deeper , than is generally recognised .'
p11656
aS'before i elaborate on this , i would like to raise two issues .'
p11657
aS'the first is , reform for what ?'
p11658
aS'what is the aim of reform ?'
p11659
aS'is it just to increase the measured rate of gdp growth ?'
p11660
aS'or is it to bring about a transformation in society ?'
p11661
aS'my answer is clear .'
p11662
aS'we must reform to transform .'
p11663
aS'the second question is , reform for whom ?'
p11664
aS'who is the target audience ?'
p11665
aS'is our aim to impress groups of experts and score points in intellectual discussions ?'
p11666
aS'or to achieve ranks in some international league table ?'
p11667
aS'again , my answer is clear .'
p11668
aS'reform is that which helps all citizens , and especially the poor , achieve a better life .'
p11669
aS'it is sabka saath , sabka vikas .'
p11670
aS'in short , reform is not an end in itself .'
p11671
aS'reform for me , is just a way station on the long journey to the destination .'
p11672
aS'the destination is transformation of india .'
p11673
aS'therefore , reform to transform .'
p11674
aS'and reforming to transform , is a marathon , not a sprint .'
p11675
aS'the reforms we have undertaken , are of many types .'
p11676
aS'for simplicity , i will classify them as financial , structural and institutional .'
p11677
aS'it will not be possible for me to cover all of them here .'
p11678
aS'but i will certainly mention some of the most important .'
p11679
aS'let me start with the financial reforms .'
p11680
aS'we talk often about interest rates and credit policy .'
p11681
aS'changes in interest rates are debated for months .'
p11682
aS'tons of newsprint and hours of television are spent on it .'
p11683
aS'interest rates are no doubt very important .'
p11684
aS'but are they important to a person locked out of the banking system ?'
p11685
aS'to a person who has no prospect of ever lending or borrowing from a bank ?'
p11686
aS'and if large sections of a country are in this position then how important areinterest rates ?'
p11687
aS'it is for this reason that development experts have been advocating financial inclusion .'
p11688
aS'what we have done in the last 17 months is to bring one hundred and ninety million people into the banking system .'
p11689
aS'this is more than the population of most of the countries in the world .'
p11690
aS'now these millions are part of our banking system , and words like interest rate have a meaning for them .'
p11691
aS'not only have these people been brought into the system but they have shown that there is great strength at the bottom of the pyramid .'
p11692
aS'believe it or not , accounts opened under the jan dhan yojana today have a total balance of almost rs .'
p11693
aS'26,000 crores or nearly four billion dollars .'
p11694
aS'clearly our financial inclusion reform has been transformational .'
p11695
aS'and yet this quiet revolution has hardly been noticed .'
p11696
aS'the jan dhan yojana has also transformed the ability of the poor to make and to receive electronic payments .'
p11697
aS'every jan dhan account holder is eligible for a debit card .'
p11698
aS'indias banks are also being encouraged to operate mobile atms .'
p11699
aS'a mobile atm is one where cash can be drawn and simple banking tasks done through a hand held device .'
p11700
aS'thanks to jan dhan yojana and the rupay debit card , we have also introduced healthy competition in the debit-credit card space .'
p11701
aS'this has traditionally been dominated by a few international players .'
p11702
aS'even one year ago , there were hardly any indigenous card brands in the market .'
p11703
aS'today , 36 % of debit cards in india are ru-pay cards .'
p11704
aS'financial inclusion is not just about opening bank accounts or enabling electronic payments .'
p11705
aS'i firmly believe , that india has tremendous entrepreneurial energy .'
p11706
aS'this needs to be harnessed so that we become a nation of job-creators , rather than job seekers .'
p11707
aS'when we took office , we found that 58 million non-corporate enterprises provided one 128 million jobs .'
p11708
aS'60 % of them were in rural areas .'
p11709
aS'over 40 % were owned by people from the backward classes and 15 % by scheduledcastes and tribes .'
p11710
aS'but bank credit accounted for a tiny share of their financing .'
p11711
aS'most of them never get any bank credit .'
p11712
aS'in other words the most employment-intensive sector of the economy gets the least credit !'
p11713
aS'while jan dhan yojana was to bring banking to the unbanked the second reform was to bring funding to the unfunded .'
p11714
aS'we are creating a new financing and regulatory architecture under the micro-units development and refinance agency scheme popularly known asmudra .'
p11715
aS'already under the pradhan mantri mudra yojana banks have provided more than six million loans to small businesses for a total value of nearly rs 38,000 crores or six billion dollars .'
p11716
aS'if one conservatively estimates that each loan creates 2 jobs we have laid the foundation for 12 million new jobs .'
p11717
aS'even rs two hundred thousand crores invested in the corporate sector would not produce this many jobs .'
p11718
aS'we have now launched a programme where each branch ofeach bank that is a total of 125,000 bank branches will assist one dalit or a scheduled tribe person and one woman in starting a business .'
p11719
aS'we are also creating an environment that fosters innovation and start-ups through the atal innovation mission and the self employment and talent utilisation programme .'
p11720
aS'another financial reform is the provision of a safety net through new social security schemes .'
p11721
aS'we have introduced three non-subsidised but low cost schemes covering accident insurance life insurance and pensions .'
p11722
aS'because of their massive coverage the premia are low .'
p11723
aS'there are now over 120 million subscribers .'
p11724
aS'for many of these reforms to be successful we need a strong banking system .'
p11725
aS'we inherited a system where cronyism and corruption were believed to be rampant in banking decisions and in appointments to public sector banks .'
p11726
aS'after the first ever retreat of a prime minister with bankers , known as the gyan sangam , we have moved decisively to change this .'
p11727
aS'major steps have been taken to improve efficiency , including clear performance measures and accountability mechanisms .'
p11728
aS'we havemade a commitment to ensuring adequate capital .'
p11729
aS'but more than that there have been very powerful non-financial steps .'
p11730
aS'interference in banking decisions has ended .'
p11731
aS'a new process for appointments is being put in place under the bank boards bureau .'
p11732
aS'credible and capable bankers have been appointed to head banks .'
p11733
aS'for the first time since banks were nationalised 46 years ago private sector professionals have been appointed in key positions .'
p11734
aS'this is a major reform .'
p11735
aS'there is a whole eco-system focused on alleviating poverty .'
p11736
aS'perhaps this can be called the poverty alleviation industry .'
p11737
aS'obviously the intentions are good .'
p11738
aS'well designed schemes and subsidies do have an important place .'
p11739
aS'but empowering the poor is far more effective than empowering the poverty alleviation industry .'
p11740
aS'our financial reforms empower the poor to fight poverty themselves .'
p11741
aS'i can take the analogy of a house .'
p11742
aS'the foundation and basic structure occupies someof the costs .'
p11743
aS'then come the fixtures , fittings and furniture .'
p11744
aS'if the foundation and structure are weak any investment in nice fittings or attractive floor tiles or beautiful curtains is unlikely to last long .'
p11745
aS'so also , empowering the poor through financial inclusion and social security will provide a more stable and lasting solution .'
p11746
aS'let me now turn to structural reforms in various sectors .'
p11747
aS'agriculture remains indias mainstay in terms of providing livelihood .'
p11748
aS'we have introduced a series of reforms .'
p11749
aS'there was a tendency to divert subsidised fertiliser for the production of chemicals .'
p11750
aS'a simple but very effective solution is neem-coating of fertiliser which makes it unsuitable for diversion .'
p11751
aS'this had been tried on a small scale earlier .'
p11752
aS'we are now moving towards universal neem-coating of urea .'
p11753
aS'this has already saved crores of rupees of diverted farm subsidies .'
p11754
aS'it is an example of how simple reforms can be very effective .'
p11755
aS'we have introduced a soil health card nationally which tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil .'
p11756
aS'it enables the farmer to choose the right quantity and mix of inputs .'
p11757
aS'this greatly reduces wastage of inputs and increases crop yield besides protecting the soil .'
p11758
aS'by reducing unnecessary chemical inputs , it is also good for health of consumers .'
p11759
aS'it enables farmers to choose the best crop for their soil .'
p11760
aS'many farmers have been unaware that their land is actually more suitedfor a different crop .'
p11761
aS'in economic terms , it is a win-win-win-win .'
p11762
aS'it reduces costs , increases yields , improves the environment and protects the health of consumers .'
p11763
aS'140 million soil health cards will be issued , requiring a collection of over twenty-five million soil samples .'
p11764
aS'they will be tested through a nationwide network of nearly 1500 laboratories .'
p11765
aS'about four million samples have already been collected .'
p11766
aS'this too is a reform to transform .'
p11767
aS'we have launched a housing for all program - one of the most ambitious in the world .'
p11768
aS'it involves building twenty million urban houses and thirty million rural houses , totalling nearly fifty million .'
p11769
aS'the programme will make sure no indian is houseless .'
p11770
aS'it will also generate a large amount of employment mainly for the unskilled the semi-skilled and the poor .'
p11771
aS'this multi-pronged program is also a transformative reform .'
p11772
aS'much has been said and written about indias labour markets .'
p11773
aS'we have already undertaken some important steps .'
p11774
aS'many workers in the organised sector have suffered when changing jobs by being unable to access provident fund and other benefits .'
p11775
aS'the benefits accrued under one employer become difficult to account for under another employer .'
p11776
aS'we have introduced a universal account number which will remain with an employee even when he changes jobs .'
p11777
aS'this greatly improves labour mobility and makes life easier for employers and employees .'
p11778
aS'we have gone a step further we have started empowering the unorganised sector employees by giving them a universal identity number and providing certain minimum social security benefits to them .'
p11779
aS'over a period of years , this will have a major impact on the quality of employment in india .'
p11780
aS'before becoming prime minister , i had received many inputs about the reforms needed in india from many economic experts .'
p11781
aS'however , none of them touched on the issue of cleanliness and sanitation .'
p11782
aS'sanitation has languished for years as a poor cousin of health or of drinking water supply .'
p11783
aS'it has often been viewed as a question of budgets and projects and expenditure .'
p11784
aS'yet , you will all agree that poor sanitation and lack of cleanliness is much more than anissue of health .'
p11785
aS'it touches upon every aspect of our well-being .'
p11786
aS'it is of particular importance to women .'
p11787
aS'our swacch bharat or clean india campaign will impact not only health and sanitation but also uplift the status and security of women and above all create a powerful sense of well-being .'
p11788
aS'if this reform succeeds , as i am confident it will , india would have been transformed .'
p11789
aS'we have undertaken major managerial improvements in the transport sector .'
p11790
aS'our major ports have seen a 5 % growth in traffic and an 11 % increase in operating income in 2014-15 despite a global contraction in trade volume .'
p11791
aS'the shipping corporation of india had been making losses continuously for several years and had a loss of rs .'
p11792
aS'275 crores in 2013-14 .'
p11793
aS'in 2014-15 it earned a profit of rs 201 crores a turnaround of nearly rs 500 crores in one year .'
p11794
aS'the pace ofaward of new highway works has increased from 5.'
p11795
aS'2 km per day in 2012-13 and 8.'
p11796
aS'7 km per day in 2013-14 to 23.'
p11797
aS'4 km per day currently .'
p11798
aS'these managerial reforms in the working of the public sector will have large multiplier effects throughout the economy .'
p11799
aS'another measure we have taken is to identify what can be called dead money and use it productively .'
p11800
aS'the best example is gold .'
p11801
aS'india is well known for its cultural affinity for gold .'
p11802
aS'as economists you will probably understand that this so-called cultural affinity has a strong economic logic .'
p11803
aS'india has often witnessed high inflation .'
p11804
aS'gold is an excellent hedge against inflation and is a highly portable store of value .'
p11805
aS'its portability and usability , also make it a sourceof empowerment of women who traditionally are the main owners of gold jewellery .'
p11806
aS'however , this micro-economic virtue , can become a macro-economic vice .'
p11807
aS'it implies a high level of gold imports .'
p11808
aS'we have just launched a series of gold-related schemes .'
p11809
aS'these will provide indians with the inflation protection of gold along with a modest interest without actually holding it .'
p11810
aS'if the scheme reaches its potential , it will help meet the rational expectations of the public whilemoderating imports .'
p11811
aS'surely , this too is an important reform with potential to transform .'
p11812
aS'let me now turn to institutional and governance reforms .'
p11813
aS'for years , the planning commission was widely criticised .'
p11814
aS'it was generally seen as a cumbersome centralising force which imposed central will on the states .'
p11815
aS'it is another matter that some of its strongest critics suddenly developed a nostalgic admiration for the institution they had hated till the previous day .'
p11816
aS'after coming to power we created a new institution , the national institution for transforming india , or niti .'
p11817
aS'my vision of niti is very different from theplanning commission .'
p11818
aS'it is to be a collaborative forum for ideas and action where states are full partners and where centre and states meet in a spirit of co-operative federalism .'
p11819
aS'perhaps some people thought this was merely a slogan .'
p11820
aS'but we already have concrete examples of its transformative power .'
p11821
aS'let me explain .'
p11822
aS'as you all know , the 14th finance commission recommended that states be given an enhanced share of central revenues as automatic devolution .'
p11823
aS'despite some internal advice to the contrary , i decided to accept the recommendation .'
p11824
aS'this has created a need to restructure centrally sponsored schemes .'
p11825
aS'ever since the first five year plan in 1952 , such decisions were taken unilaterally by the centre .'
p11826
aS'we did something very different .'
p11827
aS'the task of fixing the sharingpattern of central schemes was entrusted not to a group of central ministers but to a sub-group of chief ministers in niti .'
p11828
aS'and i am delighted to say , that in a fine example of co-operative federalism at its best , the chief ministers have unanimously agreed on a set of recommendations .'
p11829
aS'this is despite the fact that this is a very complex issue , and that they come from many different political parties .'
p11830
aS'i received their report , on 27th october .'
p11831
aS'the main recommendationon the sharing pattern was accepted the very same day and written instructions were issued the very next day .'
p11832
aS'on many other issues too , the chief ministers are taking the lead in setting the national agenda .'
p11833
aS'by reforming the institution , we have transformed the relationship .'
p11834
aS'our work on make in india and ease of doing business is of course well known .'
p11835
aS'our push to make in india must be viewed in the context of the very slow growth in world trade .'
p11836
aS'the growth rate of trade exceeded gdp growth from 1983 to 2008 .'
p11837
aS'since then , trade has been growing more slowly than gdp .'
p11838
aS'therefore , producing for domestic consumption is important for growth .'
p11839
aS'you are all probably aware , that india has substantially improved its ranking in the world banks doing business survey .'
p11840
aS'but a new feature , is the very healthy and constructive competition among states .'
p11841
aS'you would be surprised to know , that among the top few states are jharkhand , chattisgarh and odisha .'
p11842
aS'this is an example of constructive competitive federalism .'
p11843
aS'in a break with over sixty-five years of tradition we have involved states even in foreign policy .'
p11844
aS'the ministry of external affairs has been asked to work with the states .'
p11845
aS'when i visited china , a state-to-state summit was also held .'
p11846
aS'and states have been asked to create export promotion councils .'
p11847
aS'making the states think globally is yet another reform with potential to transform .'
p11848
aS'i firmly believe that indias people are far more mature and far more public-spirited than arm-chair critics and experts give them credit for .'
p11849
aS'an important governance issue is the mutual trust between citizens and the state .'
p11850
aS'we made a beginning in trusting the citizens by abolishing many requirements for attestation of signatures .'
p11851
aS'for example , the department of higher education , has permitted self attestation by students of documents used for admission invarious academic courses .'
p11852
aS'we also ended the requirement to visit government offices for life certification for pensioners by introducing online biometric identification .'
p11853
aS'economists have traditionally believed that people act in their self interest .'
p11854
aS'but india has a long tradition of voluntarism .'
p11855
aS'we introduced the give-it-up campaign seeking the cooperation of the public in voluntarily giving up cooking gas subsidies .'
p11856
aS'we promised them that for everyconnection given up one poor family currently without gas would be given a connection .'
p11857
aS'this will enable us to liberate many poor women from the health hazards of using firewood including respiratory illness .'
p11858
aS'the response has been tremendous .'
p11859
aS'within a few months over four million indians have given up their cooking gas subsidies .'
p11860
aS'most of them are not rich households and belong to the lower middle class .'
p11861
aS'if any of you in this room still have a subsidised connectionlet me appeal to you to join them .'
p11862
aS'this brings me to an achievement that i think even our worst critics do not dispute .'
p11863
aS'this is the change in levels of corruption .'
p11864
aS'for many years , economists and other experts have held corruption to be one of the main constraints on the growth of any developing economy .'
p11865
aS'we have taken decisive steps to curb corruption .'
p11866
aS'i have already referred to what has been done in public sector banks .'
p11867
aS'another major reform is well known .'
p11868
aS'this is the removal of discretion inallocation of key resources .'
p11869
aS'our auctions of coal spectrum and fm radio licences have produced major additional revenues .'
p11870
aS'in the case of coal the major beneficiaries are some of indias poorest states , who will now have much more resources for development .'
p11871
aS'interviews for lower level government jobs have widely been seen , as a source of corruption .'
p11872
aS'we have recently abolished the system of interviews for lower level posts in government .'
p11873
aS'we will rely on transparent writtenexamination results to decide who will be selected .'
p11874
aS'our campaign against tax evasion and money laundering is also well known .'
p11875
aS'rs .'
p11876
aS'6500 crores has been assessed before the new black money act was implemented .'
p11877
aS'additionally , over rs 4000 crores has been declared under the new act .'
p11878
aS'thus over rs 10,500 crores of black money from abroad has been detected and assessed .'
p11879
aS'if we can sustain this improvement in integrity and transparency what can be a more transformative reform ?'
p11880
aS'we are also taking several steps to serve the honest taxpayer better .'
p11881
aS'electronic filing of returns now covers 85 % of all tax returns .'
p11882
aS'earlier , electronic returns had to be followed by a paper verification which used to take weeks to be processed .'
p11883
aS'this year , we have introduced e-verification using aadhaar and over four million taxpayers made use of this facility .'
p11884
aS'for them , the entire process was simple , electronic and completed instantly with no paper at all .'
p11885
aS'this year , 91 % ofelectronic returns were processed within ninety days as compared to 46 % last year .'
p11886
aS'nearly 90 % of refunds were issued within 90 days .'
p11887
aS'i have asked the income tax department to move to a system where not only returns but also scrutiny is done without having to go to the office .'
p11888
aS'queries could be raised and answered online or by email .'
p11889
aS'there should be a visible electronic trail of what is pending with whom , where , and for how long .'
p11890
aS'this is being piloted in five big cities .'
p11891
aS'i have also instructed that the performance appraisal system , for income tax officers be changed .'
p11892
aS'the appraisal should reflect , whether or not the officers orders and assessments have been upheld on appeal .'
p11893
aS'this will deter corruption and also motivate officers to pass correct orders .'
p11894
aS'when fully implemented , these changes , namely online scrutiny , and changes in performance appraisal have transformative potential .'
p11895
aS'this is a distinguished gathering .'
p11896
aS'you have many interesting and thought provoking sessions ahead .'
p11897
aS'my appeal to all of you , is to think beyond conventional remedies .'
p11898
aS'we should not limit our idea of reforms to a few standard notions .'
p11899
aS'our idea of reforms should be inclusive and broad-based .'
p11900
aS'the goal of reforms is not better headlines in the pink papers , but better lives for our people .'
p11901
aS'i am sure you with your knowledge will come up with even better ideas .'
p11902
aS'i look forward tohearing from you of more reforms to transform which will make life better for the whole of india .'
p11903

p11913
aS'i know that the parliament is not in session .'
p11914
aS'prime minister cameron looks relaxed and relieved .'
p11915
aS'but , i want to remind you , mr prime minister , that you owe me royalty for an election slogan .'
p11916
aS'i know that you are hosting me at the chequers this evening .'
p11917
aS'but , i also know that you will understand if i am fair to both sides of the floor .'
p11918
aS'especially since british mps of indian origin are evenly balanced between the treasury and the opposition benches .'
p11919
aS'so , i also extend my good wishes to the labour .'
p11920
aS'indeed , since these are still early days after the election , my warm congratulationsto the members of the house .'
p11921
aS'and , greetings to the eminent leaders of britain and great friends of india present here today .'
p11922
aS'so much of the modern history of india is linked to this building .'
p11923
aS'so much history looms across our relationship .'
p11924
aS'there are others who have spoken forcefully on the debts and dues of history .'
p11925
aS'i will only say that many freedom fighters of india found their calling in the institutions of britain .'
p11926
aS'and , many makers of modern india , including several of my distinguished predecessors , from jawaharlal nehru to dr.'
p11927
aS'manmohan singh , passed through their doors .'
p11928
aS'there are many things on which it is hard to tell anymore if they are british or indian : the jaguar or the scotland yard , for example .'
p11929
aS'the brooke bond tea or my friend late lord ghulam nuns curry .'
p11930
aS'and , our strongest debates are whether the lords pitch swings unfairly or the wicket at eden gardens cracks too early .'
p11931
aS'and , we love the bhangra rap from london just as you like the english novel from india .'
p11932
aS'on the way to this event , prime minister cameron and i paid homage to mahatma gandhi outside the parliament .'
p11933
aS'i was reminded of a question i was asked on a tour abroad .'
p11934
aS'how is it that the statue of gandhi stands outside the british parliament ?'
p11935
aS'to that question , my answer is : the british are wise enough to recognise his greatness ; indians are generous enough to share him ; we are both fortunate enough to have been touched by his life and mission ; and , we are both smart enough to use thestrengths of our connected histories to power the future of our relationship .'
p11936
aS'so , i stand here today , not as a visiting head of government , given the honour to speak in this temple of democracy .'
p11937
aS'i am here as a representative of a fellow institution and a shared tradition .'
p11938
aS'and , tomorrow , prime minister and i will be at the wembley .'
p11939
aS'even in india , every young footballer wants to bend it like beckham .'
p11940
aS'wembley will be a celebration of one-half-million threads of life that bind us ; one and half million people - proud of their heritage in india ; proud of their home in britain .'
p11941
aS'it will be an expression of joy for all that we share : values , institutions , political system , sports , culture and art .'
p11942
aS'and , it will be a recognition of our vibrant partnerships and a shared future .'
p11943
aS'the united kingdom is the third largest investor in india behind singapore and mauritius .'
p11944
aS'india is the third largest source of foreign direct investment projects in the united kingdom .'
p11945
aS'indians invest more in britain than in the rest of european union combined .'
p11946
aS'it is not because they want to save on interpretation costs , but because they find an environment that is welcoming and familiar .'
p11947
aS'it takes an indian icon , tata , to run a british icon and become your nations largest private sector employer .'
p11948

aS'our armed forces exercise with each other , so that they can stand more strongly for the values we represent .'
p11954
aS'this year alone , we have had three exercises together .'
p11955
aS'and , in the international arena , your support has made it more possible for india to take her rightful place in global institutions and regimes .'
p11956
aS'and , it has helped us both advance our common interests .'
p11957
aS'mr speaker , strong as our partnership is , for a relationship such as ours , we must set higher ambitions .'
p11958
aS'we are two democracies ; two strong economies ; and , two innovative societies .'
p11959
aS'we have the comfort of familiarity and the experience of a long partnership .'
p11960
aS'britains resurgence is impressive .'
p11961
aS'its influence on the future of the global economy remains strong .'
p11962
aS'and , mr speaker , india is new bright spot of hope and opportunity for the world .'
p11963
aS'it is not just the universal judgment of international institutions .'
p11964
aS'it is not just the logic of numbers : a nation of 1.'
p11965
aS'25 billion people with 800 million under the age of 35 years .'
p11966
aS'this optimism comes from the energy and enterprise of our youth ; eager for change and confident of achieving it .'
p11967
aS'it is the result of bold and sustained measures to reform our laws , policies , institutions and processes .'
p11968
aS'we are igniting the engines of our manufacturing sector ; making our farms more productive and more resilient ; making our services more innovative and efficient ; moving with urgency on building global skills for our youth ; creating a revolution in startup enterprises ; and , building the next generation infrastructure that will have a light footprint on the earth .'
p11969
aS'our momentum comes not just from the growth we pursue , but from the transformation that we seek in the quality of life for every citizen .'
p11970
aS'much of india that we dream of still lies ahead of us : housing , power , water and sanitation for all ; bank accounts and insurance for every citizen ; connected and prosperous villages ; and , smart and sustainable cities .'
p11971
aS'these are goals with a definite date , not just a mirage of hope .'
p11972
aS'and , inspired by gandhiji , the change has begun with us the way the government works .'
p11973
aS'there is transparency and accountability in governance .'
p11974
aS'there is boldness and speed in decisions .'
p11975
aS'federalism is no longer the fault line of centre-state relations , but the definition of a new partnership of team india .'
p11976
aS'citizens now have the ease of trust , not the burden of proof and process .'
p11977
aS'businesses find an environment that is open and easy to work in .'
p11978
aS'in a nation connected by cell phones , digital india is transforming the interface between government and people .'
p11979
aS'so , mr speaker , with apologies to poet t .'
p11980
aS's .'
p11981
aS'eliot , we wont let the shadow fall between the idea and reality .'
p11982
aS'if you visit india , you will experience the wind of change .'
p11983
aS'it is reflected in the surge of investments from around the world ; in enhanced stability of our economy ; in 190 million new bank accounts of hope and inclusion ; in the increase in our growth to nearly 7.'
p11984
aS'5 % per year ; and , in the sharp rise in our ranking on ease of doing business .'
p11985
aS'and , the motto of sab ka saath , sab ka vikas , is our vision of a nation , in which every citizen belongs , participates and prospers .'
p11986
aS'it is not just a call for economic inclusion .'
p11987
aS'it is also a celebration of our diversity ; the creed for social harmony ; and , a commitment to individual liberties and rights .'
p11988
aS'this is the timeless ethos of our culture ; this is the basis of our constitution ; and , this will be the foundation of our future .'
p11989
aS'mr speaker , members and friends , the progress of india is the destiny of one-sixth of humanity .'
p11990
aS'and , it will also mean a world more confident of its prosperity ; and , more secure about its future .'
p11991
aS'it is also natural and inevitable that our economic relations will grow by leaps and bounds .'
p11992
aS'we will form unbeatable partnerships , if we combine our unique strengths and the size and scale of opportunities in india .'
p11993
aS'we will see more investment and trade .'
p11994
aS'we will open new doors in the services sector .'
p11995
aS'we will collaborate more here and in india - in defence equipment and technology .'
p11996
aS'we will work together on renewable and nuclear energy .'
p11997
aS'we will explore the mysteries of science and harness the power of technology and innovation .'
p11998
aS'we will realise the opportunities of the digital world .'
p11999
aS'our youth will learn more from - and with - each other .'
p12000
aS'but , a relationship as rich as this , with so much promise as ours , can not be measured only in terms of our mutual prosperity .'
p12001
aS'mr speaker , ours is an age of multiple transitions in the world .'
p12002
aS'we are yet to fully comprehend the future unfolding before us .'
p12003
aS'as in the previous ages , it will be different from the world we know .'
p12004
aS'so , in the uncharted waters of our uncertain times , we must together help steer a steady course for this world in the direction that mirrors the ideals we share .'
p12005
aS'for , in that lies not just the success of our two nations , but also the promise of the world that we desire .'
p12006
aS'we have the strength of our partnership and the membership of the united nations , the commonwealth and the g-20 .'
p12007
aS'we live in a world where instability in a distant region quickly reaches our doorsteps .'
p12008
aS'we see this in the challenges of radicalization and refugees .'
p12009
aS'the fault lines are shifting from the boundaries of nations into the web of our societies and the streets of our cities .'
p12010
aS'and , terrorism and extremism are a global force that are larger than their changing names , groups , territories and targets .'
p12011
aS'the world must speak in one voice and act in unison to combat this challenge of our times .'
p12012
aS'we must adopt a comprehensive convention on international terrorism in the un without delay .'
p12013
aS'there should be no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between nations .'
p12014
aS'there should be a resolve to isolate those who harbour terrorists and willingness to stand with nations that will fight them honestly .'
p12015
aS'and , we need a social movement against extremism in countries where it is mostprevalent and , every effort to delink religion and terrorism .'
p12016
aS'oceans remain vital for our prosperity .'
p12017
aS'now , we have to also secure our cyber and outer space .'
p12018
aS'our interests are aligned across many regions .'
p12019
aS'we have a shared interest in stable , prosperous and integrated south asia , drawn together in a shared march to prosperity .'
p12020
aS'we want an afghanistan that is shaped by the dreams of the great afghan people , not by irrational fears and overreaching ambitions of others .'
p12021
aS'a peaceful , stable indian ocean region is vital for global commerce and prosperity .'
p12022
aS'and , the future of asia pacific region will have profound impact on all of us .'
p12023
aS'we both have huge stakes in west asia and the gulf .'
p12024
aS'and , in africa , where , amidst many challenges , we see so many promising signs of courage , wisdom , leadership and enterprise .'
p12025
aS'india has just held an africa summit , in which all 55 countries , and 42 leaders participated .'
p12026
aS'we must also cooperate to launch a low carbon age for a sustainable future for our planet .'
p12027
aS'this is a global responsibility that we must assume in paris later this month .'
p12028
aS'the world has crafted a beautiful balance of collective action common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities .'
p12029
aS'those who have the means and the know-how must help meet the universal aspiration of humanity for clean energy and a healthy environment .'
p12030
aS'and , when we speak of restraint , we must not only think of curbing fossil fuels , but also moderating our lifestyles .'
p12031
aS'we must all do our part .'
p12032
aS'for india , a target of 175 gw of additional capacity in renewable energy by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity of 33-35 % by 2030 are just two of the steps of a comprehensive strategy .'
p12033
aS'i have also proposed to launch during the cop 21 meeting an international solar alliance to make solar energy an integral part of our lives , even in the most unconnected villages .'
p12034
aS'in britain , you are more likely to use an umbrella against rain than the sun .'
p12035
aS'but , my team defined the membership of the solar alliance in more precise terms : you have to be located within the tropics .'
p12036
aS'and , we are pleased that the united kingdom qualifies !'
p12037
aS'so , we look forward to an innovative britain as a valuable partner in this endeavour .'
p12038
aS'prime minister cameron and i are , indeed , very pleased that cooperation on affordable and accessible clean energy is an important pillar of our relations .'
p12039
aS'mr speaker , this is a huge moment for our two great nations .'
p12040
aS'so , we must seize our opportunities , remove the obstacles to cooperation , instill full confidence in our relations and remain sensitive to each others interests .'
p12041
aS'in doing so , we will transform our strategic partnership , and we will make this relationship count as one of the leading global partnerships .'
p12042
aS'ever so often , in the call of britains most famous bard that we must seize the tide in the affairs of men , the world has sought the inspiration to act .'
p12043
aS'and , so must we .'
p12044
aS'but , in defining the purpose of our partnership , we must turn to a great son of india , whose house in london i shall dedicate to the cause of social justice on saturday .'
p12045
aS'dr.'
p12046
aS'b.'
p12047
aS'r.'
p12048
aS'ambedkar , whose 125th birth anniversary we are celebrating now , was not just an architect of indias constitution and our parliamentary democracy .'
p12049
aS'he also stood for the upliftment of the weak , the oppressed and the excluded .'
p12050
aS'and , he lifted us all to a higher cause in the service of humanity ; to build afuture of justice , equality , opportunity and dignity for all humans ; and , peace among people .'
p12051
aS'that is the cause to which india and the united kingdom have dedicated themselves today .'
p12052
aS'thank you very much , thanks a lot .'

p12057
aS'ladies and gentlemen !'
p12058
aS'it is a great pleasure for me to be with you this evening .'
p12059
aS'i must confess that there has been a delay in my coming to this great country .'
p12060
aS'but , the good news is that myself and his excellency cameron have been in constant touch .'
p12061
aS'we have been meeting frequently at various places and exchanging views .'
p12062
aS'i remember our last meeting in new york where he rightly said that india and uk should work closely on the economic front .'
p12063
aS'friends !'
p12064
aS'uk and india have known each other very well since several centuries .'
p12065
aS'our system of governance is also based largely on the westminster model .'
p12066
aS'- our institutions know to interact with each other ; - our people know to work with each other ; - our businesses know to grow with each other that is the reason that uk is among indias major trading partners .'
p12067
aS'uk is also the third largest foreign investor in india .'
p12068
aS'and i must add- this is not one sided .'
p12069
aS'india has emerged as the third largest source of fdi for uk .'
p12070
aS'however , there is significant potential for india and uk to further strengthen their economic ties .'
p12071
aS'we have to effectively leverage the mutual understanding which is there for each other .'
p12072
aS'we are particularly keen to develop the sectors where uk is strong .'
p12073
aS'we are working hard to create conducive conditions for this engagement .'
p12074
aS'a strong indian community here keeps pushing us for better and better integration with uk .'
p12075
aS'friends !'
p12076
aS'since my government took over , we have been working relentlessly to put the economy on track .'
p12077
aS'particularly , we have worked very aggressively to make india an easy and simple place to do business .'
p12078
aS'we believe that this is necessary for improving the lives of ordinary citizens in india .'
p12079
aS'the results of our hard work are now visible .'
p12080
aS'imf chief has recently said that india is among few bright spots in global economy today .'
p12081
aS'our growth rate in the last year was 7.'
p12082
aS'3 % .'
p12083
aS'the world bank has very recently projected our growth rate at 7.'
p12084
aS'5 % for this fiscal and even better in the coming years .'
p12085
aS'thus , we are fortunate to be sailing in the right direction .'
p12086
aS'in the world bank report of 2016 on ease of doing business , india has moved up by 12 ranks at one go .'
p12087
aS'no other country has made such a big improvement .'
p12088
aS'we are also committed to take these corrections at the state , district and city level .'
p12089
aS'states are moving hand-in-hand with the federal government in this task in the spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism .'
p12090
aS'recently , we did a ranking of our state governments on ease of doing business with the help of the world bank group .'
p12091
aS'this has prompted the state governments into a healthy competition among themselves to ensure a business friendly eco-system .'
p12092
aS'this was for the first time that the world bank involved itself in a sub-national exercise on ease of doing business .'
p12093
aS'friends !'
p12094
aS'one of the biggest challenges in india today is to productively employ the youth .'
p12095
aS'for meeting this challenge , we need to provide a huge push to manufacturing which has stagnated at around 16 % of the gdp for several decades .'
p12096
aS'this share must reach around 25 % in the short and medium term .'
p12097
aS'with this in view , we have launched the make in india initiative .'
p12098
aS'we are working on all fronts to make india a global manufacturing hub .'
p12099
aS'to achieve this objective , apart from vigorous exercise for ease of doing business , we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure .'
p12100
aS'the hall mark of our strategy now is policy driven governance .'
p12101
aS'measures like transparent auction and allocation of key natural resources like coal , spectrum , iron ore have created a level playing field for investors .'
p12102
aS'to enhance the flow of foreign investments , we have liberalized the fdi regime allowing 100 % fdi in railways .'
p12103
aS'we enhanced the fdi limits to 49 % in defence and insurance .'
p12104
aS'we are also conscious of the last mile operational issues in such policies .'
p12105
aS'in that spirit , early this week , we have carried out substantial changes in the fdi regime across 15 sectors .'
p12106
aS'to give an example : now there are just no restrictions in the fdi policy for construction sector .'
p12107
aS'similarly , very radical liberalization has been done in sectors like plantation , e-commerce and single brand retail .'
p12108
aS'moreover , we have now brought most of the fdi proposals under the automatic route .'
p12109
aS'with this round of reforms , i can say that india is among the most open countries for foreign investments .'
p12110
aS'infrastructure is another big challenge for india .'
p12111
aS'we are keen to build futuristic physical and social infrastructure .'
p12112
aS'through self-imposed discipline in financial management , we have been able to allocate more resources for infrastructure sectors .'
p12113
aS'in addition , we are setting up an india investment and infrastructure fund .'
p12114
aS'we have targeted an annual contribution of 3.'
p12115
aS'5 billion us dollars into this fund from our own resources .'
p12116
aS'we are putting in place a professional team for assetmanagement .'
p12117
aS'we have also come up with the mechanism of tax free infrastructure bonds for projects in rail , road and other sectors .'
p12118
aS'we will work together with the british government , industry and the financial markets to deepen our relationship and harness their interest in indias infrastructure .'
p12119
aS'very soon , these bonds will become strong instruments for engagement between our financial markets .'
p12120
aS'friends !'
p12121
aS'there were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on the sentiments of foreign investors .'
p12122
aS'we have taken very decisive steps to remove a number of long pending concerns .'
p12123
aS'to give you some examples : - we have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance ; - we have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years previously ; - we have taken almost 60 % of the defence items out of the licensing process and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate for the exports - we have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and demonstrated this position in a number of ways - this includes not going for imposition of minimum alternate tax on fpis ; - we have introduced the concept of composite sector caps for the fpis and other foreign investors .'
p12124
aS'- we have notified the regulations for the alternative investment funds ; - we have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for real estate investment trusts - we have modified the permanent establishment norms ; - we have also decided to defer the implementation of the general anti-avoidance rules for two years ; - we have introduced the gst bill in parliament ; we are hopeful to roll it out in 2016 ; - we are working on a new bankruptcy code ; the company law tribunal is soon going to be formed .'
p12125
aS'friends !'
p12126
aS'we want to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable .'
p12127
aS'we are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters .'
p12128
aS'as a result of our initiatives , - the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive .'
p12129
aS'- fdi inflows have gone up by 40 % compared with previous years corresponding period .'
p12130
aS'- india has been recently ranked as the most attractive investment destinations by ernst & young- in a ranking of the top greenfield investment destinations in the first half of 2015 , india is at number one .'
p12131
aS'- foreign policy magazine of usa has ranked india as number one fdi destination .'
p12132
aS'- in a study of 100 countries on growth , innovation and leadership , india has been ranked no.'
p12133
aS'1 by frost & sullivan .'
p12134
aS'- india has improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness from 15th to 9th .'
p12135
aS'- india has also jumped 16 places on the world economic forums global competitive index .'
p12136
aS'- moodys have upgraded the rating of india as positive .'
p12137
aS'thus , just in eighteen months , we have successfully restored the credibility of india in the eyes of global players .'
p12138
aS'through ppp , we are encouraging private investments in areas where earlier only government used to invest .'
p12139
aS'we are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises , to instill market discipline .'
p12140
aS'we are keen to learn from your experience in structuring and implementing ppp projects .'
p12141
aS'i am personally convinced and want to assure you that india is committed to protect intellectual property rights of all innovators and entrepreneurs .'
p12142
aS'we have taken several initiatives for transparency and online processing in ip administration .'
p12143
aS'a comprehensive national ipr policy is being finalized .'
p12144
aS'friends !'
p12145
aS'we want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality .'
p12146
aS'our commitment and aggressiveness to achieve the goal in a faster and effective manner offers immense opportunities to british companies .'
p12147
aS'these opportunities range from building 50 million houses to setting up 100 smart cities ; modernization of railway network and re-development of stations to new railway corridors ; generation of 175 gw of renewable energy to transmission and distributionnetworks , from national highways and bridges , to metro rail networks .'
p12148

p12230
aS'each brics member country should take the lead in at least two priority areas listed in the strategy .'
p12231
aS'it would be appropriate if the first joint meeting is held during the russian chairmanship .'
p12232
aS'the joint sitting may also work on a roadmap for trade , economic and investment cooperation till 2020 .'
p12233
aS'excellencies , we hope that the new development bank will start its operations quickly .'
p12234
aS'as i said in ufa , its first project should be on clean energy , preferably across all brics countries .'
p12235
aS'we need to create a supporting mechanism , such as a new development bank institute or ndbi , which should function as bank of ideas , a storehouse of experience and a knowledge powerhouse .'
p12236
aS'it can also provide inputs for the contingency reserve arrangements .'

p12275
aS'this includes additional capacity of 175 gw of renewable energy by 2022 ; cut in subsidies on fossil fuel and tax on coal ; and , national clean energy fund of us $ 3 billion to promote clean technologies .'
p12276
aS'with our highly ambitious/intended nationally determined contributions ( indcs ) , india would remain in step with the world .'
p12277
aS'we look forward to a concrete outcome in paris within the framework of the un convention on climate change .'
p12278
aS'the framework has an appropriate balance of collective action : equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities .'
p12279
aS'at g 20 , we can play an effective role in supporting the multilateral goals of increasing research and development to develop affordable renewable energy .'
p12280
aS'we should also ensure that finance and technology is available to meet the universal global aspiration for clean energy .'
p12281
aS'we must meet the target of us $ 100 billion goal per year by 2020 .'
p12282
aS'g20 countries should increase the share of traffic on public transportation in cities by 30 % by 2030 .'

p12287
aS'we are still short in our efforts to fulfill our last years commitment to raise our collective gdp by an additional 2 % by 2018.'
p12288
aS'i propose that we consider how g20 can build support systems that focus on countries with maximum growth potential , help address specific bottlenecks there and facilitate implementation of country strategies .'
p12289
aS'g20 must continue to focus on infrastructure , as we did in brisbane in 2014 .'

p12299
aS'i congratulate the turkish presidency for coordinating efforts on growth and investment strategies and employment plans .'
p12300
aS'we must all now implement our commitments .'
p12301
aS'to stimulate growth , we need to enhance public investments , not just rely on monetary policy .'
p12302
aS'g20s continued call to central banks for careful communication on monetary policy actions will be helpful in keeping financial and currency markets stable .'
p12303
aS'multilateral development banks should enlarge their capital base to support infrastructure needs of the developing countries .'
p12304
aS'new institutions such as the new development bank are welcome additional sources of financing .'
p12305
aS'there is global consensus on the need to address climate change .'
p12306
aS'however , multilateral institutions should not impose such difficult safeguards and conditions on loans that they become barriers to development in many countries and undermine sustainable development .'
p12307
aS'g20 efforts must be aligned with the un sustainable development goals , adopted this year , particularly with the number one goal of elimination of all poverty by 2030 .'
p12308
aS'we welcome the g20 focus on employment of women and , on youth this year .'
p12309
aS'stable long term global economic growth requires not just capital flows , but also efforts to facilitate labour mobility and skill portability .'

aS'i am happy to be here today to address the delegates of the sixth global focal point conference on asset recovery , and the annual conference of cbi and state anti-corruption bureaus .'
p12319
aS'i also extend a warm welcome to the delegates from abroad who are attending this conference .'
p12320
aS'i hope that your visit to india is pleasant and memorable .'
p12321
aS'i also congratulate the officers of cbi who have received medals for distinguished service today .'
p12322
aS'ladies and gentlemen , governments across the world work to transform the lives of the poor and the marginalized .'
p12323
aS'corruption is one of the principal challenges to that objective .'
p12324
aS'we in india are currently in a crucial phase of nation building .'
p12325
aS'our mission is to build a prosperous india .'
p12326
aS'an india where - our farmers are capable ; - our workers satisfied ; - our women empowered ; - and our youth self-reliant ; this is not an impossible mission .'
p12327
aS'however , to achieve this objective , it is essential to fight relentlessly against corruption .'
p12328
aS'india stands committed in its fight against corruption .'
p12329
aS'my government has taken significant steps to check corruption and the menace of black money in a short span of time .'
p12330
aS'the very day that we assumed office , we constituted a special investigation team under the supervision of the supreme court to look into the issue .'
p12331
aS'we have entered into agreements with many countries for exchanging real time information on black money .'
p12332
aS'the government has signed the inter government agreement with the united states to implement the foreign accounttax compliance act .'
p12333
aS'this agreement enables indian tax authorities to receive financial account information of indians from foreign countries on an automatic basis .'
p12334
aS'a comprehensive and deterrent law , the black money undisclosed foreign income and assets and imposition of tax act has been enacted .'
p12335
aS'it provides for stringent penalties and prosecution .'
p12336
aS'we have also introduced a provision under the prevention of money laundering act for restitution of assets .'
p12337
aS'this will enable millions of poor investors who have lost money in ponzi schemes to recover a part of their hard earned money .'
p12338
aS'i hope that the partnership between stolen asset recovery initiative ( star ) and interpol will help in confiscation and recovery of stolen assets .'
p12339
aS'i am sure that this conference will go a long way towards elimination of safe havens for the proceeds of corruption and help build secure exchange platforms for recovery of criminal assets .'
p12340
aS'our recent initiatives to curb systemic corruption such as auction of coal blocks and fm radio spectrum have eliminated the element of discretion in allocation of national resources .'
p12341
aS'this has brought about transparency in the system and restored faith of the citizens in government .'
p12342
aS'it has also generated substantial revenues for the government which will benefit our people .'
p12343
aS'ladies and gentlemen , we are focused on providing system based and policy driven governance .'
p12344
aS'a governance structure that is sensitive , transparent and accountable .'
p12345
aS'let me share an example to illustrate how corruption can be eliminated silently and efficiently by simple technology and policy based initiatives .'
p12346
aS'when we assumed office , i was informed that cooking gas cylinders were being subsidized to the tune of approximately four hundred rupees per cylinder .'
p12347
aS'this subsidy was being provided to rich and poor alike .'
p12348
aS'we decided that the subsidy should be credited directly into bank accounts of consumers with each account being linked to a unique aadhaar card .'
p12349
aS'this single intervention has reduced the number of registered consumers claiming gas subsidy by about fifty million .'
p12350
aS"subsequently , wealso launched a campaign for the  well off '' to voluntarily give up cooking gas subsidy ."
p12351
aS'the response has been very encouraging .'
p12352
aS'as on date , more than 4.'
p12353
aS'5 million people have given up their gas subsidy .'
p12354
aS'friends .'
p12355
aS'one of the challenges that we must address is governance deficit .'
p12356
aS'this includes : - inadequate capacity to deliver public services effectively and efficiently - lack of appropriate policy responses to emerging situations- and delays in project implementation my government has taken several steps to make the bureaucracy more efficient performance-oriented and accountable .'
p12357
aS'the government is committed to ensuring probity among public servants and to protect them from frivolous allegations .'
p12358
aS'equally , the government is unsparing when it comes to punishing the corrupt .'
p12359
aS'we have so far removed and ensured pension cuts of 45 senior officers of various services for unsatisfactory performance and delivery in public service .'
p12360
aS'ladies and gentlemen , globalization of organized crime poses a major threat to economies throughout the world .'
p12361
aS'it is a well-known fact that dirty money drives out good money .'
p12362
aS'organized crime can hamper investment and economic growth .'
p12363
aS'it can also infiltrate or acquire control of large sectors of the economy .'
p12364
aS'illicit funding promotes organized criminal activities like drug trafficking , arms trafficking , human trafficking , and terrorism .'
p12365
aS'the dastardly acts committed in paris a few days ago are a grim reminder that terrorists have shown remarkable flexibility and adaptability in meeting their funding requirements .'
p12366
aS'they derive funding from a variety of criminal activities which include smuggling of narcotics , bank robbery , vehicle theft , fake currency , or from state sponsors and activities in failed states .'
p12367
aS'disrupting fund flows constrains the capabilities of terrorists and reduces their ability to execute attacks .'
p12368
aS'this involves putting in place both systemic safeguards , and targeted economic sanctions based on credible counter-terrorism intelligence .'
p12369
aS'targeting proceeds of crime is an important element in this fight against crime .'
p12370
aS'hence , there is an imperative need to focus our efforts to enhance international cooperation in the field of asset recovery for fighting crime , corruption and terrorism .'
p12371
aS'confiscation of property of offenders not only serves as punishment but also discourages commission of crime .'
p12372
aS'in fact , kautilya in his artha shastra , had suggested confiscation of illegitimate income as one of the punishments for corrupt public servants .'
p12373
aS'i am also pleased to note that the heads of state anti-corruption bureaus and cbi will deliberate on the related theme of tracking proceeds of corruption .'
p12374
aS'this two decade old forum must not only focus on prosecution of offenders involved in corruption but also modify their standard operating procedures to more effectively target the proceeds of corruption .'
p12375
aS'ladies and gentlemen , economic liberalism and globalization have drastically increased the ability to park profits of crime anywhere in the world .'
p12376
aS'today proceeds of crime can be routed through dozens of countries within seconds .'
p12377
aS'by a process of layering the money-trail can be concealed .'
p12378
aS'investigation agencies are limited by national boundaries .'
p12379
aS'our government is committed to the implementation of a uniform global standard on automatic exchange of information , on a fully reciprocal basis .'
p12380
aS'this willfacilitate exchange of information regarding persons who have concealed their money in offshore financial centres and tax havens .'
p12381
aS'interpol is playing an increasingly active role in asset recovery .'
p12382
aS'since 2009 , global focal point forum is actively promoting the exchange of corruption data among law enforcement agencies and anti-corruption entities worldwide .'
p12383
aS'in this context mention must be made of interpols initiatives such as i-secom , a secure web-based encrypted channel for the exchange of sensitive data among the specialized anti-corruption community .'
p12384
aS'the new interpol notice could add value toasset-tracing investigations and facilitate real time information sharing in complex cases .'
p12385
aS'i appreciate the efforts of interpol and its partners - world bank and unodc - in conceiving the idea and giving leadership to this forum that has the potential to put an end to safe havens for the corrupt .'
p12386
aS'i am told that the excellent and proactive cooperation between interpol and indian investigative agencies has resulted in tracking of many fugitive criminals and their subsequent deportation or extradition .'
p12387
aS'i would like this cooperation to deepen .'
p12388
aS'cbi has been effectively assisting the indian law enforcement agencies and their foreign counterparts in overcoming the barriers that complicate the exchange of investigative information .'
p12389
aS'i am also informed that cbi has been makinguse of interpol tools and databases for securing greater cooperation among law enforcement organizations throughout the world .'
p12390
aS'it has also been consistently partnering interpol capacity building programmes .'
p12391
aS'we are in the process of establishing an international centre of excellence in investigation at ghaziabad .'
p12392
aS'this centre will render world class certified courses on investigation and prosecution in specialized and emerging domains of crime including cybercrime , to the law enforcement community of india and abroad .'
p12393
aS'a centralized technology vertical to focus on combating new age crimes like cybercrime , is also being planned .'
p12394
aS'there are several cases in the annals of indian judicial history in which conviction was secured solely on the basis of forensic expert opinion .'
p12395
aS'india must , therefore , have adequate facilities to be able to clear the huge backlog of forensic opinion .'
p12396
aS'the proceeds of crime and corruption are stolen assets .'
p12397
aS'they do not belong to the country where they are stashed .'
p12398
aS'they rightfully belong to the citizens of the country from which they have been plundered .'
p12399
aS'i am well aware of the legal and procedural obstacles and differences in evidentiary standards that hinder asset recovery .'
p12400
aS'to overcome these challenges , police and law enforcement agencies should forge formal and informal relationships .'
p12401
aS'i hope thisconference provides all of you such an opportunity .'
p12402
aS'i also hope that the delegates will seriously deliberate and devise proper procedures and protocols to quicken the process of tracing , identifying , restraining , confiscating , and repatriating the stolen assets .'

aS'i feel honoured to address this privileged gathering of the leaders who have transformed south east asia into one of the most dynamic regions of the world .'
p12409
aS'i congratulate you for this achievement .'
p12410
aS'i also congratulate you on the creation of one asean community which you are going to sign off tomorrow .'
p12411
aS'india and asean are natural partners .'
p12412
aS'our ties date back to ancient times .'
p12413
aS'they continue to serve as a bridge between our countries and regions .'
p12414
aS'friends !'
p12415
aS'i have been saying that the 21st century belongs to asia .'
p12416
aS'i say this because of the track record of the asean countries .'
p12417
aS'together , aseans ten member countries form an economic powerhouse .'
p12418
aS'asean has emerged as one of the largest economic zones in the world .'
p12419
aS'last fifteen years have seen your rapid and yet stable growth .'
p12420
aS'your macro-economic stability has been the main reason for growth and stability in south east asia .'
p12421
aS'with good governance , futuristic infrastructure and focuson new age technologies , you have created excellence .'
p12422
aS'in simple things like tourism , you have done miracles .'
p12423
aS'once again , i compliment the leadership and people of asean countries for what they have achieved .'
p12424
aS'when i analyse the asian miracle , i find that small countries of asean and a big country like china , both have done well .'
p12425
aS'this shows that growth depends more on the spirit of people rather than the size of population .'
p12426
aS'i have had personal relations with many leaders of this region .'
p12427
aS'i have also visited a number of places a number of times .'
p12428
aS'even as prime minister , my engagements with the asian leadership started as soon as i took over .'
p12429
aS'i met a number of asean leaders in the last summittoo .'
p12430
aS'my government took office nearly 18 months ago .'
p12431
aS'the indian economy faced serious challenges .'
p12432
aS'a high fiscal deficit , a high current account deficit , a large number of stalled infrastructure projects and persistent inflation were among them .'
p12433
aS'it was obvious that reforms were needed .'
p12434
aS'we asked ourselves the question reforms for what ?'
p12435
aS'what is the aim of reform ?'
p12436
aS'is it just to increase the measured rate of gdp growth ?'
p12437
aS'or is it to bring about a transformation in society ?'
p12438
aS'my answer is clear : we must reform to transform .'
p12439
aS'in short , reform is not an end in itself .'
p12440
aS'reform for me is just a way station on the long journey to the destination .'
p12441
aS'the destination is the transformation of india .'
p12442
aS'we have to take the fruits of development to the margins of our geography and to the bottom of our demography .'
p12443
aS'we have to touch lives , while reaching for the sky .'
p12444
aS'by almost every major economic indicator , india is doing better than when we took office 18 months ago .'
p12445
aS'- gdp growth is up and inflation is down- foreign investment is up and the current account deficit is down .'
p12446
aS'- tax revenues are up and interest rates are down .'
p12447
aS'- the fiscal deficit is down and the rupee is stable .'
p12448
aS'obviously , this did not happen by accident .'
p12449
aS'and the world economy is not exactly doing well .'
p12450
aS'this success is the result of a series of concerted policies .'
p12451
aS'we have embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation .'
p12452
aS'we have entered , for the first time , into a monetary framework agreement with the reserve bank to curb inflation .'
p12453
aS'even while cutting the fiscal deficit , we have substantially increased productive public investment .'
p12454
aS'this has been made possible in two ways .'
p12455
aS'firstly , we have imposed carbon taxes on fossil fuels .'
p12456
aS'we have taken the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies , and have in fact imposed taxes on fossil fuels .'
p12457
aS'we have increased the cess on coal by 300 % .'
p12458
aS'globally , there is much talk of carbon taxes .'
p12459
aS'we have actually acted .'
p12460
aS'secondly , we havereduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods including targeting subsidies to the deserving through technology .'
p12461
aS'overall , there is increased confidence within and outside the country .'
p12462
aS'the imf and world bank have expressed even better hope for our economy this year and after .'
p12463
aS'the economist magazine this week stated that india is in healthier shape than any other big emerging economy .'
p12464
aS'however , as i said , our aim is not mere reform , but reform to transform .'
p12465
aS'macro-economic stability is good .'
p12466
aS'but to transform india , much more needs to be done .'
p12467
aS'we have begun a series of concerted steps .'
p12468
aS'these include structural and institutional reforms .'
p12469
aS'agriculture remains indias mainstay in terms of providing livelihood .'
p12470
aS'we have introduced a series of simple but powerful structural reforms .'
p12471
aS'there was a tendency to divert subsidised fertiliser for the production of chemicals .'
p12472
aS'we have found a simple but very effective solution : by neem-coating the fertiliser , it becomes unsuitable for diversion .'
p12473
aS'we are now moving towards universal neem-coating .'
p12474
aS'this has already saved billions of rupees of diverted farm subsidies .'
p12475
aS'we have also introduced soil health card .'
p12476
aS'this tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil and then enables him to choose the right crop , best quantity and mix of inputs .'
p12477
aS'we have launched a housing for all program , one of the most ambitious in the world .'
p12478
aS'it involves building 20 million urban houses and 29.'
p12479
aS'5 million rural houses , totalling nearly 50 million .'
p12480
aS'while the programme will make sure no indian is houseless , it will also generate a large amount of employment - that too , mainly for the unskilled , the semi-skilled and the poor .'
p12481
aS'we have undertaken major improvements in the transport sector .'
p12482
aS'our major ports witnessed a 4.'
p12483
aS'65 % growth in traffic and an 11.'
p12484
aS'2 % increase in operating income , in 2014-15 despite a global contraction in trade volume .'
p12485
aS'the pace of award of new highway works has increased from 9 km/day in 2013-14 to 23 km/day currently .'
p12486
aS'these will have large multiplier effects throughout the economy .'
p12487
aS'we were committed to restore credibility in the process of allocation of natural resources .'
p12488
aS'my government has intervened with legislative and administrative measures to improve the supply of critical inputs and raw materials .'
p12489
aS'they include coal , other minerals and spectrum .'
p12490
aS'the hallmark of this intervention is allocation through transparent auction .'
p12491
aS'we started the jan dhan yojana .'
p12492
aS'in less than a year , we opened 190 million new bank accounts .'
p12493
aS'on social security front , we have launched innovative and attractive schemes for insurance and pension .'
p12494
aS'we have also set up mudra bank to fund the small traders who were unfunded so far .'
p12495
aS'more than six million small traders have already availed the loans .'
p12496
aS'while expanding the banking services , we are also taking steps to strengthen the banking system .'
p12497
aS'credible and capable bankers have been appointed to head banks .'
p12498
aS'for the first time since banks were nationalised 46 years ago , private sector professionals have been appointed in key positions .'
p12499
aS'we have taken concerted action to revive stalled infrastructure projects we have started a major revamp of the power sector .'
p12500
aS'these measures will also benefit our banks .'
p12501
aS'let me now turn to issues of investment , which may be of more direct relevance to you .'
p12502
aS'in a break with over 65 years of tradition , we have involved indias states in foreign policy .'
p12503
aS'the ministry of external affairs has been asked to work with the states .'
p12504
aS'when i visited china , a state-to-state summit was also held .'
p12505
aS'and states have been asked to create export promotion councils .'
p12506
aS'making the states think globally is yet another reform with potential to transform .'
p12507
aS'our aim is to create jobs for more than a billion young hands .'
p12508
aS'to provide this , the share of manufacturing must reach around 25 % in our gdp .'
p12509
aS'we have launched a campaign called make in india and aggressively worked on the front of ease of doing business .'
p12510
aS'reducing complicated procedures , making them available at one platform- preferably online , simplifying the forms and formats has been taken up on war footing .'
p12511
aS'that is how we have jumped up by 12 ranks in the world banks ease of doingbusiness report of 2016 .'
p12512
aS'industry is realizing the benefits of these changes .'
p12513
aS'index of industrial production in the current year shows a distinct improvement over the previous year .'
p12514
aS'we are working in all ways to make india a global manufacturing hub .'
p12515
aS'world class infrastructure has remained a dream for india .'
p12516
aS'hence , our maximum focus is on building futuristic infrastructure .'
p12517
aS'by exercising tight control over unproductive expenditure , we have greatly increased capital investment by the public sector .'
p12518
aS'to further augment such investments , we are encouraging the ppp model .'
p12519
aS'we are also setting up national investment and infrastructure fund which will help us leverage public investments .'
p12520
aS'we are also coming up with tax freeinfrastructure bonds with a view to broaden the corporate bond market and to provide long term finance for infrastructure .'
p12521
aS'we are eager to work with malaysia , singapore and other asean countries in this regard .'
p12522
aS'as a result of our initiatives , - the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive .'
p12523
aS'foreign investment is up 40 % .'
p12524
aS'- india has been consistently ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions .'
p12525
aS'- india has also improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness .'
p12526
aS'against 15th so far , now we are at 9th place .'
p12527
aS'- india has also jumped 16 places on the world economic forums global competitive index after five years of decline in the list .'
p12528
aS'- moodys have upgraded the outlook for india .'
p12529
aS'campaigns like digital india and skill india are designed to prepare the people to take part in this process .'
p12530
aS'we have witnessed exponential growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past .'
p12531
aS'to tap this energy fully , we have launched the start up india campaign .'
p12532
aS'we are aware of the interest of the global investor community in the potential that india has .'
p12533
aS'in recent months , this interest has gone up .'
p12534
aS'therefore , to re-vitalize the flow of investments , we have launched the second wave of structural and financial reforms .'
p12535
aS'we are trying to further open up the economy and introduce an element of predictability and stability in taxation system .'
p12536
aS'to give you some examples : - we have allowed and enhanced fdi levels in key sectors including insurance , defence and railways .'
p12537
aS'- now , most of these fdi sectors have been put on automatic approval route .'
p12538
aS'- we have also rationalised fdi policies in many sectors , including construction , plantation and medical devices .'
p12539
aS'- we have now allowed composite caps for foreign portfolio investors in all sectors where fdi is allowed .'
p12540
aS'earlier , portfolio investments had a separate cap .'
p12541
aS'- we have greatly liberalised the licensing regime ; to give you one example - we have taken out almost 60 % of defence items out of the licensing process .'
p12542
aS'- we have ended retrospective taxation .'

aS'- we have introduced the goods & services tax bill in parliament .'
p12547

aS'this will create a unified system of taxation across the country .'
p12549
aS'- we have drafted a new bankruptcy code .'
p12550
aS'formation of the company law tribunal to expedite cases is on the way .'
p12551
aS'these are just a few examples .'
p12552
aS'almost on a daily basis , we are trying to remove the bottlenecks that were affecting our growth process .'
p12553
aS'even early this month , we have taken very dynamic steps to further open up the economy for fdi .'
p12554
aS'with this round of reforms , we are among the most open economies in the world .'
p12555
aS'going further , i want to assure you that india is committed to protect intellectual property rights of all innovators .'
p12556
aS'we have taken several initiatives for transparency and online processing in ip administration .'
p12557
aS'a comprehensive national ipr policy is expected by the end of the year .'
p12558
aS'we are moving fast to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable .'
p12559

p12563
aS'the requirement of road , rail and waterways is enormous .'

p12565
aS'we have to do all this in a short span of time .'
p12566
aS'our democratic values and an alert judicial system ensure the safety of your investments .'
p12567
aS'we have set the tone of governancewith a long term vision and an open mind .'
p12568
aS'we are particularly working to make india the easiest place to do business .'
p12569

p12570
aS'now , it is indias turn .'

p12670
aS'the barbaric terrorist strikes in paris , ankara , beirut , mali and on the russian aircraft is a stark reminder that its shadow stretches across our societies and our world , both in recruitment and choice of targets .'

aS'excellencies , since my government entered office 18 months ago , no region has seen greater engagement from india than the asia pacific and the indian ocean region .'

aS'there are always challenges , but there are also dreams .'

aS'and each succeeding generation has been defined more by their successes than by their challenges .'
p12976
aS'so i ask you to continue to pursue your dreams for yourself , for malaysia and for our two great nations .'
p12977
aS'i want to leave with you the words of a great son of india , a great symbol of humanity , who also came from the shores of tamil nadu .'
p12978
aS'the late former president apj abdul kalam , one of the makers of modern india , came here in 2008 .'
p12979
aS'he wanted to be here again with you , but god had other plans .'
p12980
aS'but , his life , his message and his dreams remain forever a source of inspiration .'
p12981
aS'he said :  my message specially to the young people is to have courage to think differently , courage to invent , to travel the unexplored path , courage to discover the impossible , and to conquer the problems and succeed .'
p12982

aS'i congratulate you on the outstanding summits , and for the establishment of the asean community .'
p12990
aS'your review of the eas on its tenth anniversary set an excellent course for this regions most important forum .'

aS'the malaysian-indian community forms a very special and strong bond between us .'

aS'we have built a vibrant economic partnership .'
p13002
aS'we are located on the same maritime route .'

aS'i am particularly grateful to you for our security cooperation .'
p13007
aS'it underlines our shared commitment to deal with our security challenges .'
p13008
aS'we will continue to deepen our cooperation in this area .'
p13009
aS'the recent spate of attacks in different countries , not to mention the ceaseless terrorist attempts against india and afghanistan , are a reminder of the global nature of this threat .'
p13010
aS'mr .'
p13011
aS'prime minister , you have provided leadership in combating extremism and radicalization , rejecting any link between terrorism and religion , and in highlighting the real values of islam .'
p13012
aS'this is a great contribution to an important aspect of our global efforts against this challenge .'
p13013
aS'we will also make our defence cooperation stronger , including for advancing maritime security and strengthening disaster response in our region .'
p13014
aS'i am pleased that we have agreed to upgrade our joint exercises and set up the su-30 forum .'
p13015
aS'we will do more in terms of level and complexity of exercises and collaboration in training and defence equipment .'
p13016
aS'our agreement to cooperate in cyber security is very important .'
p13017
aS'as our lives get more networked , this is emerging as one of the most serious concerns of our age .'
p13018
aS'i share prime ministers belief that our trade and investment relations can be scaled up significantly .'
p13019
aS'we intend to exploit the full potential of our bilateral agreements and the india-asean agreements .'
p13020
aS'we look forward to an early conclusion of the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement .'
p13021
aS'malaysian competence in infrastructure is well known .'
p13022
aS'malaysia has completed several important projects , including in the road sector , in india .'
p13023
aS'i expressed our desire to see enhanced malaysian participation in areas such as expansion and upgrading of infrastructure , make in india , and smart cities projects .'
p13024
aS'indian companies have a strong presence in malaysia .'
p13025
aS'ircon is contributing to development of rail infrastructure here .'
p13026
aS'we want to raise the level of indian presence in the malaysian economy .'
p13027
aS'prime minister and i are determined to explore steps to show concrete and early results .'
p13028
aS'i am also meeting malaysian ceos later today .'
p13029
aS'i am happy that we are strengthening our excellent cooperation in public administration and governance .'
p13030
aS'i have personally interacted with pemandu , and am pleased that our niti ayog will work with them .'
p13031
aS'we will place special emphasis on cultural and people-to-people ties .'
p13032
aS'as you know , prime minister najib and i will inaugurate the torana gate at the entrance of little india in bricksfield .'
p13033
aS'this is a gift of india , but a labour of love for prime minister najib .'
p13034
aS'and , it will be a symbol of our timeless ties and the friendship between our people .'
p13035
aS'we invite malaysian students to study in india and urge early conclusion of an agreement on mutual recognition of degrees .'

p13042
aa(lp13043
S'excellency , prime minister lee hsien loongexcellency , deputy prime minister tharman shanmugaratnamhonourable ministers , professor tan tai yong , distinguished guests , thank you for the honour and privilege of delivering the singapore lecture .'
p13044
aS'i am conscious that i walk in the footsteps of leaders who have shaped modern india and our relationship with this region president shri apj abdul kalam , prime minister shri p .'
p13045

p13046
aS'narsimha rao , and former prime minister shri atal bihari vajpayee .'
p13047
aS'mr .'
p13048
aS'prime minister , i am deeply honoured that you have joined us here .'
p13049
aS'we have been on the road together in the past few weeks for the g20 and the asean and east asia summits .'
p13050
aS'this tells you how deeply linked the destinies of our two nations are .'
p13051
aS'to the people of singapore , on 50 years of independence , i extend the greetings and the good wishes of 1.'
p13052
aS'25 billion friends and admirers .'
p13053
aS'in the life of humans and nations , milestones of time are natural .'
p13054
aS'but , few countries can celebrate the first fifty years of existence with a sense of pride and satisfaction that singapore deserves to .'
p13055
aS'and , i can do no better than to begin with homage to one of the tallest leaders of our time and the architect of modern singapore lee kuan yew .'
p13056
aS'to capture his mission in own words , he gave his life to see a successful singapore .'
p13057
aS'and , it was with his well known steely determination that he saw singapore through to its golden jubilee year .'
p13058
aS'his impact was global .'
p13059
aS'and , in him , india had a well wisher , who spoke with the honesty of true friendship .'
p13060
aS'he believed in indias potential at home and her role abroad more than many in india .'
p13061
aS'for me , he was a personal inspiration .'
p13062
aS'from his singapore stories , i drew many lessons .'
p13063
aS'the most profound , yet simple , idea was that transformation of a nation begins with a change in the way we are .'
p13064
aS'and , that it was as important to keep your city and surroundings clean as it was to build modern infrastructure .'
p13065
aS'for me , too , in india , the swachh bharat campaign , is not just a programme to clean our environment , but to transform the way we think , live and work .'
p13066
aS'for quality , efficiency , and productivity are not just technical measures , but also a state of mind and a way of life .'
p13067
aS'so , in my visit to singapore this march and in the observance of a days mourning in india , we wanted to honour a true friend and a very special relationship .'
p13068
aS'singapore is a nation that has become a metaphor for the reality of dreams .'
p13069
aS'singapore teaches us many things .'
p13070
aS'the size of a nation is no barrier to the scale of its achievements .'
p13071
aS'and , the lack of resources is no constraint for inspiration , imagination , and innovation .'
p13072
aS'when a nation embraces diversity , it can unite behind a common purpose .'
p13073
aS'and , international leadership flows from the power of thought , not just from the orthodox measures of strength .'
p13074
aS'singapore has done more than just lift a nation into the highest levels of prosperity within a generation .'
p13075
aS'it has inspired this regions progress and led in its integration .'
p13076
aS'and , it has made others believe that the possibility of progress is within our horizons , not an unseen and distant hope .'
p13077
aS'singapores success flows not from the aggregate of numbers and the size of investments .'
p13078
aS'it is based on what i believe is the key to success : the quality of human resources , the belief of a people and the resolve of a nation .'
p13079
aS'distinguished members of the audience , it is with the same vision that we are pursuing the transformation of india .'
p13080
aS'people are the purpose of our efforts ; and , they will be the power behind change .'
p13081
aS'i do not judge the success of our efforts from the cold statistics of number , but from the warm glow of smile on human faces .'
p13082
aS'so , one set of our policies are to empower our people .'
p13083
aS'the other set to create the conditions in which enterprise flourishes , opportunities expand and the potential of our citizens are unlocked .'
p13084
aS'so , we are investing in our people through skills and education ; special focus on the girl child ; financial inclusion ; sustainable habitats ; clean rivers and smart cities ; and , access to basic needs of all our citizens from water and sanitation to power and housing .'
p13085
aS'we will nurture and defend an environment in which every citizen belongs and participates , secure of her rights and confident about her opportunities .'
p13086
aS'and , we are creating opportunities by reforming our laws , regulations , policies , processes and institutions ; by the way we govern ourselves ; and the way we work with state governments .'
p13087
aS'together with this software of change , we are also building the hardware of progress next generation infrastructure , revived manufacturing , improved agriculture , easier trade and smarter services .'
p13088
aS'that is why we are moving on many fronts at the same time , aware of the linkages that make up a comprehensive strategy .'
p13089
aS'i learnt long ago that singaporeans are too well informed about india to be burdened with numbers by a visitor , even from india .'
p13090
aS'in any case , for me , the emergence of india as the fastest growing major economy in the world is less important than what is more enduring : the wheels of change are moving ; confidence is growing ; resolve is stronger ; and , the direction is clearer .'
p13091
aS'and , it is spreading across the nation , as the most distant village and the farthest citizen begin to join the mainstream of national economy .'
p13092
aS'distinguished guests , india and singapore have been together at many crossroads of time .'
p13093
aS'our relationship is written in the pages of history , the footprints of culture , the ties of kinship and the old connection of commerce .'
p13094
aS'we stood together in friendship at the dawn of freedom ; and , we reached out to each other in a partnership of shared hopes .'
p13095
aS'singapores success became an aspiration of indians .'
p13096
aS'and , in turn , india became the hope for a more peaceful , balanced and stable world .'
p13097
aS'as india opened itself , singapore became indias springboard to the world and gateway to the east .'
p13098
aS'no one worked harder for it and no one deserves more credit for it than emeritus senior minister goh chok tong .'
p13099
aS'he re-connected india to singapore and the region .'
p13100
aS'he also opened my eyes to its vast prospects .'
p13101
aS'today , singapore is one of our most important partners in the world .'
p13102
aS'it is a relationship that is as strategic as it is wide-ranging .'
p13103
aS'we have comprehensive defence and security relations .'
p13104
aS'it flows out of shared interests and a common vision .'
p13105
aS'singapore holds regular exercises with and in india .'
p13106
aS'singapore is the biggest investment source and destination for india in the world ; the worlds most connected nation to india ; the largest trading partner in southeast asia ; and , a popular destination for tourists and students .'
p13107
aS'now , as we build the india of our dreams , singapore is already a major partner in that enterprise : world class human resources , smart cities , clean rivers , clean energy , or next generation sustainable infrastructure .'
p13108
aS'starting from the first it park in bengaluru , it now includes the newest state capital in india , amravati in andhra pradesh .'
p13109
aS'our partnership will expand as our economies grow and the framework of trade and investment improves further .'
p13110
aS'but , i have always seen singapore in loftier terms .'
p13111
aS'singapores success in overcoming odds leads me to seek a partnership that addresses the challenges of 21st century from food and water to clean energy and sustainable habitats .'
p13112
aS'and , in many ways , singapore will also influence the course of our region in this century .'
p13113
aS'mr prime minister , distinguished members , this area covers the arc of asia pacific and indian ocean regions .'
p13114
aS'however we choose to define it , the underlining theme of connected histories and interconnected destinies stand out clearly .'
p13115
aS'this is a region of expanding freedom and prosperity .'
p13116
aS'it is home to two of the most populous nations ; some of the worlds largest economies ; and , the worlds most talented and hard working people .'
p13117
aS'asias re-emergence is the greatest phenomenon of our era .'
p13118
aS'from the darkness of the middle of the last century , japan led asias rise .'
p13119
aS'it then extended to southeast asia , korea and china .'
p13120
aS'and , india is now the bright hope for sustaining asian dynamism and prosperity .'
p13121
aS'but , this is also a region with many unsettled questions and unresolved disputes ; of competing claims and contested norms ; of expanding military power and extending shadow of terrorism ; and , uncertainties on seas and vulnerability in cyber space .'
p13122
aS'the region is not an island in a vast ocean , but deeply connected and influenced by the world beyond .'
p13123
aS'we are also a region of disparities within and between states ; where the challenges of habitats , food and water remain ; where our gifts of nature and wealth of traditions feel the pressure of rapid progress ; and , our agriculture and islands are threatened by climate change .'
p13124
aS'asia has seen some of this at different points of its history .'
p13125
aS'but , it has probably never been here before .'
p13126
aS'and , asia is still finding a path through its multiple transitions to a peaceful , stable and prosperous future .'
p13127
aS'it is a journey that must succeed .'
p13128
aS'and , singapore and india must work together to realize it .'
p13129
aS'indias history has been inseparable from asia .'
p13130
aS'there were times when we turned inwards .'
p13131
aS'and now , as we reintegrate more closely with asia , we are returning to history .'
p13132
aS'we are retracing our ancient maritime and land routes with the natural instincts of an ancient relationship .'
p13133
aS'and , in the course of last eighteen months , my government has engaged more with this region than any other in the world .'
p13134
aS'from a new opening with pacific island nations , australia and mongolia to more intense engagement with china , japan , korea and asean members , we have pursued our vision with purpose and vigour .'
p13135
aS'india and china share a boundary and five millennia of continuous engagement .'
p13136
aS'monks and merchants have nurtured our ties and enriched our societies .'
p13137
aS'its a history reflected in the seventh century journey of xuanzang that i have had the privilege of connecting , from my birthplace in gujarat to xian in china , where president xi hosted me this may .'
p13138
aS'we see it in religious texts written in sanskrit , pali , and chinese ; in the letters of the past , exchanged with warmth and grace ; in indias famous tanchoi sarees ; and , in cinapatta , the sanskrit name for silk .'
p13139
aS'today , we constitute two-fifth of humanity and two of the worlds fastest growing major economies .'
p13140
aS'chinas economic transformation is an inspiration for us .'
p13141
aS'and , as it rebalances its economy , and as india steps up the pace of its growth , we can both reinforce each others progress .'
p13142
aS'and , we can advance stability and prosperity in our region .'
p13143
aS'and , together , we can be more effective in addressing our common global challenges , from trade to climate change .'
p13144
aS'we have our unresolved issues , including our boundary question , but we have been able to keep our border region peaceful and stable .'
p13145
aS'and , we have agreed to strengthen strategic communication and expand convergences .'
p13146
aS'we explore shared economic opportunities while addressing common threats like terrorism .'
p13147
aS'india and china will engage constructively across the complexity of their relationship as two self-assured and confident nations , aware of their interests and responsibilities .'
p13148
aS'just as chinas rise has driven the global economy , the world looks to china to help advance global and regional peace and stability .'
p13149
aS'india and japan may have discovered each other somewhat later .'
p13150
aS'but , my friend , prime minister abe , showed me in the magnificent shrines of kyoto the symbols of our much longer spiritual engagement .'
p13151
aS'and , more than a hundred years ago , as swami vivekananda reached the shores of japan , he exhorted the indian youth to go east to japan .'
p13152
aS'independent india took that advice seriously .'
p13153
aS'there are few partnerships that enjoy so much goodwill in india as our relations with japan .'
p13154
aS'no nation has contributed so much to indias modernization and progress japan cars , metros and industrial parks , for example .'
p13155
aS'and , no partner is likely to play as big a role in indias transformation as japan .'
p13156
aS'we do more together now .'
p13157
aS'we see this as a strategic partnership that is vital for securing a peaceful and stable asia , pacific and indian ocean regions .'
p13158
aS'with korea and australia , our relationships started with strong economic foundations , and have become strategic in content .'
p13159
aS'and , asean is the anchor of our act east policy .'
p13160
aS'we are linked by geography and history , united against many common challenges and bound by many shared aspirations .'
p13161
aS'with each asean member , we have deepening political , security , defence and economic ties .'
p13162
aS'and , as asean community leads the way to regional integration , we look forward to a more dynamic partnership between india and asean that holds rich potential for our 1.'
p13163
aS'9 billion people .'
p13164
aS'with almost the entire region , india has frameworks of economic cooperation .'
p13165
aS'we want to be more deeply integrated with the regional economy .'
p13166
aS'and , we will upgrade our partnership agreements and work for an early conclusion of regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement .'
p13167
aS'in the flux and transition of our times , the most critical need in this region is to uphold and strengthen the rules and norms that must define our collective behavior .'
p13168
aS'this is why we must all come together , in east asia summit and other forums , to build a cooperative and collaborative future , not on the strength of a few , but on the consent of all .'
p13169
aS'india will work with countries in the region and beyond , including the united states and russia , our east asia summit partners , to ensure that our commons - ocean , space and cyber remain avenues of shared prosperity , not become new theatres of contests .'
p13170
aS'india will lend its strength to keep the seas safe , secure and free for the benefit of all .'
p13171
aS'this is an age of inter-dependence when nations must come together , to realize the promise of this century .'
p13172
aS'we must also do so because our pressing challenges are not from one another , but common to each of us .'
p13173
aS'terrorism is one such major global challenge , and a force larger than individual groups .'
p13174
aS'its shadow stretches across our societies and our nations , both in recruitment and choice of targets .'
p13175
aS'it does not just take a toll of lives , but can derail economies .'
p13176
aS'the world must speak in one voice and act in unison .'
p13177
aS'there will be political , legal , military and intelligence efforts .'
p13178
aS'but , we must do more .'
p13179
aS'countries also must be held accountable for sanctuaries , support , arms and funds .'
p13180
aS'nations must cooperate more with each other .'
p13181
aS'societies must reach out within and to each other .'
p13182
aS'we must delink terrorism from religion , and assert the human values that define every faith .'
p13183
aS'we are a few days away from paris , where we must achieve concrete outcome , in accordance with the principles of un framework convention on climate change .'
p13184
aS'this is especially important for our region , particularly the small island states .'
p13185
aS'friends , ours is a region of enormous promise .'
p13186
aS'but , we know that enduring peace and prosperity are not inevitable .'
p13187
aS'so , we must work hard to realize our vision of an asian century .'
p13188
aS'asia has the wisdom of its ancient cultures and all the great religions of the world .'
p13189
aS'it also has the energy and drive of youth .'
p13190
aS'as asias first nobel laureate rabindranath tagore predicted on a visit to this region nearly a century ago , asia is regaining its self-consciousness for realization of its own self .'
p13191
aS'here in singapore , where the regions currents merge ; its diversity converges ; ideas meet ; and , aspirations gather wings , i feel that we are closer to that vision than ever before .'
p13192
aS'and as india pursues its transformation and strives for a peaceful and stable world , singapore will be a major partner on that journey .'

aS'thank you .'

p13197
aS'it is a matter of great pleasure to be here with you .'
p13198
aS'i am really happy to address the india-singapore economic convention .'
p13199
aS'my visit has been very productive and positive .'
p13200
aS'i had excellent meetings with singapore leaders today morning .'
p13201
aS'we have concluded the strategic partnership which takes the relationship to a new level of engagement .'
p13202
aS'we have set a high level of ambition for this relationship .'
p13203
aS'friends !'
p13204
aS'our historical ties and cultural proximity are our assets .'
p13205
aS'a large indian diaspora is enriching the life and work environment of singapore .'
p13206
aS'in recent years , economic engagement has been a key driver of our relationship .'
p13207
aS'singapore is our 10th largest trade partner globally .'
p13208
aS'it is also the 2nd largest in asean .'
p13209
aS'bilateral trade has expanded manifold after the conclusion of comprehensive economic cooperation agreement in 2005 .'
p13210
aS'singapore has emerged as the 2nd largest sourceof fdi into india .'
p13211
aS'outward indian fdi to singapore has also increased in recent times .'
p13212
aS'singapore is now one of the top destinations for indian investments .'
p13213
aS'a significantly large number of indian companies are registered in singapore .'
p13214
aS'singapore companies also have a level of familiarity with indian market due to involvement over the past few decades .'
p13215
aS'our companies are positioned to explore and develop promising engagements .'
p13216
aS'with the significant and growing number of companies of both sides and of foreign companies in both markets , i expect even more exciting partnerships.'
p13217
aS'- you have the habit of precision ; india has the scope for expansion ; - you are fond of going vertical ; indias development is both vertical and horizontal- you are an exciting incubator ; india is a vast laboratorythus , singapore and india can work together in many promising areas .'
p13218
aS'last month , i had the opportunity of laying the foundation of two projects in india with participation of singapore .'
p13219
aS'one is the new capital city of andhra pradeshamaravati .'
p13220
aS'singapore is involved in preparation of the master plan for this new city .'
p13221
aS'secondly , i have laid the foundation stone for the fourth container terminal at jnpt , mumbai which is being built in partnership with psa , singapore .'
p13222
aS'we are also exploring collaboration with changi airport to operate two indianairports .'
p13223
aS'these are recent examples of the deepening of our economic partnership .'
p13224
aS'singapore is also an important and valuable friend of india in our global outlook .'
p13225
aS'we regard singapore as an essential ally in the implementation of our look and act east policy .'
p13226
aS'i am fully aware of the important role singapore has played in the implementation of this policy .'
p13227
aS'i look forward to working with singapore in a bigger way .'
p13228
aS'beyond the bilateral scope , there are also significant opportunities through collaboration with third countries .'
p13229
aS'one example is the asean economic community which has come into effect .'
p13230
aS'it is going to create a 2 trillion us dollar market of 600 million people .'
p13231
aS'it will further enable our businesses to jointly explore opportunities in the wider south east asian region .'
p13232
aS'the regional comprehensive economic partnership ( rcep ) , comprising asean and its six dialogue partners , is another potential opportunity for our companies .'
p13233
aS'recently , in the india africa forum summit held in new delhi , singapore was a special invitee .'
p13234
aS'this is recognition of another dimension of india-singapore togetherness .'
p13235
aS'we can work jointly in the african countries .'
p13236
aS'ladies and gentlemen !'
p13237
aS'india is undergoing economic and social transformation on a scale and a speed that is unmatched in history .'
p13238
aS'our growth rate was 7.'
p13239
aS'3 % in the last year .'
p13240
aS'world bank has projected even better growth this year .'
p13241
aS'indian economy is the fastest growing economy among major countries .'
p13242
aS'we are also working hard that the benefits of this growth reaches to the common man .'
p13243
aS'we have launched major schemes on financial inclusion .'
p13244
aS'our strategy is to : - energise the economy- empower the people- fund the un-funded - secure the poor - and enhance the income level of all .'
p13245
aS'money must reach the marginalized .'
p13246
aS'with this objective , we opened 190 million new bank accounts .'
p13247
aS'through them , we are trying to ensure direct transfer of benefits to the poor .'
p13248
aS'this targeting is also bringing discipline in government expenditure .'
p13249
aS'we have also launched new insurance and pension schemes .'
p13250
aS'through a new bank , called mudra , we are funding the small traders and businessmen .'
p13251
aS'we have set time bound goals for providing access to housing , water , electricity and sanitationfor all .'
p13252
aS'thus , india is now the next frontier of economic revolution .'
p13253
aS'our changing paradigm has created new opportunities for global investor community .'
p13254
aS'these opportunities range from building 50 million affordable houses to setting up 100 smart cities ; modernization of railway network and re-development of our railway stations to setting up new railway corridors ; generation of 175 gw of renewable energy to transmission and distribution networks .'
p13255
aS'construction of national highways , bridges , and metro rail networks .'
p13256
aS'such a huge potential for creation of infrastructure and production of goods will not be available in any other country .'
p13257
aS'more importantly , no one place on the earth can offer the customer base on such a massive scale .'
p13258
aS'we are trying to harness this development potential through our policies and people .'
p13259
aS'the campaigns like digital india and skill india are designed to prepare the people to take part in this process .'
p13260
aS'we have witnessed massive growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past .'
p13261
aS'some of these have begun to challenge established global players .'
p13262
aS'to tap this energy fully , we have recently launched the start up india campaign .'
p13263
aS'start up india , stand up india .'
p13264
aS'friends !'
p13265
aS'in past few months , the interest of foreign investors in india has gone up tremendously .'
p13266
aS'however , there were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on their sentiments .'
p13267
aS'we have taken very decisive steps to remove many of long the pending concerns .'
p13268
aS'to give you some examples : - we have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance ; - we have greatly liberalised the licencing regime ; - we have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years ; - we have taken almost 60 % of the defence items out of the licensing process and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate for the exports - we have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation - and we demonstrated this position in a number of ways - we have introduced the concept of composite sector caps for the fpis and other foreign investors .'
p13269
aS'- we have notified the regulations for the alternative investment funds and - we have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for real estate investment trusts - we have modified the permanent establishment norms ; - we have also decided to defer the implementation of the general anti-avoidance rules for two years ; - we have introduced the gst bill in parliament ; we are hopeful to roll it out in 2016 ; - a new bankruptcy code and a new ipr policy is being drafted - the company law tribunal is going to be formed soon .'
p13270
aS'- our system for transparent auction and allocation of key natural resources like coal , spectrum , and iron ore has now become stable .'
p13271
aS'these are just a few examples .'
p13272
aS'we are working hard to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable .'
p13273
aS'we are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters .'
p13274
aS'to this objective we have already made a number of corrections .'
p13275
aS'as a result of our initiatives : - the sentiments for inflow of foreign investment are turning into commitments ; - fdi inflows have gone up by 40 % compared with previous years corresponding period .'
p13276
aS'- perceptions are turning into positive outcome- - we have jumped 12 ranks in the latest ranking by the world bank on ease of doing business .'
p13277
aS'- india climbs to become the worlds 7th most valued nation brand with a 32 % sprint in brand value .'
p13278
aS'- india has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several agencies and institutions .'
p13279
aS'- india has also improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness .'
p13280
aS'we were 15th place so far .'
p13281
aS'now we are at 9th place .'
p13282
aS'- india has also jumped 16 places on the world economic forums global competitive index .'
p13283
aS'- moodys have upgraded the rating of india as positive .'
p13284
aS'thus , just in eighteen months , we have successfully restored the credibility of india in the eyes of global players .'
p13285
aS'as soon as my government took over , we started liberalizing the fdi regime alongwith other reforms .'
p13286
aS'we allowed 100 % fdi in railways and enhanced the fdi limit to 49 % in defence and insurance .'
p13287
aS'we are also conscious of the last mile operational issues in such policies .'
p13288
aS'in that spirit , we are finetuning the procedures also .'
p13289
aS'early this month , we have taken very dynamic steps tofurther open up the economy for fdi .'
p13290
aS'with this last round of reforms : - india is among the most open economies for fdi .'
p13291
aS'- some new sectors have been fully opened for fdi - for most of the sectors , fdi clearances are now on automatic route- in addition to greenfield areas , many sectors can freely absorb fdi in brownfield projects .'
p13292
aS'this includes roads , construction and medical devices .'
p13293
aS'- entry and exit conditions have been greatly relaxed for fdifriends !'
p13294
aS'we are keen to scale up investments in next generation infrastructure including digital networks and clean energy .'
p13295
aS'in addition to the core infrastructure , we are keen to invest in our social , industrial and agri-infrastructure to give better income and quality of life to our people .'
p13296
aS'with tight control over expenditure , we have greatly increased capital investment by the public sector .'
p13297
aS'to leverage this , we are setting up national investment and infrastructure fund .'
p13298
aS'we are also coming up with tax free infrastructure bonds with a view to broaden the corporate bond market .'
p13299
aS'this will also provide long term finance for infrastructure .'
p13300
aS'for infrastructure , we have also decided to launch rupee bonds in some countries .'
p13301
aS'singapore could be among them .'
p13302
aS'we are quiteeager to work with singapore in this regard .'
p13303
aS'friends !'
p13304
aS'about 800 million people in india are below the age of 35 years .'
p13305
aS'their aspirations , energy , enterprise and skills will be the force for indias economic transformation .'
p13306
aS'but the immediate challenge is to productively employ the youth .'
p13307
aS'for meeting this challenge , we need to provide a huge push to manufacturing which has stagnated at around 16 % of the gdp for several decades .'
p13308
aS'this share must reach around 25 % in the short and medium term .'
p13309
aS'with this in view , we have launched the make inindia initiative .'
p13310
aS'we are working on all fronts to make india a global manufacturing hub .'
p13311
aS'we are creating the global skill pool to establish a modern economy with a world class manufacturing sector .'
p13312
aS'to achieve these objectives , apart from vigorous exercise for ease of doing business , we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure .'
p13313
aS'the hall mark of our strategy is good governance which is participative and policy driven .'
p13314
aS'through ppp , we are encouraging private investments in areas where earlier only government used to invest .'
p13315
aS'we are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises , to instill market discipline .'
p13316
aS'we are consistently working to integrate our economy with the rest of the world .'
p13317
aS'i hope to further dedicate the next three months to address even the remotest issues affecting free flow of capital and business to india .'
p13318
aS'friends !'
p13319
aS'whatever we are doing ; it is driven by two basic commitments : one is that our people should be in the center .'
p13320
aS'it is for them that we want investments .'
p13321
aS'our faster growth will transform lives of one sixth of global community .'
p13322
aS'the second commitment is towards our climate , our planet , our nature .'
p13323
aS'our commitment to mitigate the dangers of climate change do not arise from economics or politics .'
p13324
aS'they also do not arise from fear or favour .'
p13325
aS'they arise from our fundamental belief that nature is our mother .'
p13326
aS'nature provides and sustains our life ; hence we must nurture it .'
p13327
aS'it is an article of faith .'
p13328
aS'i assure the global community that we will do more than required .'
p13329
aS'we will stretch ourselves to do more than what wecan normally do .'
p13330
aS'both these commitments generate a wave of economic opportunities and activities which can not be matched by any other country .'
p13331
aS'they also open up enormous opportunities for investors .'
p13332
aS'to sum up ; i would like to say that in the last eighteen months , - reforms are happening in a big way .'
p13333
aS'they are now reaching to the last mile ; - reform is to transform the systems so that they perform ; - simply put , they aim at enabling the people to realise their potentials and dreams ; - putting even more simply , it means more charm on the faces and less forms in offices ; - in addition , new frontiers and deeper foundations for financial markets have been laid ; - all together , runways for take off of the economy have been made .'
p13334
aS'recently , the imf chief has said that india is a bright spot in the global economy .'
p13335
aS'i did not want to wait for that brightness to reach to you on its own .'
p13336
aS'hence , i am here .'
p13337
aS'i am here to invite you to india in a bigger way .'
p13338
aS'i have also come to assure you that i am there to carefully hold your hands .'
p13339
aS'thank you !'
p13340
aS'very much , thank you .'
p13341
aa(lp13342
S'president hollande , excellencies , the pain of paris is yet to heal .'
p13343
aS'so , i speak in admiration for your resilience and resolve .'
p13344
aS'and , i salute the world for standing , in full strength , with france and paris .'
p13345
aS'over the next few days , we will decide the fate of this planet .'
p13346
aS'we do so when the consequences of the industrial age powered by fossil fuel are evident , especially on the lives of the poor .'
p13347
aS'the prosperous still have a strong carbon footprint .'
p13348
aS'and , the worlds billions at the bottom of the development ladder are seeking space to grow .'
p13349
aS'so , the choices are not easy .'
p13350
aS'but , we have awareness and technology .'
p13351
aS'we need now national will and a genuine global partnership .'
p13352
aS'democratic india must grow rapidly to meet the aspirations of 1.'
p13353
aS'25 billion people , 300 million of whom are without access to energy .'
p13354
aS'we are determined to do so , guided by our ancient belief that people and planet are inseparable ; that human well being and nature are indivisible .'
p13355
aS'so , we have set ambitious targets .'
p13356
aS'by 2030 , we will reduce emissions by 33 to 35 % per cent of 2005 levels , and 40 per cent of our installed capacity will be from our non- fossil fuels .'
p13357
aS'we will achieve it by expanding renewable energy - for , example , by adding 175 gigawatts of renewable generation by 2022 .'
p13358
aS'we will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.'
p13359
aS'5 billion tonnes worth of carbon dioxide .'
p13360
aS'we are reducing dependence on fossil fuel through levies and reduction in subsidies ; switching sources of fuel where possible ; and , transforming cities and public transportation .'
p13361
aS'we hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely .'
p13362
aS'it is not just a question of historical responsibility .'
p13363
aS'they also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact .'
p13364
aS'and , climate justice demands that , with the little carbon space we still have , developing countries should have enough room to grow .'
p13365
aS'this also means aggressive mitigation action by developed countries before 2020 , including ratification of 2nd commitment period of kyoto protocol , removing conditions and revisiting targets .'
p13366
aS'the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities must remain the bedrock of our collective enterprise across all areas - mitigation , adaptation and means for implementation .'
p13367
aS'anything else would be morally wrong ; and disparities .'
p13368
aS'equity means that national commitments must be consistent with the carbon space nations occupy .'
p13369
aS'we also need a strong agreement on adaptation and loss and damage .'
p13370
aS'developed countries must fulfill their responsibility to make clean energy available , affordable and accessible to all in the developing world .'
p13371
aS'this is in our collective interest .'
p13372
aS'so , we look to the developed countries to mobilize 100 billion us dollars annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in the developing countries .'
p13373
aS'they must fulfill their commitment in a credible , transparent and meaningful manner .'
p13374
aS'energy is a basic human need .'
p13375
aS'so , we need an ambitious technology initiative , driven by a public purpose , not just market incentives .'
p13376
aS'this includes intellectual property .'
p13377
aS'for this , we need to scale up green climate fund that will improve access to technology and intellectual property .'
p13378
aS'we still need conventional energy .'
p13379
aS'we should make it clean , not impose an end to its use .'
p13380
aS'and , there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others .'
p13381
aS'we welcome stocktaking that is transparent , covers both support and commitments , and based on differentiation .'
p13382
aS'ultimately , for success , moderating our lifestyle is necessary , and possible , for a low carbon future .'
p13383
aS'excellencies , the presence of 196 countries tells us that we have a chance to unite behind a common purpose .'
p13384
aS'we will succeed if we have the wisdom and courage to craft a genuinely collective partnership that balances responsibilities and capabilities with aspirations and needs .'
p13385
aS'i am confident that we will .'
p13386
aS'thank you .'

S'my ministerial colleagues , shri prakash javadekarji , shri piyush goyalji , distinguished guests i am delighted to inaugurate the indian pavilion .'
p13389
aS'this is the first day of a historic summit in paris .'
p13390
aS'we stand here in solidarity with paris and france and in admiration for their resolve and courage .'
p13391
aS'the entire world , 196 nations , have come together to shape the future of this world and the health of our planet .'
p13392
aS'this summit is of great significance to indias future , too .'
p13393
aS'this pavilion is a window to our heritage and our progress ; our traditions and our technology ; our aspirations and our achievements .'
p13394
aS'indias new economic momentum is a subject of international attention and a source of global opportunity .'
p13395
aS'our progress will not just change the lives of one-sixth of humanity .'
p13396
aS'it will also mean a more successful and prosperous world .'
p13397
aS'equally , the choices the world makes here will have an impact on our development .'
p13398
aS'climate change is a major global challenge .'
p13399
aS'but , climate change is not of our making .'
p13400
aS'it is the result of global warming that came from the prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel .'
p13401
aS'but , we in india face its consequences today .'
p13402
aS'we see it in the risks of our farmers , the changes in weather patterns , and the intensity of natural disasters .'
p13403
aS'we are concerned about the rising oceans that will threaten our 7500 km of coastline and over 1300 islands .'
p13404
aS'we worry about the retreat of glaciers that feed our rivers and nurture our civilisation .'
p13405
aS'that is why the outcome in paris so important .'
p13406
aS'that is why we are here .'
p13407
aS'we want the world to act with urgency .'
p13408
aS'we want a comprehensive , equitable and durable agreement , which must lead us to restore the balance between humanity and nature and between what we have inherited and what we will leave behind .'
p13409
aS'this will mean a partnership in which those who have the luxury of choices and the capability of technology will make adjustments to sharply reduce their carbon emission .'
p13410
aS'the extent of their commitment and the strength of their action must be consistent with the carbon space they occupy .'
p13411
aS'and , they must leave enough of what is left of our carbon space to let developing countries grow .'
p13412
aS'they should share resources and technology with those who live between want and hope , so that we can meet the universal aspiration for clean energy .'
p13413
aS'it will also mean that the developing world will also try to have a lighter carbon footprint on their growth path .'
p13414
aS'we want the conviction of the world to be matched by efforts to create conditions in which we can succeed .'
p13415
aS'because our challenge is pressing , our efforts must be urgent .'
p13416
aS'friends , these will be the subject of negotiations over the next few days .'
p13417
aS'i am here in the indian pavilion to say something else .'
p13418
aS'and , i speak not just to the world , but also to our people .'
p13419
aS'indias progress is our destiny and the right of our people .'
p13420
aS'but , we are a nation that must also lead in combating climate change .'
p13421
aS'it stems from our obligation to give our people clean air ; clean rivers ; resilient farms ; healthy habitats ; and , forests rich with life .'
p13422
aS'it comes from our conviction that we must aim not just for higher incomes , but better quality of life .'
p13423
aS'it comes from our commitment to the world .'
p13424
aS'above all , it arises , from our timeless traditions and beliefs .'
p13425
aS'the choices a people make are shaped by their culture and beliefs .'
p13426
aS'in india , nature has always been treated as mother .'
p13427
aS'since ancient times , we have seen humanity as part of nature , not superior to it .'
p13428
aS'the divine has manifested in natures diverse forms .'
p13429
aS'we have always believed that nature does not exist for human race , but that we cant exist without nature .'
p13430
aS'so , nature is meant to provide and nurture , not to exploit .'
p13431
aS'when nature is in equilibrium , our lives and our world will be in balance .'
p13432
aS'this is what we learn from kshetrapati sukta in our rig veda .'
p13433
aS'this means : o lord of field , with the sweet waves of mother natures blessings , may you milk our fields like the milk of a cow with the sweetness of mother natures bounty , which falls like clarified butter , may you shed your grace on us .'
p13434
aS'this is why atharva-veda calls it a bounden duty that we must protect the earth so that life can be sustained .'
p13435
aS'this is what we see in gandhijis life and his advice that the world has enough for everyones need but not for anyones greed .'
p13436
aS'this is what we have tried to capture in the publication parampara that we have released today .'
p13437
aS'this is why recycling and conservation comes naturally to us .'
p13438
aS'and , why we have sacred groves across our nation .'
p13439
aS'friends , and , it is this spirit that leads us to set an ambitious and comprehensive strategy to combat climate change .'
p13440
aS'we have a target for renewable generation of 175 gigawatt by 2022 .'
p13441
aS'we have got off to a good start , with nearly 12 gw likely to be installed by 2016 , more than three times the current capacity .'
p13442
aS'like cellular phones before , we can use renewable energy to bring power to our 18000 unconnected villages quickly and cleanly .'
p13443
aS'by 2030 , 40 % of our installed capacity will be based on non-fossil fuel .'
p13444
aS'we will convert waste to energy .'
p13445
aS'we will make our cities smart and sustainable , and transform public transportation , including through 50 new metro rail projects .'
p13446
aS'we are investing in supercritical technology in thermal plants .'
p13447
aS'we have imposed tax on coal and reduced subsidies on petroleum products .'
p13448
aS'we are raising fuel standards for automobiles .'
p13449
aS'and , we have introduced tax free bonds for renewable energy .'
p13450
aS'we have a massive programme to expand our forest cover and protect our biodiversity .'
p13451
aS'in the past few months , millions of households have switched to led bulbs and we have plans to replace diesel by fuel cells to power the thousands of our telecom towers .'
p13452
aS"our vision of india as a global manufacturing hub rests on the simple principle of  zero defect , zero effect '' production that is perfect and leaves no footprint on environment ."
p13453
aS"our mission of  more crop per drop '' will not only improve the lives of farmers , but will also reduce the pressure on a scarce resource ."
p13454
aS'and , research and innovation in clean energy is a high priority .'
p13455
aS'we want to make conventional energy , like coal , cleaner .'
p13456
aS'we will make renewable energy cheaper and convenient to install even in our homes .'
p13457
aS'we want to make it more reliable and easier to feed into our transmission lines .'
p13458
aS'from governments to communities , there are countless examples of innovation and enterprise that are restoring the health of our environment .'
p13459
aS'i have tried to capture some of these initiatives in my book , convenient action , which we shall present today .'
p13460
aS'friends , this is the voice of our people , the call of our nation and the consensus of our polity .'
p13461
aS'indias leadership on environment has been the vision of indian leaders and successive governments from stockholm in 1975 to copenhagen in 2009 .'
p13462
aS'we are raising our national effort to an entirely new level .'
p13463
aS'and , we are intensifying our international partnerships .'
p13464
aS'so , we come to paris with our commitment , but we also come with hope .'
p13465
aS'so , we approach the negotiations under the un framework convention on climate change in a spirit of partnership , which must be based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities .'
p13466
aS'later today , i will join leaders from major developed and developing world for an innovation summit ; because i believe that innovation and technology hold the key to our collective success .'
p13467
aS'president hollande and i will also co-chair the launch of my long cherished dream of an international solar alliance to promote greater use of solar energy in the 121 solar-rich nations .'
p13468
aS'to call the world to look deep into the ancient wisdom of all our civilisations , cultures and religions , i had requested president hollande to bring out a book of quotations from around the world .'
p13469
aS'i am happy that we will release it today .'
p13470
aS'and , i will also call for a change in lifestyles , so that we reduce the burden on our planet .'
p13471
aS'for , the enduring success of our efforts will depend on the way we live and think .'
p13472
aS'in conclusion , therefore , let me return to the theme that defines us in india the spirit of partnership , the belief in oneness with the whole that is nature .'
p13473
aS'to the people of india and our friends in the world , i call you to live with the commitment of lokah samastah sukhinau bhavantu .'
p13474
aS'the desire for well being should include our planet , our nature , all countries and the entire humanity .'
p13475
aS'if our thinking is right , we will form a true global partnership of capabilities and needs that leads us to a low carbon age .'
p13476
aS'thank you .'
p13477
aa(lp13478
S'president hollande , president obama , excellencies , mr bill gates , distinguished guests , let me begin by saluting president hollande and the people of france for their courage and resolve ; and , to the world for coming together for paris and france .'
p13479
aS'the outstanding arrangements reflect the character of this great nation .'
p13480
aS'the world has assembled in paris to change the course of our planet to a sustainable path .'
p13481
aS'we must speak about goals and targets on carbon emissions and rise in global temperature .'
p13482
aS'but , it is just as important to focus on the instruments that will make it natural and easy for the world to get there .'
p13483
aS'a vast section of humanity lives at the edge of poverty and in darkness after the sun sets .'
p13484
aS'they need energy to light up their homes and power their future .'
p13485
aS'and , they are also the most vulnerable to the consequences of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel .'
p13486
aS'access to energy and a better life is a universal aspiration .'
p13487
aS'and , so are clean environment and healthy habitats .'
p13488
aS'as the worlds majority works its way to prosperity on a planet left with very limited carbon space , we have to do many things .'

aS'that will make clean energy technology available , accessible and affordable for all .'
p13503

aS'if we raise the level of our efforts , we can transform the world .'
p13511
aS'we will also lay the foundation of a new economy in new low carbon age .'
p13512
aS'we will restore the balance between ecology and economy , and between our inheritance and obligation to the future .'

p13518
aS'i am sure you can feel a difference , and not just because of indian navys hospitality .'
p13519
aS'kochi is at the head of the indian ocean and at the crossroads of our maritime history .'
p13520
aS'indias history has been influenced by the seas .'
p13521
aS'and , the passage to our future prosperity and security also lies on this ocean .'
p13522
aS'it also holds the key to the fortunes of the world .'
p13523
aS'this aircraft carrier is the instrument of our maritime power and a symbol of our maritime responsibility .'
p13524
aS'the indian armed forces have always been known not just for the power they represent , but by the maturity and responsibility with which they wield it .'
p13525
aS'they defend our seas and protect our borders .'
p13526
aS'they keep our nation secure and our citizens safe .'
p13527
aS'and , in calamity and conflicts , they do more than just bring relief and hope to our people .'
p13528
aS'they lift the spirit of the nation and win the trust of the world .'
p13529
aS'in chennai , you battled the fury of rain and the river to save lives .'
p13530
aS'in nepal , you served with courage , humility and compassion .'
p13531
aS'and , as in nepal , in yemens conflict , you held out your hand to every human in distress , not just fellow citizens .'
p13532
aS'our forces reflect our nations diversity and its unity .'
p13533
aS'they embody the timeless culture of india and the finest tradition of our military .'

p13536
aS'i pay homage to those who made the supreme sacrifice , in silence and service , so that india marches ahead .'
p13537
aS'our thoughts are with the soldiers keeping vigil on the harshest frontiers of the world ; with their families that say uncertain farewells when they leave home ; and , their loved ones who must sometimes bear their coffins .'
p13538
aS'i know how an officer , in the prime of his youth , feels when he does not make the next grade , not because he was not outstanding or was less deserving , but because the room above was small .'
p13539
aS'so , to honour your service and uphold your welfare will always be our solemn duty .'
p13540
aS'for this reason , we have moved with speed to implement the one rank one pension promise that had remained unfulfilled for decades .'

aS'and , we will build the national war memorial and museum that you so richly deserve in the heart of our nations capital .'
p13542

p13543
aS'i also pay tribute to our internal security forces .'
p13544

aS'this is important for indias prosperity , and also our security .'
p13556
aS'in an inter-dependent world , indias transformation is closely linked with our international partnerships .'
p13557
aS'and , so is our security .'
p13558
aS'so , there is new intensity and purpose in our foreign policy .'
p13559
aS'in the east , we have strengthened our traditional partnerships with japan , korea and asean .'
p13560
aS'we have made new openings in the region , including with australia , mongolia and pacific islands .'
p13561

aS'we have retraced our ancient links to central asia .'
p13564

aS'russia has always been a source of strength for us .'
p13566
aS'it remains important for our future , too .'
p13567
aS'with the united states , we have advanced our partnership in a comprehensive manner , including in defence .'
p13568
aS'our strategic partnerships in europe have deepened .'
p13569
aS'across the world , india is seen not just as a new bright spot of the global economy .'
p13570
aS'it is also seen as an anchor for regional and global peace , security and stability .'
p13571
aS'and , as the world seeks to deal with rising threat of terrorism and radicalism , countries across all regions , including in the islamic world , have reached out to seek cooperation with india .'
p13572
aS'above all , it is our neighbourhood that is most critical for our future and for our place in the world .'
p13573
aS'but , ours is a difficult neighbourhood with the full spectrum of security challenges .'
p13574
aS'we see terrorism and ceasefire violations ; reckless nuclear build up and threats ; border transgressions ; and , continuing military modernization and expansion .'
p13575
aS'the shadow of west asian instability is becoming longer .'
p13576
aS'beyond that , our region is marked by uncertain political transitions , weak institutions and internal conflicts .'
p13577
aS'and , major powers have also increased their engagement in our land and maritime neighbourhood .'
p13578
aS'from maldives and sri lanka in the seas to nepal and bhutan in the mountains , we are working to safeguard our interests and our relationships .'
p13579
aS'the land boundary agreement has boosted our growing relationship and security cooperation with bangladesh .'
p13580
aS'we are engaging pakistan to try and turn the course of history , bring an end to terrorism , build peaceful relations , advance cooperation and promote stability and prosperity in our region .'
p13581
aS'there are many challenges and barriers on the path .'
p13582
aS'but , the effort is worth it , because the peace dividends are huge and the future of our children is at stake .'
p13583
aS'so , we will test their intentions to define the path ahead .'
p13584
aS'for this , we have started a new nsa-level dialogue to bring security experts face to face with each other .'
p13585
aS'but , we will never drop our guard on security and we will continue to judge progress on their commitments on terrorism .'
p13586
aS'we remain committed to help the great afghan people build a united , peaceful , prosperous and democratic nation .'
p13587
aS'we are also pursuing closer relations with china to harness the full potential of our economic partnership .'
p13588
aS'we will aim to address outstanding issues , maintain stability on the border , and develop greater mutual understanding and trust in our overlapping neighbourhood .'
p13589
aS'i believe that india and china can engage constructively across the complexity of their relationship as two self-assured and confident nations , aware of their interests and responsibilities .'
p13590
aS'we will continue to strengthen our defence capabilities and infrastructure , engage our neighbours more closely and strengthen our regional and global partnerships , including in maritime security .'
p13591
aS'in a world of rapid changes , india faces familiar threats and new ones .'
p13592
aS'our challenges cover land , sea and air at the same time .'
p13593
aS'it includes the full range , from terrorism to conventional threat to a nuclear environment .'
p13594
aS'our responsibilities are no longer confined to our borders and coastlines .'
p13595
aS'they extend to our interests and citizens , spread across a world of widespread and unpredictable risks .'
p13596
aS'as our world gets transformed , the character of economies change and technology evolves , the nature of conflicts and the objectives of war will also change .'
p13597
aS'we know that old rivalries can play out in new theatres such as space and cyber .'
p13598
aS'and , new technologies offer us new ways to be more effective against both traditional and new challenges .'
p13599
aS'so , we in india must be ready for the present and prepare for the future .'
p13600
aS'india is confident that our defence forces are prepared to deter and defeat any misadventure .'
p13601
aS'our strategic deterrence is robust and reliable , in accordance with our nuclear doctrine , and our political will is clear .'
p13602
aS'we have speeded up the process of defence procurements .'
p13603
aS'we have approved many long pending acquisitions .'
p13604
aS'we are taking firm steps to address shortages and cater for replacements .'
p13605
aS'we are advancing the pace of expansion of border infrastructure and improve the mobility of our forces and equipment .'
p13606
aS'this includes the strategic railways to the border region .'
p13607
aS'we are transforming defence manufacturing in india through radically new policies and initiatives .'
p13608
aS'our public sector is gearing up to the challenge .'
p13609
aS'the private sector has responded with great enthusiasm .'
p13610
aS'and , foreign defence companies are coming here with ambitious new proposals for make in india , from fighter jets and helicopters to transport aircraft and uavs ; from avionics to advanced material .'
p13611
aS'we can never call ourselves a secure nation and a strong military power unless we develop domestic capabilities .'
p13612
aS'this will also reduce capital costs and inventories .'
p13613
aS'in addition , it will be a huge catalyst for industry , employment and economic growth in india .'
p13614
aS'we will soon reform our procurement policies and process .'
p13615
aS'and , our offsets policy will become a strategic tool for improving our capabilities in defence technologies .'
p13616
aS'defence technology will now be a national endeavour that taps the potential of all institutions in our country .'
p13617
aS'armed forces will be crucial to the success of make in india mission .'
p13618
aS'i am encouraged by your localization plans , especially in the capital intensive navy and air force .'
p13619
aS'we want to see clear targets and goals on domestic acquisition ; more clarity on specifications ; and , greater involvement of our forces in innovation , design and development , especially from those who wield the weapons in the field .'
p13620
aS'above all , we look to our armed forces to prepare for the future .'
p13621
aS'and , it can not be achieved by doing more of the same , or preparing perspective plans based on outdated doctrines and disconnected from financial realities .'
p13622
aS'in the course of the past year , i have seen progress , but i also feel that our forces and our government need to do more to reform their beliefs , doctrines , objectives and strategies .'
p13623
aS'we must define our aims and our instruments for the changing world .'
p13624
aS'at a time when major powers are reducing their forces and rely more on technology , we are still constantly seeking to expand the size of our forces .'
p13625
aS'modernisation and expansion of forces at the same time is a difficult and unnecessary goal .'
p13626
aS'we need forces that are agile , mobile and driven by technology , not just human valour .'
p13627
aS'we need capabilities to win swift wars , for we will not have the luxury of long drawn battles .'
p13628
aS'we must re-examine our assumptions that keep massive funds locked up in inventories .'
p13629
aS'as our security horizons and responsibilities extend beyond our shores and borders , we must prepare our forces for range and mobility .'
p13630
aS'we must fully incorporate the power of digital networks and space assets into our capabilities .'
p13631
aS'equally , we must be prepared to defend them , for they will be the first targets of our adversaries .'
p13632
aS'and , networks must be seamless and integrated across agencies and forces , and are precise , clear and quick in response .'
p13633
aS'we have been slow to reform the structures of our armed forces .'
p13634
aS'we should shorten the tooth-to-tail ratio .'
p13635
aS'and , we should promote jointness across every level of our armed forces .'
p13636
aS'we wear different colours , but we serve the same cause and bear the same flag .'
p13637
aS'jointness at the top is a need that is long overdue .'
p13638
aS'senior military leaders must have experience of tri-service commands , experience in technology-driven environment and exposure to the full spectrum of challenges from terrorism to strategic .'
p13639
aS'we need military commanders who not only lead brilliantly in the field , but are also thought leaders who guide our forces and security systems into the future .'
p13640
aS'we should learn from the experience of the others , but we must frame our systems and commands on our own genius .'
p13641
aS'our national defence university will be a reality soon .'
p13642
aS'we also need reforms in senior defence management .'
p13643
aS'it is sad that many defence reform measures proposed in the past have not been implemented .'
p13644
aS'this is an area of priority for me .'
p13645
aS'we must also have a comprehensive strategy for external defence engagement , to develop our capabilities and fulfill our responsibilities to advance peace and stability , including in our extended maritime region .'
p13646
aS'we have kept peace in the blue helmet of the un .'
p13647
aS'and , our forces can be messengers of peace and hope , for example , by taking medical ships to remote island nations , and building relations with other militaries .'
p13648
aS'in conclusion , to transform our country , every institution must reform itself .'
p13649
aS'our nation will progress when we all move forward in step .'
p13650
aS'and , we expect you to lead from the front in expenditure reforms or in clean energy and energy efficiency .'
p13651
aS'as you reform , we will do our best to meet your needs and keep you prepared .'
p13652
aS'as our economy grows , we will be able to secure ourselves better .'
p13653
aS'in turn , india pursues its dreams in the comfort that it is secure in your hands .'
p13654
aS'our military leaders , this is a year of anniversaries of the end of two world wars and our 1965 conflict .'
p13655
aS'this is also a year when humanity has come together in the united nations to combat poverty and climate change .'
p13656
aS'in the memories of the great tragedies of the past and in our united efforts for a better world , we are reminded of the enduring human story of progress and peril .'
p13657
aS'and , of the responsibilities that men and women in uniform bear .'
p13658
aS'to serve the cause of peace .'
p13659
aS'to become the sentinels of progress .'
p13660
aS'i know that our forces live by that creed .'
p13661
aS'for our nation , for our friends , and our world .'
p13662
aS'and , you will help india rise to its promise and its place in the world .'
p13663
aS'thank you .'

p13670
aS'and , in this century , the great afghan people have waged an epic struggle of courage and resolve to shape their future with vote and debate , not gun and violence .'
p13671

p13680
aS'and , today , i am humbled and honoured to join president ghani and all the members of the afghan parliament to dedicate this new abode of democracy to the afghan nation .'
p13681
aS'we could not have chosen a more special day than the birthday of one of the tallest leaders of our time , former prime minister and bharat ratna shri atal bihari vajpayeeji .'
p13682
aS'eleven years ago , he dreamt of this project in partnership with karzai saheb .'
p13683
aS'and , we are deeply touched that you have chosen to name one of the wings in this building the atal block .'
p13684
aS'this parliament house brings together our two nations through the vision of our leaders , the labour of our people and the stones of our lands .'
p13685
aS'and , the atal block unites us in spirit , because atal means hero in pashto and in hindi it means to be firm .'
p13686
aS'it captures the spirit of afghanistan and of our friendship .'
p13687
aS'this parliament complex is a small tribute to your progress as a nation and a democracy .'
p13688
aS'and , it will stand as an enduring symbol of the ties of emotions and values , of affection and aspirations that bind us in a special relationship .'

p13692
aS'there were times we saw wars .'

aS'we owe to ancient afghanistan the gift of one of the great characters of mahabharata , gandhari .'
p13696
aS'in the achievements of mauryan empire or shershah suri , we see connectivity that we now aspire to rebuild .'
p13697
aS'the words of poet ahmed shah durrani may have expressed the longing of an afghan king in delhi , i forget the throne of delhi , when i remember the mountain tops of my afghan land .'
p13698
aS'but , in the heart of every indian and afghan , there is boundless love for each other .'
p13699
aS'we love each others culture and cinema , music and poetry , food and festivals .'
p13700
aS'and , now we admire each others cricket .'

aS'we are delighted that the afghan national cricket team has found its home ground near delhi and is practicing for next years world cup .'
p13702
aS'and , i congratulatethe afghan under 19 team that just beat zimbabwe in its first home series .'
p13703
aS'we are just as proud that afghans see india as a natural destination for education , health or a family home .'
p13704
aS'indians remember the support of afghans for our freedom struggle ; the contribution of khan abdul gaffar khan , revered as frontier gandhi ; and , the important footnote of that history , when , exactly hundred years ago , the first indian government-in-exile was formed in kabul by maharaja mahendra pratap and maulana barkatullah .'
p13705
aS'king amanullah once told the maharaja that so long as india was not free , afghanistan was not free in the right sense .'
p13706
aS'honourable members , this is the spirit of brotherhood between us .'
p13707
aS'and , when you began a new journey in a new century , we were proud to stand with you and walk with you .'
p13708
aS'our partnership has helped rural communities get schools , minor irrigation , health centres , welfare for children and opportunities for women .'
p13709
aS'together , we have built roads that have brought regions closer ; power transmission lines and power stations that light up afghan homes ; satellite links that bring education , medical advice and communication to afghan people .'
p13710
aS'and , we are helping the security forces become more mobile .'
p13711
aS'the institutions we are establishing together are helping rebuild agriculture and mining in afghanistan , and make advanced medical care available in kabul .'

p13722
aS'to indian diplomats , officers , engineers and doctors , who serve here with pride , to the families of our indian martyrs , i express the gratitude of indians and afghans .'
p13723
aS'there are some who did not want us to be here .'
p13724
aS'there were those who saw sinister designs in our presence here .'
p13725
aS'there are others who were uneasy at the strength of our partnership .'
p13726
aS'some even tried to discourage us .'
p13727
aS'but , we are here because you have faith in us .'
p13728
aS'you never doubted the sincerity of our commitment and the strength of our friendship .'
p13729
aS'and , you have seen the fruits of our partnership .'
p13730
aS'you have judged us by what you see , not what others tell you , including about the mysterious indian consulates .'
p13731
aS'you know that india is here to contribute not to compete ; to lay the foundations of future , not light the flame of conflict ; to rebuild lives , not destroy a nation .'
p13732
aS'you know , as we do , that indians and afghans have always stood for each other , never against another .'
p13733
aS'you have been at the crossroads of history .'
p13734
aS'and , your history tells us that you will never let yourself become a theatre of competition ; or serve the designs of others .'
p13735
aS'for you live by the creed extolled by poet kushal khan khattak that nations honor and nations fame on life they have a prior claim .'
p13736

p13741
aS'when afghanistan becomes a haven of peace and a hub for the flow of ideas , commerce , energy and investments in the region , we will all prosper together .'
p13742
aS'that is why we are working to improve your connectivity by land and sea , including through chahbahar in iran .'
p13743
aS'that is why i hope that pakistan will become a bridge between south asia and afghanistan and beyond .'
p13744
aS'i hope that the day will come soon when energy from central asia will power prosperity in our region ; when a kabuliwala can once again come across easily to win indian hearts ; when we in india can relish the wonderful fruits of afghanistan ; when afghans do not have to pay an enormous price to buy their favourite products from india .'
p13745
aS'for this has always been the course of this regions history .'
p13746
aS'and , it must be the path to its future .'
p13747
aS'but , brave and tireless as the afghans are in defending their nations , afghanistan will succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the border ; when nurseries and sanctuaries of terrorism are shut ; and , their patrons are no longer in business .'
p13748
aS'terror and violence can not be the instrument to shape afghanistans future or dictate the choices afghans make.'
p13749
ag1044
aS'for , the fire that is lit in afghanistan , can never be contained , within these boundaries .'
p13750
aS'afghans have the wisdom to seek peace with neighbours , but also the courage to defend their freedom .'
p13751
aS'and , afghans of all persuasions must have the right to seek peace among themselves .'
p13752
aS'too much blood has flown down kabul river .'
p13753
aS'too many tragedies have darkened the mountain slopes .'
p13754
aS'too many dreams have burnt in the fire of a senseless conflict .'
p13755
aS'you can be pushtoons , uzbeks , tajiks , hazaras .'
p13756
aS'you can be muslims , hindus and sikhs .'
p13757
aS'but , you are proud afghans who can come together as one nation and one people .'
p13758
aS'you may have fought in the name of religion ; or in the cause of identity .'
p13759
aS'but , it is now time for afghans to come together in peace .'
p13760
aS'as a wise afghan said , a tree with a bitter seed , fed with butter and sugar , will still bear a bitter fruit .'
p13761
aS'you have a glorious tradition of pluralism and respect for diversity and beliefs .'
p13762
aS'those waging war from outside must seek a path to this building and this hall .'
p13763
aS'those seeking territory through gun must seek power through ballot .'
p13764
aS'those who have destroyed homes must now rebuild their nation .'
p13765
aS'for , this is your land and these are your people .'
p13766
aS'and , it must be on your terms , on your genius , through your own process and your own spirit of brotherhood .'
p13767
aS'not driven by the calculations or ambitions of others .'
p13768
aS'and , the future you build in peace and through dialogue must preserve the hard-won progress of the last decade and half .'
p13769
aS'it must have a place for every afghan .'
p13770
aS'it must have space for everyones aspiration .'
p13771
aS'and , it must be a nation , where every citizen is secure of her rights and confident about her future .'
p13772
aS'and , as afghans take responsibility for their future , the world must stand with them in solidarity and support .'
p13773
aS'we must do that for the soldier from a foreign land who laid down his life in an afghan village that he had never heard of and for a people he had never known ; and , for the enormous sacrifices that afghans have made for a life that others take for granted .'
p13774
aS'we must support afghanistan without time lines because the new clouds of extremism and terrorism are rising , even as the old ones continue to darken our skies ; and , because afghans are not only fighting for their future , but are standing up for all of us and a safer world .'
p13775
aS'the world will be a better place when we can experience the real wealth of afghan people in their diversity and rich heritage .'
p13776
aS'it is time for all afghans , everyone in the region and the rest of the world to come together .'
p13777
aS'the sacrifices must not go in vain .'
p13778
aS'the flame of hope should not die .'
p13779
aS'no girl that steps into the world should slip into darkness of denied opportunities .'
p13780
aS'no son should face the choice of gun or refuge in a distant land .'
p13781
aS'no mother should fear bringing a child into this world .'
p13782
aS'no leader should lose a brother because he spoke for afghan freedom to choose friends .'
p13783
aS'no one kneeling in prayer in a mosque should be killed in the name of religion .'
p13784
aS'no elder should look back on his youth wasted in conflict , and see the same future for his grandchild .'
p13785
aS'every youth in afghanistan should see a future in which it stands for information technology , not international terrorism .'
p13786
aS'for , the promise and the opportunities of the 21st century belong to afghan youth as much as anyone else in the world .'
p13787
aS'for india , this is a deeply held commitment .'
p13788
aS'your suffering is our pain .'
p13789
aS'your dreams are our duty .'

aS'president putin and i have a high degree of convergence in our positions on global issues and a strong commitment to deepen our international cooperation .'
p13837
aS'we have strong collaboration in the united nations .'
p13838
aS'our membership of brics , east asia summit , g20 and now shanghai cooperation organisation gives our partnership a global character .'
p13839

p13840

p13868
aS'a large number of foreign and domestic tourists travel across the country .'
p13869
aS'people also travel to celebrate christmas vacations .'
p13870
aS'he says most of the facilities related to tourism are catered to but special emphasis should be laid on cleanliness at all places which are tourist destinations or famed tourist places , religious destinations or stay overs .'
p13871
aS'indias image will be enhanced if the tourist destinations are clean .'
p13872
aS'i appreciate the views of ganesh jee and convey this message to the people of our country .'
p13873
aS'we say , atithi devo bhava and just imagine how we strive to keep our homes neat and clean when a guest is due to arrive .'
p13874
aS'in a similar manner , the onus is on us to maintain our tourist destinations and pilgrim tourism sites neat and clean .'
p13875
aS'i am very happy that a lot of news stories related to cleanliness keep appearing in the media space .'
p13876
aS'from day one , i have thanked our media friends since they have brought many such small and good success stories before the people .'
p13877
aS'i have come across a nice story in the newspaper and i would like to narrate it with the fellow citizens .'
p13878
aS'dileep singh malviya is an elderly artisan from bhojpura village in sehore district of madhya pradesh .'
p13879
aS'he is a mason by profession to earn his livelihood .'
p13880
aS'he did something so different that the newspapers printed his story .'
p13881
aS'and when it came to my notice , i wanted to share this story with you .'
p13882
aS'hailing from a small village , dileep singh malviya decided that if anyone provides materials for toilet in the village , he will render his labour services free of cost .'
p13883
aS'and hats off to him , he has constructed 100 toilets in bhojpura village so far taking it as a divine cause and providing his labour services without charging a penny .'
p13884
aS'my heartfelt congratulations to dileep singh malviya for his earnest efforts .'
p13885
aS'sometimes we hear disappointing news about our nation .'
p13886
aS'but there are thousands of people like dileep singh who are doing something good for the nation on their own .'
p13887
aS'this is the power of the nation .'
p13888
aS'this is the hope of the nation and these are the things which carry the nation forward and it is natural that we applaud dileep singh and his efforts in mann ki baat .'
p13889
aS'due to tireless efforts of many people the nation is making rapid progress .'
p13890
aS'125 crores indians are not only marching together but they are taking the country forward too .'
p13891
aS'better education , best talent and new opportunities of employment are being created .'
p13892
aS'be it providing insurance cover to citizens or providing them banking facilities , be it the ease of doing business in the world horizon or making facilities available for new businesses , we have done it all .'
p13893
aS'people from normal backgrounds who could not step inside banks can now avail loan facilities from the mudra yojana .'
p13894
aS'every indian is proud to know how the world is accepting and getting attracted towards yoga .'
p13895
aS'when the world celebrated international yoga diwas and the entire world got associated with it , we became proud of our country .'
p13896
aS'such emotions arise when we see the enormity of our nation .'
p13897
aS'no one can forget the story of krishna and yashoda where he opened his mouth and the mother was able to see the entire universe , and then only his power could be realized .'
p13898
aS'the yoga incident was a similar reminder .'
p13899
aS'the concept of cleanliness is being echoed in every household .'
p13900
aS'the participation of citizens is also increasing .'
p13901
aS'many villages receive an electric pole after so many years of independence .'
p13902
aS'those of us who live in cities and are so accustomed to using electricity that we dont realize the extent of happiness and excitement when darkness is removed from our lives .'
p13903
aS'the power department of the state and indian government were functional earlier as well but from the day 1000 day target to provide electricity to every village has been set , we get news everyday that power supply is available in some or the other village and the happiness of the inhabitants knows no bounds .'
p13904
aS'the media has not discussed this topic .'
p13905
aS'but i am sure that media will definitely reach such villages and will inform the nation about the happiness and excitement of the people there .'
p13906
aS'the biggest achievement of this task is that the government officials involved in this task will have immense satisfaction that they have done something which will bring about such a big change in the lives of the people and the village itself .'
p13907
aS'be it the farmers , poor , young or women , should such things reach them or not ?'
p13908
aS'such news should reach them not to highlight any governments achievement , but to make them aware of their rights .'
p13909
aS'they should not let go if it is their right .'
p13910
aS'people should get information in order to avail their rights .'
p13911
aS'we should all make efforts that right information , good information and information useful to the common man should reach as many people as possible .'
p13912
aS'this is also a kind of service .'
p13913
aS'i too have tried to do this work from my end .'
p13914
aS'i can not do everything alone by myself .'
p13915
aS'but if i am saying then i should at least do something .'
p13916
aS'even a common man can download the narendra modi app and get connected to me .'
p13917
aS'and i can share these small things with you through the app .'
p13918
aS'and it is a matter of happiness for me that people share all the things with me .'
p13919
aS'you too get connected with this initiative , we have to reach 125 crore indians .'
p13920
aS'how will i reach without your help ?'
p13921
aS'come , let us collectively do such things of interest for the common man in their language and inspire them to avail things which are their rights .'
p13922
aS'my dear young friends , i had some preliminary discussions about start-up india , stand-up india in my speech on 15th august from the red fort .'
p13923
aS'after that all government departments started discussing it .'
p13924
aS'can india become a start-up capital ?'
p13925
aS'can our states work together for new start-ups for youth , and encourage innovations with start-ups , be it in the manufacturing sector , service sector or agriculture .'
p13926
aS'everything should be new , new ways and new thinking - after all the world does not move ahead without innovation .'
p13927
aS'start-up india , stand-up india brings in a huge opportunity for the young generation .'
p13928
aS'my dear young friends , the government will launch the entire action plan for start-up india , stand-up india on 16th january .'
p13929
aS'what it will be , how it will be and why it will be ?'
p13930
aS'you will be presented with a structure .'
p13931
aS'in this program all the iits , iims , central universities , nits , wherever there is young generation , they will be brought together via live connectivity .'
p13932
aS'there is an established thinking regarding the start-ups that they are meant only for the digital world or the it profession .'
p13933
aS'this is not true at all ; we need to modify it according to the needs of india .'
p13934
aS'for example , when a poor person works somewhere as a labourer and there is a lot of physical effort involved but if a young man innovates something which can reduce the physical effort and help the labourer- i will call it as a start-up .'
p13935
aS'i will ask the bank to help such an individual and i will tell him to move ahead with courage .'
p13936
aS'you will get the market .'
p13937
aS'similarly is the intellectual wealth limited to a few selected cities or what ?'
p13938
aS'this thinking is wrong .'
p13939
aS'the indian youth all over the country has talent , all they need is opportunities .'
p13940
aS'this start-up india , stand-up india should not be limited to a few cities only .'
p13941
aS'it should spread to every corner of india .'
p13942
aS'and i will request the state governments to take this forward .'
p13943
aS'i will definitely interact with you on 16th january and will discuss this in detail .'
p13944
aS'your suggestions are always welcome .'
p13945
aS'dear young friends , 12th january is the birth anniversary of swami vivekananda .'
p13946
aS'there are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him .'
p13947
aS'since 1995 , 12th january , the birth anniversary of vivekananda is celebrated as the national youth festival .'
p13948
aS'this year it will be organized from 12-16th january in raipur district of chhattisgarh .'
p13949
aS'this is a theme based event and i have got the information that this time they have a very good theme and that is indian youth on development skill and harmony .'
p13950
aS'i have been told that 10,000 young people will gather from all over india .'
p13951
aS'a mini-india will be created there .'
p13952
aS'they will share dreams together .'
p13953
aS'a feeling of determination will be experienced .'
p13954
aS'can you give me suggestions regarding this youth festival ?'
p13955
aS'i would request the youth to send me their suggestions directly on the narendra modi app .'
p13956
aS'i want to gain an insight into your understanding .'
p13957
aS'and that it gets reflected in the youth festival , for that i will give the government reasonable suggestions and information .'
p13958
aS'so i will wait dear friends for your suggestions on the youth festival on the narendra modi app .'
p13959
aS'dilip chauhan , from ahmedabad , gujarat , who is a visually challenged teacher , celebrated accessible india day in his school .'
p13960
aS'he called me up to express his feelings : sir , we celebrated accessible india campaign in our school .'
p13961
aS'i am a visually challenged teacher and i addressed 2000 children on the issue of disability and how we can spread awareness and help differently-abled people .'
p13962
aS'and the students response was fantastic , we enjoyed in the school and the students were inspired and motivated to help the disabled people in the society .'
p13963
aS'i think it was a great initiative by you .'
p13964
aS'dilip ji , thank you very much .'
p13965
aS'you are yourself working in this field .'
p13966
aS'you understand everything and you must have faced a lot of difficulties too .'
p13967
aS'sometimes when we meet someone with different ability in the society then a lot of things come to our mind .'
p13968
aS'we express our perception of him based on our thinking .'
p13969
aS'there are some people who lose a limb or body part in an accident .'
p13970
aS'some people are born with some defects .'
p13971
aS'and for these people different terms are used and a lot of thought goes on behind the usage of these terms .'
p13972
aS'all the time people feel that this kind of identification does not sound nice and respectable .'
p13973
aS'at some point we heard handicapped , then it was disabled and somewhere it is specially-abled , so many terms have been used .'
p13974
aS'it is true that words have their own significance .'
p13975
aS'this year when the government of india started the sugamya india programme , i was supposed to attend it , but could not make it , because of severe floods in chennai and other areas of tamil nadu .'
p13976
aS'however , since i had to attend that program some thoughts kept coming in my mind .'
p13977
aS'that time , i thought that we call or know those people as handicapped since they are lacking in some ways in terms of their body structure or whose organs do not function properly .'
p13978
aS'however , at times when we interact with them , we realize that we see only the deficits with our eyes but god has certainly bestowed them with some extra powers .'
p13979
aS'god has bestowed upon them some different power which we can not see with our eyes , but it is only when we see them working do we realize their talent .'
p13980
aS'we think o great !'
p13981
aS'look how he works .'
p13982
aS'so i thought that upon looking at them with our eyes we feel that they are handicapped , but experiences tell us that they have some extra power .'
p13983
aS'so i thought why not use the term divyang instead of viklang in our country .'
p13984
aS'they are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity , where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have .'
p13985
aS'i like this term .'
p13986
aS'my dear countrymen can we make it a habit to use the word divyang and make it popular .'
p13987
aS'i hope that you will take this forward .'
p13988
aS'that day we started the sugamya bharat campaign .'
p13989
aS'under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the divyang people .'
p13990
aS'be it schools , hospitals , government offices , bus depots , railway stations , everywhere ramps , accessible parking , accessible lifts , braille , many amenities will be made available .'
p13991
aS'to make things sugamya - we need innovation , we need technology , we need systems and we also need empathy from people .'
p13992
aS'we have taken the initiative .'
p13993
aS'we are receiving public participation too .'
p13994
aS'people like it .'
p13995
aS'you too can join in the manner you deem fit .'
p13996
aS'my dear countrymen , the government schemes will continue exist and run , but it is necessary that these schemes always remain operational .'
p13997
aS'the schemes should be operational till the last mile individual has benefitted from them .'
p13998
aS'they should not have a dead existence in government files .'
p13999
aS'after all , these schemes are meant for common man , the poor people .'
p14000
aS'in the past few days the government has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of schemes reach out to the rightful owners .'
p14001
aS'in our country , we give subsidy for the gas cylinders .'
p14002
aS'crores of rupees were spent on it but we did not know if it reached the right people or not , if this subsidy reached people on time or not ?'
p14003
aS'the government has made some changes in the scheme .'
p14004
aS'the government undertook the largest direct benefit transfer scheme to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of jan dhan account or aadhar card etc .'
p14005
aS'i am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in guinness book of world records as the largest direct benefit transfer scheme which has been implemented successfully .'
p14006
aS'this scheme is known as pahal and this experiment has been very successful .'
p14007
aS'till november end , around 15 crore lpg customers have become its beneficiaries .'
p14008
aS'the government money is being directly transferred to the accounts of 15 crore beneficiaries .'
p14009
aS'no middlemen nor any recommendation , nor any possibility of corruption .'
p14010
aS'on one hand was the aadhar card scheme , and on the other was the jan dhan account .'
p14011
aS'thirdly the state and indian government compiled the lists of beneficiaries .'
p14012
aS'that was connected to account and aadhar .'
p14013
aS'this work is still in progress .'
p14014
aS'nowadays , even the mnrega scheme , which provides employment opportunities in villages , is being connected to it .'
p14015
aS'there were lots of complaints about this scheme .'
p14016
aS'in many places the wages of the labourers is now being directly transferred into their accounts .'
p14017
aS'there were complaints about student scholarships too ; they too are being transferred into their accounts .'
p14018
aS'this has been started and will be gradually taken forward .'
p14019
aS'till now around 40,000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes .'
p14020
aS'according to my rough estimate , around 35-40 schemes are now under direct benefit transfer .'
p14021
aS'my dear countrymen , 26th january is the golden moment in the life of indian democracy .'
p14022
aS'this is a beautiful co-incidence that baba saheb ambedkar , the maker of the indian constitution , his 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated this year .'
p14023
aS'we organized a two day special discussion on the constitution and it was a very good experience .'
p14024
aS'all the parties and all the members deliberated on the sanctity of the constitution , its importance to understand the true interpretation of the constitution .'
p14025
aS'it was an excellent discussion .'
p14026
aS'we should take this thing forward .'
p14027
aS'can republic day be an opportunity to connect the masses with the system ?'
p14028
aS'our constitution grants us several rights and there are many discussions on it and it should be so and it is equally important .'
p14029
aS'but constitution equally emphasizes on duty also .'
p14030
aS'but it is seen that duties are hardly discussed .'
p14031
aS'at the most , whenever there are elections , then we see advertisement all around us , they write on the walls and hoardings are put to tell that to vote is our sacred duty .'
p14032
aS'there is a lot of talk about duties during elections , but why not discuss our duties in general life too .'
p14033
aS'this year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedkar then can we make 26th january a medium to organize debates , poetry , slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools , colleges , villages , cities and various organizations and societies .'
p14034
aS'if 125 crore indians take dutiful steps one after the other , they can make history .'
p14035
aS'but at least lets start with discussions .'
p14036
aS'i have an idea send me an essay or poem before 26th january about duty in hindi or english or your native language .'
p14037
aS'can you send me ?'
p14038
aS'i want to know your views .'
p14039
aS'send them on my portal my gov .'
p14040
aS'i would like to know what my young generation thinks about their duties .'
p14041
aS'i want to give a small suggestion .'
p14042
aS'on 26th january we celebrate republic day .'
p14043
aS'can we citizens and school and college students take up the initiative of cleaning the statue of any great men installed in our city , of cleaning the premises , we can do best of cleanliness and best of decoration on the occasion of 26th january .'
p14044
aS'and i am not saying this on government lines .'
p14045
aS'we become so emotional about getting the statues of great men erected but become equally complacent when it comes to maintaining them .'
p14046
aS'as a society , as a nation can we make it a natural tendency to respect the statues of our great men ?'
p14047
aS'on this 26th january let us make an effort that we will respect such great men and keep the premises clean .'
p14048
aS'but this should be done by the citizens willfully .'
p14049
aS'dear countrymen , greetings to you for a happy new year 2016 .'
p14050
aS'thank you very much !'

p14063
aS'for our confidence about the future of india comes from our faith in you .'
p14064
aS'it is a huge honour and privilege to address the 103rd science congress in the centenary year of the university of mysore .'
p14065
aS'some of the tallest leaders of india have passed through the doors of this respected institution .'
p14066
aS'the great philosopher and indias second president dr.'
p14067
aS'radhakrishnan and bharat ratna professor cnr rao are among them .'
p14068
aS'the history of the science congress and the university of mysore began around the same time .'
p14069
aS'it was the time of a new awakening in india .'
p14070
aS'it sought not just freedom , but also human advancement in india .'
p14071
aS'it wanted not just an independent india , but an india that could stand independently on the strength of its human resources , scientific capabilities and industrial development .'
p14072
aS'this university is a testimony to the vision of a great generation of indians .'
p14073
aS'now , we have launched yet another revolution of empowerment and opportunities in india .'
p14074
aS'and , we are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development .'
p14075
aS'the world has progressed because of human instinct to enquire and explore for knowledge but also to address human challenges .'
p14076
aS'no one reflected this spirit more than late president dr.'
p14077
aS'apj abdul kalam .'
p14078
aS'his was a life of outstanding scientific achievements ; and , his was a heart of boundless compassion and concern for humanity .'
p14079
aS'for him , the highest purpose of science was the transformation of the life of the weak , the under-privileged and the youth .'
p14080
aS'and , his lifes mission was a self-reliant and a self-assured india that was strong and cared for its people .'
p14081
aS'your theme for this congress is a fitting tribute to his vision .'
p14082
aS'and , it is leaders like professor rao and president kalam , and scientists like you , who have placed india at the forefront of science and technology in many areas .'
p14083
aS'our success spans from the core of the tiny atom to the vast frontier of space .'
p14084
aS'we have enhanced food and health security ; and , we have given hope for a better life to others in the world .'
p14085
aS'as we increase the level of our ambition for our people , we will also have to increase the scale of our efforts .'
p14086
aS'so , for me , good governance is not just about policy and decision making , transparency and accountability .'
p14087
aS'it is also about integrating science and technology into the choices we make and the strategies we pursue .'
p14088
aS'our digital networks are expanding the quality and reach of public services and social benefits for the poor .'
p14089
aS'and , in the first ever national space conference , we identified 170 applications that touch almost every aspect of governance , development and conservation .'
p14090
aS'we are launching startup india that will encourage innovation and enterprise .'
p14091
aS'we are creating technology incubators in academic institutions .'
p14092
aS'and , i have asked for a framework of scientific audit for scientific departments and institutions in the government .'
p14093
aS'it is with the same spirit of cooperative federalism that is shaping centre-state relations in every area , that i am encouraging greater scientific collaboration between central and state institutions and agencies .'
p14094
aS'we will also try to increase the level of resources for science , and deploy them in accordance with our strategic priorities , we will make it easier to do science and research in india , improve science administration , and expand the supply and improve the quality of science education and research in india .'
p14095
aS'at the same time , innovation must not be just the goal of our science .'
p14096
aS'innovation must also drive the scientific process .'
p14097
aS'frugal innovation and crowd sourcing are examples of efficient and effective scientific enterprise .'
p14098
aS'and , innovation in approach is not just the obligation of the government , but also the responsibility of the private sector and the academia .'
p14099
aS'in a world of resource constraints and competing claims , we have to be smart in defining our priorities .'
p14100
aS'and , it is especially important in india , where challenges are many and the scale is enormous from health and hunger to energy and economy .'
p14101
aS'distinguished delegates , today , i wanted to speak to you about one of the biggest challenges for the world , and one that dominated global attention last year to define a path to a more prosperous future for our world and a more sustainable future for our planet .'
p14102
aS'in 2015 , the world took two historic steps .'
p14103
aS'last september , the united nations adopted the development agenda for 2030 .'
p14104
aS'it places elimination of poverty by the end of 2030 and economic development at the top of our priorities , but with equal emphasis on sustainability of our environment and our habitats .'
p14105
aS'and , last november in paris , the world came together to craft a historic agreement to change the course of our planet .'
p14106
aS'but , we achieved something else that is equally important .'
p14107
aS'we succeeded in bringing innovation and technology to the heart of the climate change discourse .'
p14108
aS'we were consistent in our message that it is not enough to speak of targets and restraints .'
p14109
aS'it is essential to find solutions that help us transition easily to a future of clean energy .'
p14110
aS'i also said in paris that innovation is important not just for combating climate change , but also for climate justice .'
p14111
aS'for , the developed world must leave enough of the little carbon space left for developing countries to grow .'
p14112
aS'for this , we need research and innovation to make clean energy technology available , accessible and affordable for all .'
p14113
aS'at paris , president hollande , president obama and i joined a number of global leaders for an innovation summit .'
p14114
aS'we pledged to double national investments in innovation ; and , build a global partnership that combines the responsibility of governments with the innovative capacity of the private sector .'
p14115
aS'i also suggested an international network of 30-40 universities and labs focusing for next ten years on transforming the way we produce , distribute and consume energy .'
p14116
aS'we will also pursue this in g 20 .'
p14117
aS'we need innovation to make renewable energy much cheaper ; more reliable ; and , easier to connect to transmission grids .'
p14118
aS'this is especially critical for india to achieve our target of adding 175 gw of renewable generation by 2022 .'
p14119
aS'we must also make fossil fuel like coal cleaner and more efficient .'
p14120
aS'and , we should tap newer sources of renewable energy , from ocean waves to geothermal energy .'
p14121
aS'at a time when energy sources that fueled the industrial age have put our planet in peril , and , as the developing world now seeks to lift billions of people into prosperity , the world must turn to sun to power our future .'
p14122
aS'so , at paris , india launched an international solar alliance to forge a partnership between solar-rich countries .'
p14123
aS'we need science and technology not just to make clean energy an integral part of our existence , but also to combat the impact of climate change on our lives .'
p14124
aS'we have to develop climate resilient agriculture .'
p14125
aS'we must understand the impact of climate change on our weather , biodiversity , glaciers , and oceans ; and , how to adjust to them .'
p14126
aS'we must strengthen our ability to forecast natural disasters .'
p14127
aS'distinguished delegates , we must also address the rising challenges of rapid urbanisation .'
p14128
aS'this will be critical for a sustainable world .'
p14129
aS'for the first time in human history , we are in an urban century .'
p14130
aS'by the middle of this century , two-thirds of the worlds population will live in cities .'
p14131
aS'a little less than 3.'
p14132
aS'0 billion people will join the existing 3.'
p14133
aS'5 billion urban dwellers .'
p14134
aS'and , 90 % of the increase will come from developing countries .'
p14135
aS'many urban clusters in asia will exceed the population of mid-sized countries elsewhere in the world .'
p14136
aS'more than 50 % of india will be living in urban habitats by 2050 .'
p14137
aS'and , by 2025 , india may already have more than 10 % of the global urban population .'
p14138
aS'studies suggest that nearly 40 % of the global urban population lives in informal settlements , or slums , where they face a range of health and nutritional challenges .'
p14139
aS'cities are the major engines of economic growth , employment opportunities and prosperity .'
p14140
aS'but , cities account for more than two-thirds of global energy demand and result in up to 80 % of global greenhouse gas emission .'
p14141
aS'that is why i have placed so much emphasis on smart cities .'
p14142
aS'it is not just about cities that are networked to become more efficient , safe and better in delivery of services .'
p14143
aS'it is also a vision of sustainable cities that are both locomotives of our economies and havens of healthy living .'
p14144
aS'we will need sound policies to achieve our goals , but we will rely on science and technology to provide creative solutions .'
p14145
aS'we must develop better scientific tools to improve city planning with sensitivity to local ecology and heritage ; and , reduce the demand for transportation , improve mobility and reduce congestion .'
p14146
aS'much of our urban infrastructure is yet to be built .'
p14147
aS'we must maximise the use of local material with scientific improvements ; and , and make buildings more energy efficient .'
p14148
aS'we have to find affordable and practical solutions for solid waste management ; converting waste into building material and energy ; and , recycling waste water .'
p14149
aS'urban agriculture and ecology should get more attention .'
p14150
aS'and , our children must breathe cleaner city air .'
p14151
aS'and , we need solutions that are comprehensive and rooted in science and innovation .'
p14152
aS'we need your inputs to make our cities more immune to the consequences of natural disasters and our homes more resilient .'
p14153
aS'this will also mean making retrofit of buildings affordable .'
p14154
aS'distinguished delegates , a sustainable future for this planet will depend not only on what we do on land , but also on how we treat our oceans .'
p14155
aS'oceans occupy more than 70 % of our planet ; and , over 40 % of humanity and 60 % of the worlds largest cities are found within 100 kilometers of the coast .'
p14156
aS'we are at the cusp of a new era , where oceans will become important drivers of our economies .'
p14157
aS'their sustainable use can bring prosperity ; and , give us clean energy , new medicines and food security beyond just fisheries .'
p14158
aS'that is why i refer to the small island states as large ocean states .'
p14159
aS'ocean is critical to indias future , too , with over 1300 islands , a 7500 km coastline and 2.'
p14160
aS'4 million square kilometers of exclusive economic zone .'
p14161
aS'that is why , in the past year , we have increased our focus on ocean or blue economy .'
p14162
aS'we will raise the level of our scientific efforts in marine science .'
p14163
aS'we will set up an advanced centre of research in marine biology and biotechnology and establish a network of coastal and island research stations in india and abroad .'
p14164
aS'we have entered into agreements on marine science and ocean economy with several countries .'
p14165
aS'we will also hold an international conference on ocean economy and pacific island countries in new delhi in 2016 .'
p14166
aS'distinguished delegates , rivers have played as important a role in human history as oceans .'
p14167
aS'civilisations have been nurtured by rivers .'
p14168
aS'and , rivers will remain critical for our future .'
p14169
aS'so , revival of rivers is an essential part of my commitment for a cleaner and healthier future for our society , economic opportunities for our people , and renewal of our heritage .'
p14170
aS'we need regulations , policy , investments and management to achieve our objective .'
p14171
aS'but , we will succeed only when we integrate technology , engineering and innovation into our efforts , not just to clean our rivers now but to keep them healthy in the future as well .'
p14172
aS'for this , we also need scientific understanding of the impact of urbanisation , farming , industrialisation and groundwater use and contamination on the river eco-system .'
p14173
aS'river is the soul of nature .'
p14174
aS'their renewal must be an element of a larger effort to sustain nature .'
p14175
aS'in india , we see humanity as part of nature , not outside or superior to it , and divinity manifested in natures diverse forms .'
p14176
aS'so , conservation is rooted in the natural instincts of our culture and tradition , and in our commitment to the future .'
p14177
aS'india has a rich heritage of ecological knowledge .'
p14178
aS'we have scientific institutions and human resources to mount concerted national action on conservation of nature that is rooted firmly in scientific studies and methods .'
p14179
aS'distinguished delegates , and , if we wish to restore the harmony between human and nature , we must also harness the full potential of traditional knowledge .'
p14180
aS'societies across the world have developed this enormous wealth through wisdom gathered over the ages .'
p14181
aS'and , they hold the secrets to economic , efficient , and , environment friendly solutions to many of our problems .'
p14182
aS'but , today they are at risk of extinction in our globalised world .'
p14183
aS'like traditional knowledge , science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of nature .'
p14184
aS'so , we must recognize that science , as we see it , does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world .'
p14185
aS'and , we must bridge the distance between traditional knowledge and modern science , so that we can craft local and more sustainable solutions for our challenges .'
p14186
aS'so , in agriculture , even as we seek to make our farms yield more , reduce the intensity of our water use , or increase the nutrient content of our farm output , we should also integrate traditional techniques , local practices and organic farming to make our agriculture less resource intensive and more resilient .'
p14187
aS'and , in the area of health , modern medicines have transformed healthcare .'
p14188
aS'but , we must also use scientific techniques and methods to delve deeper into traditional medicines and practices like yoga for more holistic lifestyle and change our paradigm from treatment to wellness .'
p14189
aS'this is especially important in dealing with growing challenge of lifestyle diseases that take a huge toll in terms of human lives and economic costs .'
p14190
aS'distinguished delegates , as a nation we still inhabit many worlds .'
p14191
aS'we are at the global frontiers of achievements in science and technology .'
p14192
aS'we also see the uncertainty and despair of many living at the edge of existence , looking for a life of hope , opportunity , dignity and equity .'
p14193
aS'we must meet these aspirations at a speed and on a scale that is rare in human history .'
p14194
aS'and , from the richness of our tradition , the consciousness of our age and the strength of our commitment to our world , we must choose the most sustainable path possible .'
p14195
aS'the success of one-sixth of humanity will also mean a more prosperous and a sustainable future for the world .'
p14196
aS'we can only do this with your leadership and support .'
p14197
aS'we will realise it when , in the words of vikram sarabhai , we encourage scientists to interest themselves in problems outside their fields of specialization .'
p14198
aS'and , the impact of science will be the most when scientists and technologists will keep the principles of what i call five es at the centre of their enquiry and engineering : economy when we find cost effective and efficient solutions environment when our carbon footprint is the lightest and the impact on the ecology is the least possible energy when our prosperity relies less on energy ; and the energy we use keeps our skies blue and our earth green .'
p14199
aS'empathy when our efforts are in tune with our culture , circumstances and social challenges .'
p14200
aS'equity when science advances inclusive development and improves the welfare of the weakest .'
p14201
aS'this year we mark a hundred years of a significant moment in the history of science , when albert einstein published in 1916 the foundation of the general theory of relativity .'
p14202
aS'today , we must recall the humanism that defined his thought : concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavours .'
p14203
aS'nothing can be a higher duty for us , whether we are in public life , or we are private citizens , and whether we are in business or explore science , than to leave the planet in a better state for our future generations .'
p14204
aS'let the different disciplines of science , technology and engineering unite behind this common purpose .'
p14205
aS'thank you .'
p14206
aa(lp14207
S'the prime minister , shri narendra modi , today inaugurated the international conference on frontiers in yoga research and its applications , at jigani , bengaluru .'
p14208
aS'he unveiled the foundation stone for a hospital of integrative medicine .'
p14209
aS'following is the text of the prime ministers inaugural address : governor of karnataka shri vajubhai vala , chief minister of karnataka shri siddaramaiah , my valued colleagues in the council of ministers , dr .'
p14210
aS'nagendra , dignitaries on the dais , esteemed guests from all over the world and yoga enthusiasts , it is a great pleasure and privilege to participate in the 21st international conference on frontiers in yoga research and its applications .'
p14211
aS'iam deeply grateful to vivekananda yoga anusandhan sansthan for organizing this conference .'
p14212
aS'vivekanandas vision was a synthesis of a deep reading of the indian and western thought , and drew its spirit from our ancient philosophy and knowledge .'
p14213
aS'he not only made a unique contribution to the spiritual revival of india , he also placed our timeless wisdom before the world .'
p14214
aS'he had a deep understanding of the beauty of human diversity and spoke passionately for unity in our world .'
p14215
aS'this is a particularly special year for the science of yoga .'
p14216
aS'on june 21 , more than a million people in 192 countries came together to celebrate the first international day of yoga .'
p14217
aS'the overwhelming global support is a mark of yogas growing international popularity .'
p14218
aS'it is also a symbol of the universal aspiration for health and well being .'
p14219
aS'it reflects the shared global desire for balance between human and mother nature ; and , peace and harmony between people and nations .'
p14220
aS'above all , it demonstrated once again the capacity of people from different cultures to reach beyond the familiar boundaries of their lives and unite in pursuit of a larger good .'
p14221
aS'it is this spirit of unity that demonstrates the timeless science of yoga .'
p14222
aS'and , it is this belief in the power of yoga and faith in humanity that i proposed this initiative in my inaugural address to the united nations general assembly in september 2014.'
p14223
aS'when it comes to a sustainable future for our world , a healthy habit and happier people , a change in our way of life that influences the choices we make as individuals , nations and global community is important .'
p14224
aS'this is a recognition that is dawning on the world .'
p14225
aS'and , across cultures and geography , people are increasingly taking to yoga to redefine their lives - to find oneness between their inner self and outer world ; between their existence and their environment .'
p14226
aS'the who fact sheet on the global burden of disease says that non-communicable diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide .'
p14227
aS'in 2008 , 80 percent of deaths due to these diseases were in developing countries , up from 40 percent in 1990.'
p14228
aS'by 2030 , low-income countries will have eight times more deaths attributed to ncds than high-income countries .'
p14229
aS'in india , cardiovascular diseases , cancers , chronic respiratory diseases , diabetes , and other non communicable diseases are estimated to account for 60 % of all deaths .'
p14230
aS'these diseases account for about 40 % of all hospital stays and roughly 35 % of all recorded outpatient visits .'
p14231
aS'we face the tragedy of productive lives cut short and families that must deal with untimely loss ; the huge toll on the economy ; and , the excessive burden on the over-stretched health system .'
p14232
aS'some studies have estimated that india stands to lose about 4.'
p14233
aS'58 trillion dollars before 2030 due to non communicable diseases and mental health conditions .'
p14234
aS'so , we must address the question of psychological state of our existence as much as we try to advance our physical and material life .'
p14235
aS'this is where the role of yoga is paramount .'
p14236
aS'across the world , there are moving stories of transformed lives and rekindled hopes due to yoga .'
p14237
aS'the prediction of shri aurobindo that indian yoga .'
p14238
ag1044
ag1044
aS'is potentially one of these dynamic elements of the future life of humanity is coming true .'
p14239
aS'this discipline was not originally considered or conceived as system of medicine .'
p14240
aS'but , because yoga is about aholistic lifestyle and the physical , mental , intellectual , emotional , moral and spiritual harmony , it has profound health benefits .'
p14241
aS'it fits well with the change in the way that world increasingly defines health .'
p14242
aS'we are no longer satisfied with just preventing and managing diseases .'
p14243
aS'people now demand promotion of wellness , which is a healthy balance of the mind , body and spirit .'
p14244
aS'we now increasingly hear voices calling for holistic treatment , which means dealing not just with the immediate ailment , but with the complete person , physically , psychologically , socially , and spiritually .'
p14245
aS'traditional indian systems are rooted in looking at human beings in totality .'
p14246
aS'they see the link between adhi or problems at the mind level and vyadhi or problems at the physical level .'
p14247
aS'they probe deeper causes , not just look at symptoms .'
p14248
aS'they treat the person , not just cure the disease .'
p14249
aS'they may at times take longer to take effect , but they tend to have deeper and longer impact .'
p14250
aS'and , they are without side effects .'
p14251
aS'as i argued at the science congress this morning , like traditional knowledge , science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of nature .'
p14252
aS'so , we must recognize that science , as we see it , does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world .'
p14253
aS'and , we must remember that the western system of thought , from hippocrates to percival to edison have expressed views on health that are not fundamentally different from the philosophy of the indian system .'
p14254
aS'so , along with the accumulated wisdom and experience gathered over the ages , we must also apply the techniques and methods of modern science to test and validate results , assure quality and explain benefits .'
p14255
aS'and , this is why we are placing emphasis on our efforts to increase awareness , acceptance and adoption of ayush system of medicine .'
p14256
aS'and , in doing so , we will create better wellness among people , rely more on local resources and reduce healthcare costs .'
p14257
aS'we will also reduce the social and economic costs to our society and promote a more environment friendly healthcare system .'
p14258
aS'i am not here to advocate the supremacy of one system over another .'
p14259
aS'i believe that humanity is wealthier for its diversity .'
p14260
aS'civilisations , cultures and countries have enriched each other by sharing their knowledge and wisdom .'
p14261
aS'and , we can progress more by learning from each other .'
p14262
aS'it is in this spirit that swami vivekananda called for combining the best from the east and the west .'
p14263
aS'so , it must be in the area of healthcare .'
p14264
aS'my vision for healthcare is an integrated system that understands and builds on the best and most effective of different traditions .'
p14265
aS'this is why i deeply appreciate your effort to integrate yoga , ayurveda , naturopathy , unani , siddha , homeopathy and modern medicine by bringing prominent researchers and doctors on one platform .'
p14266
aS'your focus on four major non-communicable diseases - diabetes , cancer , psychiatric disorders , hypertension and cardiovascular diseases is appreciable .'
p14267
aS'it addresses issues that are very close to my heart .'
p14268
aS'modern systems of medicine have transformed healthcare ; screening , detection and diagnosis of diseases .'
p14269
aS'use of technology has reduced barriers to accessing health care , and improved our understanding of disease patterns .'
p14270
aS'breakthroughs in medicines and vaccines have helped conquer and contain many diseases .'
p14271
aS'but , as our understanding of its limitation and its side effects have grown , as we have experienced the growing costs of modern medicine systems , we have begun to look beyond to traditional systems , not just in india , but in other countries as well .'
p14272
aS'their popularity is growing .'
p14273
aS'yoga is now a global heritage .'
p14274
aS'and , the world is embracing traditional indian medicine with great enthusiasm .'
p14275
aS'so , we look to you at this conference to define the path forward in the service of humanity .'
p14276
aS'i hope that health professionals , policymakers , government organizations and industry will bridge the distance between the various forms of medical systems .'
p14277
aS'i hope that you will to integrate yoga and traditional indian medicine more closely into our healthcare system and make wellness a part of life for all in india and rest of the world .'
p14278
aS'you will contribute not only to healthier and happier life for people , but also to a more prosperous and peaceful world , and a more sustainable future for our planet .'
p14279
aS'thank you .'

S'i am delighted that the tokyo foundation is hosting a conclave on the theme of asian values and democracy on january 19 as follow-up of the conclave held by vivekananda international foundation in delhi last year .'
p14282
aS'the theme of the two-day conference held in delhi in september 2015 was conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness from the hindu buddhist civilizational perspective .'
p14283
aS'it is universally accepted that this century belongs to asia .'
p14284
aS'asia is at the crossroads of a very special moment in the history of humanity .'
p14285
aS'this is a continent bustling with energy , enthusiasm and exuberance , driven by the dynamism of a youthful population that is constantly innovating .'
p14286
aS'all asian civilizations , indic , shinto , or dao , had had a common value system which could avoid conflicts among humans and between humans and nature -- the conflict among states being different .'
p14287
aS'that common value system recognizes , accepts and even celebrates diversity among humans .'
p14288
aS'this is what leads to conflict avoidance as it is founded on harmony in diversity .'
p14289
aS'conflict avoidance based on harmonizing the diversity of humans is inherent in asian democracy as its basic value .'
p14290
aS'our idea of democracy is not just a game of numbers mediated by the rules of majority and minority as it happens in numerical democracies .'
p14291
aS'our democratic approach is founded on consensus .'
p14292
aS'it does not rest on the idea of rights alone but also includes duties .'
p14293
aS'the indian constitution provides for moral fundamental duties of individuals towards one another and to the creation which sustains us all .'
p14294
aS'our idea of democracy is founded on values which recognize the space of not only humans but also of nature -- animals and plants -- which incorporates the principles of environment .'
p14295
aS'the inclusion of nature and environment makes our life and approach less anthropocentric and more eco-centric .'
p14296
aS'great indian thinkers like maharishi aurobindo , swami vivekananda and rabindranath tagore have envisioned asian unity in this higher sense of the term .'
p14297
aS'i am sure that with its theme of asian values and democracy , the tokyo conclave will enable india and japan to expand articulate and include the concepts of conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness as integral to our larger democratic framework .'
p14298
aS'with this i wish the tokyo conclave all success .'
p14299
aS'i send my heartiest congratulations to the tokyo foundation and the japanese government for having organized this meeting .'
p14300
aS'thank you .'

S'shri vineet jain distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen i am very happy to be here today .'
p14303
aS'the global economy is going through a period of uncertainty .'
p14304
aS'at a time like this i am glad that so many participants not only from india , but also from abroad have taken the time to come here .'
p14305
aS'i am sure all of us in india will benefit from the experience of other countries .'
p14306
aS'i will take this opportunity to present to you some of my thoughts on the progress of the indian economy and on the business environment .'
p14307
aS'some of you may recall what i have said before - that true reforms are those which result in transformation in the lives of citizens .'
p14308
aS'as i have said before , my goal is reform to transform .'
p14309
aS'let me start with the basics .'
p14310
aS'what should be the basic guiding principles of economic policy in any country , particularly for the developing countries ?'
p14311
aS'firstly , we have to improve the use of our natural and human resources , to increase the value addition we can get from them .'
p14312
aS'this means increasing the efficiency in allocation of resources .'
p14313
aS'it means greater managerial efficiency .'
p14314
aS'it means removing unnecessary controls and distortions .'
p14315
aS'secondly , we should create new opportunities for citizens to progress and also give them a choice of opportunities .'
p14316
aS'opportunity is like oxygen to the aspirational citizen and we are keen that this is never in short supply .'
p14317
aS'in simple terms , it means sabka saath , sabka vikas .'
p14318
aS'thirdly , we have to increase the quality of life of the common citizen and even more so , the quality of life of the poor .'
p14319
aS'quality of life may have an economic aspect , but it is not economics alone .'
p14320
aS'if a government is progressive , and runs an honest and efficient administration , the biggest beneficiaries are the poor .'
p14321
aS'i know from my experience , that poor governance hurts the poor more than it hurts others .'
p14322
aS'therefore , improved governance is as important as economic reform .'
p14323
aS'we live in a globally connected world .'
p14324
aS'actions of one country affect another .'
p14325
aS'such actions are not only based on trade and investment but also in matters of pollution and environment .'
p14326
aS'a poet had said that no man is an island .'
p14327
aS'today it can be said that no country can live alone .'
p14328
aS'it is often said that all politics is local .'
p14329
aS'to me , all economics is global .'
p14330
aS'indeed the distinction between domestic affairs and foreign affairs is increasingly losing relevance .'
p14331
aS'for a country in the modern day , it is not sufficient that its economic policies should only address its domestic priorities .'
p14332
aS'to me , indias policies must be such that they make a positive contribution to the rest of the world .'
p14333
aS'many of you are aware of the contribution india can make to the global economy at a time of economic stagnation in many parts .'
p14334
aS'for the last four quarters , india has been the fastest growing large economy in the world .'
p14335
aS'in 2014-15 , india contributed 7.'
p14336
aS'4 % of global gdp in purchasing power terms .'
p14337
aS'but it contributed 12.'
p14338
aS'5 % of global growth .'
p14339
aS'thus its contribution to growth is 68 % higher than its share of the global economy .'
p14340
aS'fdi in india has increased by 39 % in the last 18 months , at a time when global fdi has fallen .'
p14341
aS'but a countrys contribution goes beyond economics .'
p14342
aS'protecting our planet from climate change is one of the most important tasks for this generation .'
p14343
aS'if one country reduces its environmental footprint , it creates benefits for all others .'
p14344
aS'it is for this reason that in the cop 21 summit , india made far reaching commitments towards the larger welfare of the planet .'
p14345
aS'in history , every country that has grown has increased its per capita emissions footprint .'
p14346
aS'we are committed to re-writing that history .'
p14347
aS'we are committed to reducing the emission intensity of our gdp by 33 % by 2030 even while growing at a fast pace .'
p14348
aS'for a country which is already at a very low base of per capita emission , this is a very ambitious target .'
p14349
aS'we have committed that by 2030 , 40 % of our electric power capacity will be from non-fossil fuel .'
p14350
aS'we have also committed to building an additional carbon sink of over 2.'
p14351
aS'5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent .'
p14352
aS'this will be done by creating additional forest cover by 2030 .'
p14353
aS'this commitment is from a country with a very low per capita land availability .'
p14354
aS'we have taken the lead in launching an international solar alliance , involving 121 countries falling between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn .'
p14355
aS'this initiative will help many developing countries , from africa to south america , to take advantage of developments in renewable energy around the world .'
p14356
aS'let me now return to the three policy objectives i mentioned .'
p14357
aS'i will start with the performance of indian economy .'
p14358
aS'economists talk about gdp growth , inflation , investment , and the fiscal deficit as key economic parameters .'
p14359
aS'since this government took office , growth has increased and inflation has decreased .'
p14360
aS'foreign investment has increased and the fiscal deficit has decreased .'
p14361
aS'and despite a slow-down in global trade , the balance of payments deficit has also decreased .'
p14362
aS'yet , such broad statistics give only a partial picture of what we are attempting , and what we are achieving .'
p14363
aS'it is often said the devil is in the detail .'
p14364
aS'but i believe that god is in the proper execution of many so-called details .'
p14365
aS'it is these so-called details which , when done well , add up to a big picture .'
p14366
aS'you may be interested to know that - indias highest ever urea fertiliser production was achieved in 2015 .'
p14367
aS'- indias highest ever production of ethanol as blended fuel , benefiting sugar cane farmers , was in 2015 .'
p14368
aS'- the highest number of new cooking gas connections to the rural poor was achieved in 2015 .'
p14369
aS'- indias highest ever output of coal was achieved in 2015 .'
p14370
aS'- indias highest ever generation of electricity was achieved in 2015 - indias highest ever quantity of cargo handled by major ports was in 2015 .'
p14371
aS'- indias fastest average turnaround time in ports was in 2015 .'
p14372
aS'- indias highest ever increase in railway capital expenditure was achieved in 2015 .'
p14373
aS'- indias highest ever number of new highway kilometres awarded was in 2015 .'
p14374
aS'- indias highest ever production of motor vehicles was achieved in 2015 - indias highest ever software exports were achieved in 2015 .'
p14375
aS'- indias highest ever rank in world bank doing business indicators , was achieved in 2015 .'
p14376
aS'- indias highest ever foreign exchange reserves were achieved in 2015 .'
p14377
aS'when i give these figures , it is important to remember that in the preceding years , many of these indicators were moving in the opposite direction .'
p14378
aS'not only have many indicators improved , but they have improved by large margins .'
p14379
aS'for example , in 2013-14 , the total number of national highway kilometres awarded was about 3500 .'
p14380
aS'this more than doubled in the first year of this government to nearly 8000 kilometres , an all-time high .'
p14381
aS'this year we are planning to award 10,000 kilometres .'
p14382
aS'let me give you more examples of quantum leaps .'
p14383
aS'the shipping corporation of india which made a loss of rs .'
p14384
aS'275 crores in 2013-14 made a profit of rs .'
p14385
aS'201 crores in 2014-15 .'
p14386
aS'this is a turnaround of rs .'
p14387
aS'475 crores in one single year .'
p14388
aS'in 2013-14 , india accounted for just 0.'
p14389
aS'1 % of global demand for energy efficient led lighting .'
p14390
aS'in 2015-16 , it is 12 % .'
p14391
aS'indian led bulbs are now the cheapest and most competitive in the world , costing less than a dollar versus a global average of 3 dollars .'
p14392
aS'in 2013-14 , india commissioned 947 megawatts of solar power plants .'
p14393
aS'in 2015-16 , this will rise to over 2500 megawatts .'
p14394
aS'it is expected to reach 12,000 megawatts in 2016-17 .'
p14395
aS'indias share of the global solar energy market will rise from 2.'
p14396
aS'5 % in 2014 to 18 % in 2016 .'
p14397
aS'indias contribution here is not merely in increasing the share of clean energy .'
p14398
aS'its other contribution is that the huge increase in scale has enabled producers to cut prices benefitting the whole world .'
p14399
aS'in 2013-14 , 16,800 kilometres of transmission lines were added .'
p14400
aS'in 2014-15 this rose to over 22,000 , an increase of 32 % .'
p14401
aS'in the power sector as a whole , the cost of power has declined by over 30 % .'
p14402
aS'let me turn to the second aspect improving opportunities .'
p14403
aS'i believe in the politics of empowerment .'
p14404
aS'i believe in empowering the people to improve their own lives .'
p14405
aS'we undertook the worlds largest and most successful financial inclusion programme .'
p14406
aS'it has brought over two hundred million unbanked people into the banking system .'
p14407
aS'in the early days of this programme , sceptics felt that these accounts would have no balances .'
p14408
aS'you will be surprised to know that today these accounts have a balance exceeding rs .'
p14409
aS'thirty thousand crores or over four billion dollars .'
p14410
aS'we have also issued a record number of debit cards to them .'
p14411
aS'india is now one of the few countries where the market share of an indigenous credit card brand exceeds 33 % .'
p14412
aS'we have introduced a new and comprehensive program of crop insurance .'
p14413
aS'this empowers farmers to give their best , with the state providing cover against risks beyond the farmers control .'
p14414
aS'we have introduced soil health cards to empower our farmers .'
p14415
aS'the card will tell every farmer the exact character of his soil .'
p14416
aS'this will enable him to increase crop yield , reduce over-use of chemical inputs and fertilizer and restore soil health .'
p14417
aS'entrepreneurship is one of indias traditional strengths .'
p14418
aS'it was sad to see it neglected in the last few years .'
p14419
aS'business and profits had become bad words .'
p14420
aS'we have changed that .'
p14421
aS'we need to value enterprise and hard work , not wealth .'
p14422
aS'our programs ranging from mudra to start up india and stand-up india provide opportunity to the hard working and to the enterprising .'
p14423
aS'in so doing , we have placed special emphasis on scheduled castes , scheduled tribes , other backward classes and women .'
p14424
aS'we are empowering them to become masters of their own destinies .'
p14425
aS'creating opportunities for cities and towns to grow is very crucial .'
p14426
aS'urban areas are an engine of growth .'
p14427
aS'a key initiative for urban transformation is the smart city mission .'
p14428
aS'the mission has several firsts .'
p14429
aS'it is the first time that certain areas in cities will be comprehensively developed in a systematic and qualitative way .'
p14430
aS'these areas will act as light houses which will eventually influence the rest of the city .'
p14431
aS'it is the first time that there has been such extensive citizen consultation .'
p14432
aS'nearly 2.'
p14433
aS'5 million people participated through contests , discussions , polls , blogs and talks on the mygov platform .'
p14434
aS'this is a major break from the top-down approach to urban planning .'
p14435
aS'it is the first time that allocation of funds in a government scheme is done not by decisions of ministers or officers but on the basis of competition .'
p14436
aS'this is a good example of competitive and cooperative federalism .'
p14437
aS'as i mentioned earlier , the role of a government does not end with the economy alone .'
p14438
aS'there are many non-economic dimensions which are vital for ensuring the welfare of the citizens .'
p14439
aS'good governance is crucial .'
p14440
aS'we have taken numerous steps which have transformative potential .'
p14441
aS'we have ended the era of high level corruption .'
p14442
aS'this is a fact acknowledged by indians and foreigners , and by critics and supporters of this government .'
p14443
aS'this is not an easy achievement .'
p14444
aS'we have ended political interference and crony capitalism in nationalized banks .'
p14445
aS'we have for the first time appointed several heads of public sector banks from the private sector .'
p14446
aS'transparent auctions have cleaned up the natural resources sector which was riddled with scandals .'
p14447
aS'many experts have commented on the need to reduce subsidies .'
p14448
aS'the new universal access to banking through the jan dhan yojana , has enabled plugging of huge leakages in subsidies .'
p14449
aS'in developing countries , fuel subsidies are generally very difficult to tackle .'
p14450
aS'we have successfully decontrolled cooking gas prices .'
p14451
aS'we are now operating the worlds largest direct benefit transfer scheme for cooking gas .'
p14452
aS'subsidies are transferred to the bank account of households .'
p14453
aS'through electronic verification , multiple and bogus connections are eliminated .'
p14454
aS'this enables genuine beneficiaries to get what they deserve while eliminating those who are not eligible .'
p14455
aS'this has substantially reduced the subsidy .'
p14456
aS'another subsidized fuel is kerosene , used by the poor for cooking and lighting , and distributed by state governments .'
p14457
aS'there is clear evidence that a large quantity of subsidized kerosene is misused and diverted .'
p14458
aS'we have begun a pilot in thirty three districts where kerosene will be sold at market prices .'
p14459
aS'the difference between market price and the subsidized price will be transferred directly to bank accounts of those who are poor .'
p14460
aS'the poor will be properly identified through bank accounts and biometric identification through aadhaar .'
p14461
aS'this will eliminate duplicate , non-eligible and bogus consumers .'
p14462
aS'this elimination will reduce the total subsidy .'
p14463
aS'we have decided that 75 % of the savings from this will be passed on to the states .'
p14464
aS'thereby , we have encouraged state governments to implement this in all districts .'
p14465
aS'the experience of chandigarh , shows that this is possible .'
p14466
aS'in april 2014 , there were 68,000 beneficiaries of subsidized kerosene in chandigarh .'
p14467
aS'a campaign was launched to issue gas connections to all eligible families .'
p14468
aS'10,500 new gas connections were issued .'
p14469
aS'kerosene quotas were stopped for 42,000 families who already had gas connections .'
p14470
aS'by 31st march , 2016 , chandigarh will be declared kerosene-free .'
p14471
aS'believe it or not , till date , the saving achieved in kerosene consumption through this initiative is 73 % !'
p14472
aS'two days ago at a meeting with chief secretaries of the states , i was reviewing implementation of various pension schemes .'
p14473
aS'i was pleasantly surprised to see that there had been noteworthy reduction in leakage , simply by eliminating those who were double counted and who were ineligible .'
p14474
aS'in some states , a reduction of 12 % in subsidies has been achieved without any harm to the poor .'
p14475
aS'another major subsidy is on fertilizer .'
p14476
aS'a substantial quantity of subsidized urea is diverted illegally to use in the production of chemicals .'
p14477
aS'we have introduced a simple but effective technical solution : neem-coating of urea .'
p14478
aS'the organic neem coating makes the fertilizer unsuitable for diversion .'
p14479
aS'we have now achieved 100 % neem coating in both domestic and imported urea .'
p14480
aS'a significant side benefit has also happened .'
p14481
aS'the collection of neem leaves for urea has become a new income earning opportunity for rural women .'
p14482
aS'i know that several of you are economists .'
p14483
aS'economists generally believe that human beings are rational .'
p14484
aS'they believe people will not give up a benefit for which they are entitled .'
p14485
aS'last year , i gave a call to citizens .'
p14486
aS'i asked them to give up their cooking gas subsidies , if they felt they were not poor enough to get it .'
p14487
aS'we also made a promise .'
p14488
aS'every connection given up , would be used to give a new gas connection to a poor family .'
p14489
aS'poor women in rural india use firewood or biomass and suffer greatly because of smoke .'
p14490
aS'this scheme is entirely voluntary .'
p14491
aS'you may be surprised to learn that nearly 6.'
p14492
aS'5 million people in india have responded to my call .'
p14493
aS'it warms my heart , to see that so many of them have come forward , with no compulsion to benefit the poor and give up their subsidies .'
p14494
aS'already , over 5 million new connections have been given to the poor .'
p14495
aS'it is a sign of the public spirit and the self-respect which prevails among indians and shows the potential of citizen action .'
p14496
aS'another example where citizens have responded is in the case of khadi .'
p14497
aS'in october 2014 , i had appealed to all indians to buy at least one khadi garment .'
p14498
aS'in response , khadi sales have increased substantially .'
p14499
aS'we have taken a creative approach to tackling the problem of loss making power distribution companies .'
p14500
aS'under the uday programme , short term debt relief is given by state governments taking over bank loans .'
p14501
aS'but this is accompanied by strong long term conditions to hold both the distribution companies and the states .'
p14502
aS'this will create the conditions for rolling out 24x7 power supply .'
p14503
aS'our country suffers from an excess of old and unnecessary laws which obstruct people and businesses .'
p14504
aS'we began the exercise of identifying unnecessary laws and repealing them .'
p14505
aS'1,827 central laws have been identified for repeal .'
p14506
aS'out of these , 125 have already been repealed .'
p14507
aS'bills for repealing another 758 have been passed by the lok sabha and are awaiting the approval of the upper house .'
p14508
aS'i have given just a few examples of the potential of improved governance .'
p14509
aS'the benefits of improved governance and reduced corruption are lasting and profound .'
p14510
aS'if our policies are studied closely , you will find that many are popular , but none are populist .'
p14511
aS'every one of the changes we have made is in the direction of good governance and rationality .'
p14512
aS'i have been referring to cooking gas , fertilizer and kerosene subsidies .'
p14513
aS'i must confess that i am surprised by the way words are used by experts on this matter .'
p14514
aS'when a benefit is given to farmers or to the poor , experts and government officers normally call it a subsidy .'
p14515
aS'however , i find that if a benefit is given to industry or commerce , it is usually called an incentive or a subvention .'
p14516
aS'we must ask ourselves whether this difference in language also reflects a difference in our attitude ?'
p14517
aS'why is it that subsidies going to the well-off are portrayed in a positive manner ?'
p14518
aS'let me give you an example .'
p14519
aS'the total revenue loss from incentives to corporate tax payers was over rs .'
p14520
aS'62,000 crores .'
p14521
aS'dividends and long term capital gains on shares traded in stock exchanges are totally exempt from income tax even though it is not the poor who earn them .'
p14522
aS'since it is exempt , it is not even counted in the rs .'
p14523
aS'62,000 crores .'
p14524
aS'double taxation avoidance treaties have in some cases resulted in double non-taxation .'
p14525
aS'this also is not counted in the rs .'
p14526
aS'62,000 crores .'
p14527
aS'yet these are rarely referred to by those who seek reduction of subsidies .'
p14528
aS'perhaps these are seen as incentives for investment .'
p14529
aS'i wonder whether , if the fertiliser subsidy is re-named as incentive for agricultural production , some experts will view it differently .'
p14530
aS'i am not arguing that all subsidies are good .'
p14531
aS'my point is that there can not be any ideological position on such matters .'
p14532
aS'we have to be pragmatic .'
p14533
aS'we have to eliminate bad subsidies , whether or not they are called subsidies .'
p14534
aS'but some subsidies may be necessary to protect the poor and the needy and give them a fair chance to succeed .'
p14535
aS'hence my aim is not to eliminate subsidies but to rationalize and target them .'
p14536
aS'in 19 months , much has been achieved .'
p14537
aS'much more is expected of us .'
p14538
aS'and there are challenges ahead .'
p14539
aS'yet , i am now confident - that we can successfully go forward , - that we can successfully go faster , - and that we can do so in a way that will benefit the common people .'
p14540
aS'when the people of a nation make up their minds to go forward and when the power of the people is with us , hard challenges become huge opportunities .'
p14541
aS'this confidence of mine is not formed in a vacuum , but founded on my experience over the last 19 months .'
p14542
aS'we inherited a struggling economy , just recovering from a currency crisis .'
p14543
aS'in less than two years , we have taken india to the top of global league tables of foreign investment and growth .'
p14544
aS'friends , we have a long way to go but i feel ours is a journey well begun .'
p14545
aS'like all long journeys , there may be obstacles on the way , but i am confident we will reach our destination .'
p14546
aS'we have created a platform for a new future and for a new india : an india where every child is born safely and maternal and infant mortality are below world averages , an india where no person is houseless , an india where every town and every village , every school and every train , every street and every house , are clean and sanitary , an india where every citizen has access to good health care , an india where every village has 24x7 electricity , an india where every city is vibrant and livable , an india where girls are educated and empowered , an india where every boy and every girl is skilled and ready for productive employment , an india where agriculture , industry and services provide well-paying jobs to all who need them , an india where farmers know the nature of their soil , have the best inputs and reach global levels of productivity , an india where enterprises , large and small , have access to capital and credit , an india where start-ups and other businesses provide innovative solutions , an india which is at the forefront of a global digital economy , an india which leads the world in clean energy , an india where every citizen has basic social security and a pension in old age , an india where citizens trust government and are trusted by government .'
p14547
aS'and above all , a transformed india where all citizens have the opportunity to reach their full potential .'
p14548
aS'thank you .'
p14549
aa(lp14550
S'namaskar , distinguished guests , ladies and gentlemen !'
p14551
aS'i am happy to be present here for the inaugural function of the vision conclave as a part of the global ayurveda festival organized in gods own country - kerala .'
p14552
aS'kerala is the hub of traditional ayurveda .'
p14553
aS'this is not only due to the long , uninterrupted practice of ayurveda in this state , but also due to the global popularity of its authentic medicines and therapies , and now , the vast , fast growing network of health resorts and hospitals of ayurveda .'
p14554
aS'i have been informed that the five-day global ayurveda festival has turned out to be excellent in terms of participation and projection of the various facets of ayurveda .'
p14555
aS'it is heartening to note that foreign delegates in large numbers have come from various countries to participate in the ayurveda festival .'
p14556
aS'i am sure their participation in this festival will provide a lot of impetus to the spread of ayurveda .'
p14557
aS'in india we have had a long great tradition of saints and hermits who evolved our own indigenous systems of healthcare , like ayurveda , yoga and siddha .'
p14558
aS'over time , we also interacted with different civilizations and assimilated other systems of medicine as well .'
p14559
aS'all these systems were based on the philosophy of , .'
p14560
aS'that is : all should remain happy , all should remain healthy .'
p14561
aS'ayurveda is generally defined as science of life by translating ayuh ( r ) as life and veda as science .'
p14562
aS'sushruta defines health as : samdosha , samagni , samdhatu malakriyah prasannatma , indriyas manah swath abhidayate .'
p14563
aS'this means that health is balanced when all three doshas or bioenergy and agni or metabolic process are balanced , and excretions are in proper order .'
p14564
aS'when atman or soul , senses , manah or intellect are in harmony with internal peace , svastha or optimal health is achieved .'
p14565
aS'compare this with the definition of health that the world health organization uses : health is a complete state of physical , mental and social well-being , and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity .'
p14566
aS'so we see how strongly the principles of ayurveda are aligned with the definition of health propagated by the who .'
p14567
aS'health is the complete state of well being and not the absence of disease .'
p14568
aS'today , ayurveda is relevant globally because of its holistic and comprehensive approach to health .'
p14569
aS'the ayurvedic dincharya or daily schedule helps to bring about peace and harmony in ones life .'
p14570
aS'ayurvedic daily life routines are meant to enhance the total health of a human being , both mental and physical .'
p14571
aS'what are the great health challenges that the world is facing today ?'
p14572
aS'non-communicable diseases , lifestyle related diseases like hypertension , diabetes , and cancers have become the greatest health challenges .'
p14573
aS'who estimates that non-communicable diseases kill about 38 million people each year and almost three quarters of ncd deaths , that is 28 million , occur in low and middle-income countries .'
p14574
aS'it is in managing these that ayurveda offers solutions .'
p14575
aS'the long tradition of saints and hermits who created indian systems of healthcare like ayurveda , yoga and siddha believes in a harmonious relationship with nature .'
p14576
aS'these systems try to create balance and preserve health through eco-friendly practices and sustainable sourcing of medicinal herbs .'
p14577
aS'unfortunately , the real potential of ayurveda is untapped because of many reasons .'
p14578
aS'most importantly because of inadequate scientific scrutiny and concerns regarding standards and quality .'
p14579
aS'if these issues are addressed properly , i am sure ayurveda can provide solutions to many health problems .'
p14580
aS'india can be a leader in making affordable , holistic health care available to the world .'
p14581
aS'what can we do , and what are we doing to address these issues ?'
p14582
aS'our government is fully committed to promotion of ayurveda and traditional systems of medicine .'
p14583
aS'as soon as this government was formed , the department of ayush was upgraded to the status of a full ministry in the government of india .'
p14584
aS'the national ayush mission has been started to promote ayush medical systems through cost effective ayush services , strengthening of educational systems , facilitating the enforcement of quality control of ayurveda , siddha and unani & homoeopathy drugs and sustainable availability of raw-materials .'
p14585
aS'for quality control of ayush drugs , steps are being taken to bring regulatory amendments for effective enforcement and strengthening the regulatory framework at the central and state levels .'
p14586
aS'creating a vertical structure for ayush drugs in central drug standards control organization , control over misleading advertisements and extension of financial support to the states under national ayush mission for quality control activities are important initiatives that are underway .'
p14587
aS'to ensure credibility of knowledge and skills of yoga experts , a scheme for voluntary certification of yoga professionals has been launched on 22nd june last year during the international conference on yoga for holistic health .'
p14588
aS'our policy regarding ayurveda and other indian systems of medicine is already aligned with the traditional medicine strategy 2014-2023 of who , which has been adopted in the world health assembly for implementation by 192 member countries of who .'
p14589
aS'the who strategy contains methodologies for harnessing the potential contribution of traditional and complementary medicine to health , wellness and person-centered healthcare .'
p14590
aS"in the words of swami vivekananda , therefore , we shall-  combine the best of east with that of the west '' ."
p14591
aS'modern systems of medicine have strong and effective diagnostic tools that allow us to screen and detect disease early .'
p14592
aS'the use of technology in healthcare has the potential to reduce barriers to accessing care , and improve our understanding of disease patterns .'
p14593
aS'however , we do need to look beyond .'
p14594
aS'we need to look beyond providing healthcare and engage in the pursuit of good health , a combination of physical and mental well being .'
p14595
aS'the escalating costs of treatment , the side effects of medicines have prompted medical experts to think of widening their horizons to traditional systems of medicine .'
p14596
aS'we are committed to promote the use of traditional medicine in our public health system through regulation of research and appropriate integration of quality products , practices , and practitioners into the health system .'
p14597
aS'our efforts are to tap the real potential of ayurveda and other ayush systems in imparting preventive , promotive and holistic healthcare to the people .'
p14598
aS'we will maximize the utilization of ayurveda and yoga and other traditions of healing in accordance with their genius and acumen and help promotion of integrative medical facilities .'
p14599
aS'young entrepreneurs who are planning a start-up could find a lot of opportunities in holistic healthcare .'
p14600
aS'in the context of health sector planning , while we think of the utility and contemporary relevance of ayurveda and other traditional medical systems , it is also important to ponder over the realities and the challenges faced by these systems .'
p14601
aS'traditional medicine is affordable to many of the rural people .'
p14602
aS'it is locally available to the communities , time-tested for its safety and efficacy .'
p14603
aS'above all , it imbibes the culture and eco-system of the communities within which it grows .'
p14604
aS'in many parts of developing countries , traditional medical practices are the only resources of healthcare within the physical and financial reach of the poor people .'
p14605
aS'it is therefore even more important that we ensure the quality of these systems .'
p14606
aS'all stakeholders of ayurveda gathered here must agree that it is important for us to address the issues of safety , efficacy , quality , access and rational use of our traditional medical knowledge of ayurveda .'
p14607
aS'we should also move closely with the emerging trends in the areas of bio-medicine , health technology and information technology .'
p14608
aS'i know that there have been great efforts in china to develop and establish policies and regulations for promoting the safe use of traditional chinese medicine , which comprises a large chunk of the international trade of complementary and alternative medicine .'
p14609
aS'we will learn from the experience of other countries , and ensure that ayurveda and other indian systems are propagated and popularised .'
p14610
aS'i am also told that the delhi declaration on traditional medicine adopted by the south east asian countries in february 2013 and later resolved by the who regional committee seeks member countries to follow harmonized approaches for developmental activities of traditional medicine .'
p14611
aS'i hope , proper implementation of articles of the delhi declaration will help to achieve systematic development of traditional medicine including ayurveda as well at national , regional and global level .'
p14612
aS'we would like to offer our institutions as referral centres for training , capacity building and information & technology exchange programs in ayurveda and other ayush systems .'
p14613
aS'our leadership on these fronts can be sustained only with concerted efforts for rendering quality healthcare and education and by producing competent professionals .'
p14614
aS'ladies and gentlemen , as you are well aware , india has a long history and rich heritage of ayurveda and yoga .'
p14615
aS'the multi-cultural origins of ayurvedic knowledge are revealed in the classical texts themselves .'
p14616
aS'both charaka samhita and sushruta samhita urge physicians to seek the help of cowherds , hunters and forest-dwellers for procuring medicinal plants .'
p14617
aS'in the charaka samhita , we notice the participation and contribution of a central asian physician in one of the assemblies of scholars gathered to formulate the principles of ayurveda .'
p14618
aS'the three major classical texts give importance to buddhist moral values .'
p14619
aS'vagbhata , who is said to be the author of one of the classical texts ashtangahridayam , was a buddhist .'
p14620
aS'it is evident , therefore , that these traditions grew by sharing knowledge , both locally as well as across cultures .'
p14621
aS'they learnt from the most humble as well as those with arcane knowledge .'
p14622
aS'we will continue this effort .'
p14623
aS'we will share the knowledge of our systems with the world , and continue to enrich our traditions by learning from other systems .'
p14624
aS'the global ayurveda festival takes this vision forward .'
p14625
aS'i wish the vision conclave as well as global ayurveda festival a grand success .'
p14626
aS'i trust that the deliberations will focus on the crucial issues important for the global positioning of ayurveda .'
p14627
aS'i will end with words from ashtangahridayam , one of the most famous texts of ayurveda .'
p14628
aS'the poor , those suffering from disease and those afflicted by sorrow should be helped .'
p14629
aS'even insects and ants should be treated with compassion , just as ones own self .'
p14630
aS'this is the guiding spirit of ayurveda .'
p14631
aS'let this be the guiding spirit for all of us .'
p14632
aa(lp14633
S'vanakkami have great pleasure to be amidst all of you at coimbatore , the textile capital of south india and the commercial hub of tamil nadu , to inaugurate the newly constructed buildingfor the medical college and the hospital .'
p14634
aS'on this occasion , the central government has also handed overthe existing hospital , the medical college , and related buildings to the government of tamil nadu .'
p14635
aS'it reinforces my governments commitment to co-operative federalism .'
p14636
aS'i hope that the government of tamil nadu will act quickly to start the college .'
p14637
aS'this project worth 580 crore rupees will be a boon to esicbeneficiariesand their family members in and around coimbatore .'
p14638
aS'of the 100 mbbs seats proposed here , 20 seats will be reserved for the children of persons insuredunder the esi scheme .'
p14639
aS'we should strive to make this medical college and hospital a model for high quality medical education and treatment to workers of the state .'
p14640
aS'my government is committed to the development of a generous and comprehensive social safety net for all workers .'
p14641
aS'for the over 45 crores unorganized sector workers , we have , in addition to the rsby health insurance program , started the pradhan mantri jeevan jyoti bima yojana , pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojana , and the atal pension yojanato provide life and accident insurance .'
p14642
aS'this commitment to the builders of modern india comes from the firm belief that a swasth and samridh shramikwill make a samridh rashtra .'
p14643
aS'we have initiated major reforms of the epfo and esicfor the benefit of organized sector employees .'
p14644
aS'a universal account number has so far been allotted to over 6 crore sector workers , enabling portability of their epf accounts .'
p14645
aS'further , we propose to expand coverage and offer additional facilities and services through the esic .'
p14646
aS'the esi scheme is based on the gandhian principle of contributions as per the ability and benefits as per the requirement .'
p14647
aS'this principle entitles an insured person or their family members to uniform benefits though only paying a contribution proportionate to his or her wage .'
p14648
aS'apart from medical benefit , esic also provides sickness , disablement , dependants , maternity , and unemployment allowance benefits to the insured persons .'
p14649
aS'its unique character , with no restrictions on the expenditure and instances where more than 30 to 40 lakh rupees have been spent on treatments , means that esic health scheme has been a boon to millions of workers .'
p14650
aS'friends , from itsmodest beginning in 1952 with just two centers in kanpur and delhi , the esi scheme today is implemented in 830 centers in 34 states and union territories .'
p14651
aS'it covers over 7 lakh factories and establishments across the countryand benefits 2 crore workers and about 8 crore beneficiaries .'
p14652
aS'in tamil nadu , the scheme has over 85,000 participating employersand over 28 lakh insured persons , with coimbatore itself having nearly 27,000 employers .'
p14653
aS'it is available in 31 districts of tamil nadu .'
p14654
aS'there are ten esi hospitals in tamil nadu .'
p14655
aS'after handing over this hospital , there will be eight esi hospitals in the state run by the state government .'
p14656
aS'the esic hospital tirunelveliis proposed for upgradation from 50 to 100 beds .'
p14657
aS'there is a large network of 210 esi dispensaries in the state for out-patient treatment for the insured persons and their family members .'
p14658
aS'coimbatore itself has 50 dispensaries .'
p14659
aS'my government is dedicated to the welfare of our brothers and sisterswho are our rashtra nirmatas .'
p14660
aS'sensing the need for expansion of esic , i had launched a second generation reform agenda named esic 2.'
p14661
aS'0 in july last yearduring the indian labour conference held in new delhi .'
p14662
aS'the coverage of esi scheme has been extended to the remaining north-east statesarunachal pradesh , mizoram , manipur and andaman & nicobar island .'
p14663
aS'it is proposed to expand the coverage from only the industrial and commercial clusters within a district to the entire district by 31st march this year .'
p14664
aS'since 1st august last year , the scheme has been extended to construction workers .'
p14665
aS'i strongly believe in the improvement of public service delivery standards .'
p14666
aS'in keeping with this , several initiatives have been started to improve the quality of service deliveryin esi hospitals .'
p14667
aS'they includeonline availability of electronic health record of esi beneficiaries , establishment of an emergency medical helpline , and creation of special out patient services for senior citizens and differently-abled persons in esic hospitals .'
p14668
aS'to improve cleanliness , the abhiyan indradhanushchanges bedsheets according to the rainbow pattern each day of the week .'
p14669
aS'and cleanliness is an important aspect of preventive healthcare .'
p14670
aS'studies show that it can lead to savings of almost 7000 rupees per year for a poor family .'
p14671
aS'among other initiatives , the esic has resolved to adopt two model hospitals in each state , apart from a mother and child care hospital .'
p14672
aS'i am happy that esic proposes to expand coverage by complementing its own services with public private partnerships .'
p14673
aS'apart from cancer detection , cardiology treatment , and dialysis , the corporation also proposes to offer in a phased manner pathological and x-ray facilities in all its dispensaries through ppps .'
p14674
aS'besides allopathic treatment , esic hospitals will also provide ayush treatment in a phased manner .'
p14675
aS'friends , my government has taken a number of path-breaking steps for the welfare of workforce of our country .'
p14676
aS'from september 2014 , we have revised the employee provident fund organization ( epfo ) pension to a minimum of 1000 rupees per month .'
p14677
aS'the wage ceiling for epf benefits has been raised from 6500 to 15000 rupees .'
p14678
aS'an epfo mobile app has been launched for easier access to its services for both workers and employers .'
p14679
aS'the bonus act has been amended to increase the ceilings for eligibility and bonus payable to 21,000 and 7000 rupees per month respectively .'
p14680
aS'keeping in mind our commitment to minimum government , maximum governance , the ministry is simplifying central labour laws by consolidating the existing 44 laws into four labour codes .'
p14681
aS'namely , on wages , industrial relations , safety and security , and health .'
p14682
aS'this would considerably increase the ease of doing business and facilitate job creation , without compromising on the genuine protections and rights available for workers .'
p14683
aS'we are progressing on the reform path by building consensus on these reforms through extensive stakeholder consultations with employers , workers representatives , and state governments .'
p14684
aS'a shram suvidha portal has been created for online services related to 16 labor laws , including administering a process of transparent and random inspections of businesses .'
p14685
aS'a lin number has been issued to nearly one million employers , enabling them to process single online filings oneight labour laws .'
p14686
aS'the services offered by esic and epfohave been integrated with the e-biz portal of the department of industrial policy and promotion to promote ease of business and limit transaction costs .'
p14687
aS'further , it is proposed to promulgatenew epfo and esic acts providing more choice , increased coverage among workers and employers , and better and expanded range of services for organized sector workers .'
p14688
aS'our plans to expand esic facilities , indeed the establishment of this medical college itself , is part of a larger plan to upgrade the facilities for medical education and specialized tertiary care .'
p14689
aS'we have also approved a scheme for up-gradation of existing state and central government medical colleges to increase mbbs seats .'
p14690
aS'through this , we hope to increase 10,000 mbbs seats and support the colleges with funds for equipment and infrastructure .'
p14691
aS'so far 23 medical colleges have been approved to increase over 1,700 mbbs seats .'
p14692
aS'i am happy to inform that four state government medical colleges in tamil nadu at coimbatore , kanyakumari , tirunelveli and madurai have been approved for upgradation by adding 345 more mbbs seats .'
p14693
aS'with similar objective , we are also promoting the establishment of aiims like institutions across the country .'
p14694
aS'one such institution has also been approved for tamil nadu and with the active support of the state government i hope this institution will start admissions quickly .'

p14764
aS'i am privileged to visit visakhapatnam .'
p14765
aS'the city has a special place in the heart of all indians .'
p14766
aS'my last visit to vishakhapatnam was in october of 2014 .'
p14767
aS'at that time , cyclone hudhud had left the city shattered in pieces .'
p14768
aS'but , the people of vishakhapatnam smiled in the face of adversity .'
p14769
aS'it is a tribute to the city that within 14 months , you have risen against all odds to welcome the navies from across the continents in this international fleet review .'
p14770
aS'a little over a year ago , we saw the full fury of the ocean .'
p14771
aS'today , thanks to the spirit of the people of visakhapatnam , we are discussing how the oceans can be a source of economic prosperity for all of us .'
p14772
aS'for its courage and resolve , we all salute the city of visakhapatnam .'

aS'my sincere gratitude also to chief minister chandrababu naiduji for his strong support for this international event .'
p14775
aS'for me personally , witnessing the harmony among the best of international navies here has been a rewarding experience .'
p14776
aS'just over three months earlier in october , we welcomed in delhi , for the first time ever , all the 54 african nations , including over 40 heads of state for the 3rd india-africa summit .'
p14777
aS'a few weeks earlier in august 2015 , india had hosted in jaipur 14 heads of the state for the second forum for india-pacific island cooperation .'
p14778
aS'just day before yesterday , we welcomed all the saarc countries for the 12th south asian games in guwahati .'
p14779
aS'and today it is our pleasure to welcome 50 foreign navies from every corner of the globe at indias second international fleet review- the first one on indias east coast .'
p14780
aS'your participation is a message of cooperation and friendship that we deeply cherish .'
p14781
aS'on behalf of my countrymen , i thank you all for accepting our invitation and joining in this event with such spirit .'
p14782
aS'to build on the gains from todays gathering , india would host the first ever global maritime summit in april this year .'
p14783
aS'its priority would be to scale up and strengthen the vibrant trade / investment / technology and commercial linkages between india and other maritime nations .'
p14784
aS'friends , the oceans and worlds waterways are global commons .'
p14785
aS'vasudhaiva kutumbakam the concept of whole world as a family is perhaps most vividly witnessed on the oceans of the planet , that connect us all .'
p14786
aS'the last time india hosted the international fleet review was in the year 2001 , in the city of mumbai .'
p14787
aS'the world of 2016 is vastly different .'
p14788
aS'its politics is turbulent , and its challenges complex .'
p14789
aS'at the same time , the oceans are the lifelines of global prosperity .'
p14790
aS'they present us with great economic opportunities to build our nations .'
p14791
aS'over 90 % of global merchandise trade is carried on the oceans .'
p14792
aS'over the last 15 years , its value has grown from about 6 trillion dollars to about 20 trillion dollars .'
p14793
aS'oceans are critical for the global energy security as over 60 % of worlds oil production moves through sea routes .'
p14794
aS'our ability to reap economic benefits from the oceans rests on our capacity to respond to the challenges in the maritime domain .'
p14795
aS'the threat of sea borne terror , of which india has been a direct victim , continues to endanger the regional and global peace and stability .'
p14796
aS'piracy too remains a strong challenge .'
p14797
aS'the threat of natural disasters like tsunamis and cyclones is ever present .'
p14798
aS'manmade problems such as oil spills , climate change continue to risk the stability of the maritime domain .'
p14799
aS'a peaceful and stable maritime environment is , therefore , critical for the regional and global security .'
p14800
aS'it is also a must to harvest the riches of the oceanic ecosystems .'
p14801
aS'given the scale and complexity of modern day challenges , the international maritime stability can not be the preserve of a single nation .'
p14802
aS'it has to be a shared goal and responsibility of all the seafaring countries .'
p14803
aS'to this end , the navies and maritime agencies of the world need to work together , and engineer virtuous cycles of cooperation .'
p14804
aS'but , where necessary , they also need to act to secure the international sea lanes of communication .'
p14805
aS'i believe that if oceans were to propel our economies , then we must : - use seas to build peace , friendship and trust , and curb conflict ; - respect and ensure freedom of navigation ; and- cooperate , not compete in responding to the challenges in the seas .'
p14806
aS'the large presence of foreign navies at this fleet review is a confirmation of our shared urge to walk the pathways of peace and cooperation to keep the maritime domain safe and secure .'
p14807
aS'friends , india is , and has always been , a maritime nation .'
p14808
aS'indias ancient sanskrit texts also refer to the oceans as the storehouse of chaturdashanam ratnanam , the 14 gems .'
p14809
aS'surrounded by sea from three sides , india has a long coastline of over 7500 kilometres .'
p14810
aS'we have been blessed with a rich maritime heritage ever since .'
p14811
aS'lothal in gujarat became one of the earliest sea ports of the world .'
p14812
aS'indias central location in the indian ocean has connected us with other cultures , shaped our maritime trade routes , influenced indias strategic thought , and defined our maritime character .'
p14813
aS'since the days of the indus valley civilization , india has maintained an extensive network of maritime links , including with africa , western asia , the mediterranean region , the west , south east asia and the far east .'
p14814
aS'we are delighted that the navies from all these regions have joined in this fleet review .'
p14815
aS'the photo essay book on the maritime heritage of india , that i have just released , showcases this glorious maritime tradition .'
p14816
aS'friends , in moderntimes too , the oceans , especially the indian ocean , occupy a vital place in indias national security and economic prosperity .'
p14817
aS'the waters of the indian ocean touch the shores of over 40 countries .'
p14818
aS'about half of worlds container traffic ; and close to one-third of worlds cargo traffic passes through this region .'
p14819
aS'90 % of our trade by volume and 90 % of our oil imports are carried on the seas .'
p14820
aS'indias 1200 island territories , and our huge exclusive economic zone of 2.'
p14821
aS'4 million square kilometers makes clear the economic significance of the indian ocean .'
p14822
aS'for us , it also serves as a strategic bridge with the nations in our immediate and extended maritime neighbourhood .'
p14823
aS'in march last year , in mauritius , i had spelt out our vision for the indian ocean .'
p14824
aS'the indian ocean region is one of my foremost policy priorities .'
p14825
aS'our approach is evident in our vision of sagar , which means ocean and stands for security and growth for all in the region .'
p14826
aS'we would continue to actively pursue and promote our geo-political , strategic and economic interests on the seas , in particular the indian ocean .'
p14827
aS'to this end , indias modern and multi-dimensional navy leads from the front .'
p14828
aS'it is a force for peace and good .'
p14829
aS'a network of growing political and economic maritime partnerships , and strengthening of regional frameworksalso helps us pursue our goals .'

p14832
aS'regionally and internationally , we are a pillar of stability and an important growth centre .'
p14833
aS'indias rise is in harmony with the goal of maintaining the regional and global peace and security .'
p14834
aS'within the country , there is great optimism , enthusiasm and a can do mindset .'

aS'our skill india program is building institutions that train , support , encourage and guide our 800 million youth on the path of entrepreneurship .'
p14844
aS'our skilled youth are ready to respond to the national and global manpower demands of the 21st century .'
p14845
aS'an important part of indias transformation is my vision of blue economythe blue chakra or the wheel in our national flag , represents the potential of the blue economy .'
p14846
aS'an essential part of this pursuit is the development of indias coastal and island territories : but , not just for tourism .'
p14847
aS'we want to build new pillars of economic activity in the coastal areas and in linked hinterlands through sustainable tapping of oceanic resources .'
p14848
aS'strengthening our marine research , development of eco-friendly , marine industrial and technology base , and fisheries are other elements of our goal .'

p14865
aS'when i look back at the launch of the make in india initiative over a year ago , i also recall the aspirations of our youth .'
p14866
aS'65 per cent of the population of india is under the age of 35 .'
p14867
aS'this youthful energy is our greatest strength .'
p14868
aS'we launched the make in india campaign to create employment and self-employment opportunities for our youth .'
p14869
aS'we are working aggressively towards making india a global manufacturing hub .'
p14870
aS'we want the share of manufacturing in our gdp to go up to 25 per cent in the near future .'
p14871
aS'we were also aware that under the pressure of this campaign , the government machinery will be required to make a number of corrections on the policy front .'
p14872
aS'we are committed to make india an easy place to do business .'
p14873
aS'we want to present to the world the enormous opportunities that india offers as a base for manufacturing , design , research and development .'

p14878
aS'i encourage all of you to see for yourselves the direction that india is taking .'
p14879
aS'let me take this opportunity to share my thoughts .'
p14880
aS'in a years time , make in india has become the biggest brand that india has ever created .'
p14881
aS'both within and outside the country , it has captured the imagination of people , institutions , industries , media and the political leadership .'
p14882
aS'this is because : it reflects our collective desire to engage in productive activities ; - it also reflects the global need to produce things at lower cost .'
p14883
aS'- it is forcing us to make corrections and increase efficiency ; - it has emboldened us to integrate with the world on equal terms .'
p14884
aS'- let me give you some concrete examples of what we have done : today , india is perhaps the most open country for fdi .'
p14885
aS'most of the fdi sectors have been put on automatic approval route .'
p14886
aS'our fdi inflows have gone up by 48 per cent since the day my government came into office .'
p14887
aS'in fact , fdi inflow in december , 2015 was the highest ever in this country .'
p14888
aS'this is , at a time , when global fdi has fallen substantially .'
p14889
aS'we have carried out a number of corrections on the taxation front .'
p14890
aS'we have said that we will not resort to retrospective taxation .'
p14891
aS'and i repeat this commitment once again .'
p14892
aS'we are also swiftly working towards making our tax regime transparent , stable and predictable .'
p14893
aS'we have laid all round emphasis on ease of doing business .'
p14894
aS'in the manufacturing sector , we have taken decisive steps to simplify processes and rationalize provisions .'
p14895
aS'this includes licensing , cross-border trade , security and environmental clearances .'
p14896
aS'we have announced attractive schemes in several sectors including electronics and textiles .'
p14897
aS'we have made substantial policy corrections in the defence sector .'
p14898
aS'from licensing to offset regime and export regime , we have given what the defence industry was looking for .'
p14899
aS'smooth and transparent allocation of natural resources is another example .'
p14900
aS'the advantages from this are two-fold : on one hand the production of such resources has gone up .'
p14901
aS'on the other hand , the transparent regime that we have established provides a level playing field among users and stake-holders .'
p14902
aS'this year , we will record the highest ever coal production .'
p14903
aS'also , 2015 was the year when indias highest ever generation of electricity was recorded .'
p14904
aS'on the issue of safety of properties and rights , we have already enacted a law for fast tracking of arbitration proceedings .'
p14905
aS'we are establishing dedicated commercial courts and commercial divisions in high courts .'
p14906
aS'the formation of the company law tribunal is at the final stage .'
p14907
aS'soon we shall be putting in place an effective ipr policy and patent regime .'
p14908
aS'we hope to pass the bankruptcy law which has been tabled in parliament .'
p14909
aS'hence , on the front of policy and procedure , we have made our systems cleaner , simpler , pro-active and business friendly .'
p14910
aS'i believe in minimum government and maximum governance .'
p14911
aS'therefore , almost on a daily basis , we are trying to remove the bottlenecks that were affecting investments and growth .'
p14912
aS'it is good to see that changes and corrections are taking place not just at the level of the federal government but also at the state level .'
p14913
aS'states are now in healthy competition to provide ease of business and infrastructure linkages .'
p14914
aS'the results have been encouraging .'
p14915
aS'india has become the fastest growing large economy in the world .'
p14916
aS'we will end this fiscal year with well over seven per cent growth in gdp .'
p14917
aS'imf , world bank , oecd , adb and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days .'
p14918
aS'in 2014-15 , india contributed 12.'
p14919
aS'5 per cent of global growth .'
p14920
aS'its contribution to global growth is 68 per cent higher than its share of the world economy .'
p14921
aS'let me also mention some other indicators : india has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions .'
p14922
aS'- we have jumped twelve ranks in the latest global ranking by the world bank on ease of doing business .'
p14923
aS'- india has improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness , from fifteenth , to ninth .'

p14930
aS'we are particularly keen to scale up investments in next generation infrastructure .'
p14931
aS'this includes roads , ports , railways , airports , telecom , digital networks and clean energy .'
p14932
aS'we are also investing in our social , industrial and agricultural infrastructure to give better income and quality of life to our people .'
p14933
aS'so far , it was our implementation capacity that was the biggest bottleneck .'
p14934
aS'we have speeded up processes .'
p14935
aS'the result is faster turn-around of projects .'
p14936
aS'indias highest ever kilometers of new highway contracts awarded was in 2015 .'
p14937
aS'similarly , the increase in railway capital expenditure was the highest this year .'
p14938
aS'thus , whether it is physical or social infrastructure ; we are executing it much more efficiently than ever before .'
p14939

p14940
aS'to enhance financing , we are trying innovative ways .'
p14941

aS'this includes high-tech sectors and high-value areas like defence production .'
p15003
aS'i assure you that if you take one step ; we will walk two steps for you .'
p15004
aS'in a competitive world improving managerial and technological capacity is essential for survival and growth .'
p15005
aS'from space shuttles to pollution control ; from health to education ; from agriculture to services ; our young entrepreneurs and start-ups are showing us newer and faster ways for enterprise and delivery .'
p15006
aS'my government is committed to support them and tap their energy fully .'
p15007
aS'we want our youth to become job creators rather than job seekers .'
p15008
aS'that is why , we have launched the start up india campaign .'
p15009
aS'we are keen to find ways in which : our minds are able to empower the hands ; - our hands are able to master the machines ; - our machines are able to make the best ; - our products are able to beat the rest .'
p15010
aS'- make in india is a drive to fulfill unmet demands of the common man .'
p15011
aS'it is also an effort to engage and empower the unemployed .'
p15012
aS'i also emphasize on make for india ; so that human and sectoral needs can be fulfilled .'
p15013
aS'i have heard several global companies talk about their localization plans .'
p15014
aS'thus , this campaign has the capacity to boost the indian economy and also brighten the global scenario .'
p15015
aS'friends !'

p15023
aS'venkaiah ji has made my job easier ; now i dont have to spell the names .'
p15024
aS'he is never worried ; sometimes some names are left .'
p15025
aS'you heard the speech of venkaiah ji like super fast express .'
p15026
aS'a short while ago , raman singh ji was describing that modi ji has started on sunday which is a holiday .'
p15027
aS'for me it is holiday in real sense .'
p15028
aS'about holiday , i say its holy day .'
p15029
aS'we should do all the work that is possible on that day .'
p15030
aS'when i go to bed at night i would have completed my visit to five states today .'
p15031
aS'i left delhi , reached chhattisgarh , then i will go to odisha .'
p15032
aS'from odisha i will go to west bengal and then i will go to uttar pradesh .'
p15033
aS'when janta janardan assigns you some responsibility then you should try to complete it whole heartedly .'
p15034
aS'and everyone should try .'
p15035
aS'today , i had the opportunity to unveil the statue of sai baba .'
p15036
aS'the hospital provides free services to the poor , especially for the childrens heart surgery .'
p15037
aS'those who would have gone to puttaparthi must have seen the big hospital .'
p15038
aS'i would like to point out that less attention was paid to the social works done by sai baba while miracles were talked about more .'
p15039
aS'the work he had done in the area of water supply , education and health are indeed very inspiring .'
p15040
aS'even if we do not talk of any miracle , these works are miracles in themselves .'
p15041
aS'i do not talk of any miracle .'
p15042
aS'speaking of a miracle in itself is a huge miracle .'
p15043
aS'i salute the great social works of sai baba .'
p15044
aS'today the draft of a new policy was presented before you on innovation and entrepreneurship .'
p15045
aS'i congratulate raman singh and his government for their thinking in this direction .'
p15046
aS'it has a blueprint of what government can do , what government will do , what people should do and what people and government can do together .'
p15047
aS'if we look towards the countries which have progressed in past 50 year then we will find that at the core of their progress lies the innovation .'
p15048
aS'they brought about many new things .'
p15049
aS'they came out with several new ideas which wer later accepted by the world .'
p15050
aS'that innovation became beneficial for the society and became the reason behind economic progress of that country .'
p15051
aS'if there is no innovation , the nation comes to a halt .'
p15052
aS'it causes interruption .'
p15053
aS'the very nature of the life should be ever changing with times .'
p15054
aS'the tradition of innovation should be maintained .'
p15055
aS'we should work for new innovations which are useful to the society and community .'
p15056
aS'entrepreneurship , 65 percent of our population is youth .'
p15057
aS'the world is watching this demographic division as a major power .'
p15058
aS'however , if we continue to just recite the rosary of demographic division that our 65 percent population is below 35 years of age , then it is not going to work .'
p15059
aS'this 65 percent of population should be skilled .'
p15060
aS'there should be economic management for displaying skill .'
p15061
aS'the government policies should be encouraging these small entrepreneurs .'
p15062
aS'our youth should become job creator from job seeker .'
p15063
aS'he should work with dreams to provide job to other and not to look job for himself .'
p15064
aS'this could be the environment in the country .'
p15065
aS'the scheme formulated by the government emphasize on all these things .'
p15066
aS'simply being a graduate and move around looking for job with certificates could not be the life of youths of my country .'
p15067
aS'the environment of my country should be conducive to help realize the dreams of life for my youth .'
p15068
aS'the government has taken steps one after another in this direction to fulfill their dreams and ambitions .'
p15069
aS'skill development provides skilling opportunities to the youth of the country .'
p15070
aS'mudra yojna is financing scheme for new entrepreneurs and even for the old who want to expand .'
p15071
aS'remember this doesnt require any guarantee for such people who couldnt even go to the banks .'
p15072
aS'money lenders fleeced them .'
p15073
aS'the interest was enormous .'
p15074
aS'some time he had to flee from his village and at times to leave the world .'
p15075
aS'mudra scheme has been formulated to save him from the clutches of money lenders .'
p15076
aS'small people like washer man , hairdresser , pot seller , cloth seller , candle seller or common people when they needed 5-10 thousand rupees , they used to visit money lenders and in a way pledge themselves .'
p15077
aS'under the scheme , arrangements have been made to provide funds worth rs.'
p15078
aS'50,000 to 10 lakh without guarantee .'
p15079
aS'so far , 20 million people have been granted funds and almost one million billion rupees has been dispensed to them without seeking any form of guarantee .'
p15080
aS'the idea here is that they expand their businesses and provide employment to poor people .'
p15081
aS'they provide employment to one , two , four people and this is going to create job opportunities .'
p15082
aS'there is prevailing belief in the world that for economic growth the push will come from the private sector and the public sector entities like government psus or corporate houses .'
p15083
aS'for a country like india , yet another mode is required which is the personal sector .'
p15084
aS'private sector has its own relevance , public sector has its own importance but personal sector is the one where each individual becomes an entrepreneur .'
p15085
aS'the state has come with this policy today to give a fillip to entrepreneurship .'
p15086
aS'he should get finance from mudra yojna , get skill from skill development program and then an environment of positive market should be created .'
p15087
aS'im glad that of out of two billion people who received help , almost 70 percent are from scs , sts or obcs .'
p15088
aS'women entrepreneurs have also come forward in very large numbers .'
p15089
aS'the force being created and the policies which chattisgarh government has come up with together shall be of great value .'
p15090
aS'when central and state governments power unite , the development comes very rapidly .'
p15091
aS'and i believe that the youth of chhattisgarh will be benefited .'
p15092
aS'pradhan mantri aawas yojna is also being launched today .'
p15093
aS'after so many years of independence there are around five billion households who need housing facility .'
p15094
aS'nearly 20 million are in the cities and 30 million live in the villages .'
p15095
aS'these are the people for whom it is not possible to build a house on their own .'
p15096
aS'neither do they have land nor the money .'
p15097
aS'systems sometime play a big role for development .'
p15098
aS'poorest of the poor find a way of living .'
p15099
aS'he lives in the slums , goes out in the day time and comes back in night to sleep .'
p15100
aS'there is no environment for the family nor he has the dreams .'
p15101
aS'but if he is given a small house , he is willing to pay back .'
p15102
aS'if government and banks extend help , this model of public private partnership can move forward .'
p15103
aS'once he has the house , second thing comes to his mind .'
p15104
aS'if guests come , there should be something at the entrance to wipe the feet .'
p15105
aS'then he saves 10 rupees and gets a doormat .'
p15106
aS'the he thinks it was okay in slum but now when people come here , there should be carpet .'
p15107
aS'he then saves some money and purchases the carpet next month .'
p15108
aS'after sometime he thinks his children should study .'
p15109
aS'then he starts thinking for their education .'
p15110
aS'once the roof over the head comes , the walls come there , it breathes in a new life to his dreams and he starts doing new things .'
p15111
aS'hence i would like to point out that the pradhan mantri awas yojana is not an infrastructure .'
p15112
aS'it is not meant to create walls or to provide land .'
p15113
aS'it is a big program to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of the people .'
p15114
aS'even for the poorest of the poor in india and every individual , there is a desire to have his own house .'
p15115
aS'however , the desires of the poor are never fulfilled .'
p15116
aS'no poor wants to give poverty to their children in inheritance .'
p15117
aS'he also wants to give them something .'
p15118
aS'government has a dream for such people to help them fulfill their dreams .'
p15119
aS'it will be 75 years of indias independence in 2022 .'
p15120
aS'can every citizen of country , all the governments , all those who are thinkers in public or personal life , all of them should resolve that in 2022 when it will be 75 years of indias independence how can we give back to all those great men who laid down their lives for independence , spent their young days in jail , were hanged , sacrificed themselves and help us attain independence .'
p15121
aS'this should be resolve of every citizen of the country .'
p15122
aS'we should think what kind should be the nation of our dreams .'
p15123
aS'we should have a dream that on 75 years of independence , even the poorest of the poor of india should have a house of their own .'
p15124
aS'it is quite a task since 50 million households are to be created by 2022 .'
p15125
aS'lots of human resources will be required .'
p15126
aS'but it will also increase the employment opportunities .'
p15127
aS'cement , iron , brick , clay all will be sold more .'
p15128
aS'there will be more work for the workers .'
p15129
aS'we will be a witness to a major economic trend in coming days for the young generation .'
p15130
aS'life is going to change and that program starts here .'
p15131
aS'states governments across the country need to act fast and decide what would be the location of the land to build such housing units .'
p15132
aS'center is ready to pursue this work .'
p15133
aS'state and central government will do this work together and provide shelter to poorest of poor of this country .'
p15134
aS'his dreams will get a new life with this shelter .'
p15135
aS'and with those dreams the country will scale new heights in 2022 .'
p15136
aS'with this belief i once again convey my greetings to raman singh ji and his team .'
p15137
aS'sriman venkaiah ji is the minister of this department and is working day and night .'
p15138
aS'i believe that this dream shall come true .'
p15139
aa(lp15140
S'i congratulate rail minister suresh prabhu , on presenting a thoughtful budget for the dynamic railways of a progressive nation .'
p15141
aS'this budget strives for the dignity of the poor , honour of the women , enthusiasm of the youth and broadening the smile of the middle class .'
p15142
aS'this budget presents an optimistic strategy for the future , while giving a complete account of the promises made in the budget of previous year .'
p15143
aS'we have achieved a lot in the past one year and this budget presents an effort to make it further better .'
p15144
aS'cleanliness and upgradation of passenger facilities and technology remains the basic mantra of last two budgets .'
p15145
aS'beside this , railway projects have been defined on the basis of commissioning , in place of completion .'
p15146
aS'i believe this policy-transformation is a paradigm-shift in nations economy .'
p15147
aS'the special arrangement of the super-fast trains for the poor through launch of antodaya express and deen-dyalu rail coaches , reiterate the commitment of our government to the poor .'
p15148
aS'this budget will have long-term positive impact on the national economy by effective execution , enhanced capital investment and infusion of technology along with it , in the railways .'
p15149
aS'appropriate steps has been taken towards fulfilling the governments promise to enhance connectivity in the backward areas of the country , especially the north-east .'
p15150
aS'beside , the chronic problem of our rail routes due to the lack of capacity , has been done away with to a large extent over the past one year .'
p15151
aS'this rail budget has further strengthened the measures.'
p15152
ag1044
aS'we have seen the budgets before mr suresh prabhu .'
p15153
aS'i dont want to criticize those , but if i see the budgets of last five years by the previous government , the budget by suresh prabhuji has taken a big jump with 2.'
p15154
aS'5 times higher investment .'
p15155
aS'this budget will be an important tool towards the renovation of the nation .'
p15156
aS'the best thing is that the state governments are also enthusiastically participating in the expansion of our railways .'
p15157
aS'a detailed road-map in this direction has also been presented .'
p15158
aS'along with that an effort has been made to seek the co-operation of passengers and the railway employees , as well .'
p15159
aS'discipline in spending , efficiency in management and accountability to the consumer is the focus of our government , which is reflected in this budget .'

p15172
aS'two things have touched me especially .'
p15173
aS'first , all those who have written to me , have stuck to the subject .'
p15174
aS'second , thousands of people shared their views .'
p15175
aS'it is a reflection of how important the issue is .'
p15176
aS'we have restricted exams to school premises , students and parents .'
p15177
aS'large number of views shared on my app show that student related issues should be discussed continuously across the country .'
p15178
aS'in this edition of mann ki baat , i want to discuss something with students , parents and teachers .'
p15179
aS'i will share whatever i have heard , read and have been told .'
p15180
aS'i will also share my thoughts and i feel .'
p15181
aS'that 25-30 minutes discussion will be very useful for the students appearing in the exams .'
p15182
aS'my dear student friends , before i say something why not open this edition of mann ki baat with the batting maestro , sachin tendulkar .'
p15183
aS'lets find out what made him successful .'
p15184
aS'his experience will certainly help you .'
p15185
aS'i want you to listen to the message sent by the pride of indian youth and bharat ratna shri sachin tendulkar : namaskar , this is sachin tendulkar .'

p15190
aS'i just want to say you that you set targets for yourself and do not buckle under any pressure .'
p15191
aS'work hard and set a realistic and achievable target for yourself .'
p15192
aS'when i used to play cricket there were innumerable expectations from me also .'
p15193
aS'over the past 24 years , many difficult moments came .'
p15194
aS'some nice moments were there as well .'
p15195
aS'public expectation was always there and it increased with passage of time .'
p15196
aS'i found a way to deal with it .'
p15197
aS'i decided to set my own targets and to achieve them .'
p15198
aS'if i am setting my own targets and achieving them , then i am doing something good for the country .'
p15199
aS'i always tried to achieve those targets .'
p15200
aS'my focus was on the ball and targets were achieved automatically .'
p15201

p15209
aS'set targets for yourself with the free heart , free thinking and free capability .'
p15210
aS'i am sure that sachins advice will help you a lot .'
p15211
aS'and it is true ; why waste our time in competing with others ?'
p15212
aS'why not compete with ourselves ?'
p15213
aS'why not to try to break our own earlier records ?'
p15214
aS'you will see that nobody will be able to stop you from going forward .'
p15215
aS'you will not expect any praise from anyone when you will break your own record .'
p15216
aS'you will be satisfied internally .'
p15217
aS'friends , do not consider exams as a number game .'
p15218
aS'life should be linked with great purposes .'
p15219
aS'we should pursue our dreams and stay focused .'
p15220
aS'exams only tell us that whether we are treading on right path or not and with right pace or not .'
p15221
aS'therefore , if dreams are big , this exam will become enjoyable .'
p15222
aS'every exam is a step towards achieving that great purpose .'
p15223
aS'every success will become a key to achieve that great purpose .'
p15224
aS'therefore , do not limit yourself to what will happen in this years exam .'
p15225
aS'work with a much bigger purpose .'
p15226
aS'even if you fall short a little , you will not feel disappointed .'
p15227
aS'you will get more courage to achieve that purpose .'
p15228
aS'people have shared their views on my app .'
p15229
aS'one mr shrey gupta has emphasized that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body .'
p15230
aS'students should take care of their health also along with their studies .'
p15231
aS'so that you can write exams in a good health .'
p15232
aS'on this last day , i will not ask you to do exercise or run for 3 or 5 kilometers .'
p15233
aS'but what is your routine , especially during exams , is important .'
p15234
aS'during all 365 days , out routine should be according to our dreams and commitments .'
p15235
aS'i agree with what shri prabhakar reddy has said .'
p15236
aS'he has suggested that students should sleep on time and should do revision after getting up early .'
p15237
aS'students should reach examination centre before time with admit card and other essential things .'
p15238
aS'shri prabhakar reddy has said this and i may not have said this .'
p15239
aS'because i am little unconcerned regarding sleep .'
p15240
aS'my friends also keep telling me that i sleep very less .'
p15241
aS'i will try to do something about it .'
p15242
aS'but i definitely agree with this .'
p15243
aS'stipulated time to sleep , sound sleep are equally important as your other day-to-day activities .'
p15244
aS'and this is possible .'
p15245
aS'i am fortunate that i sleep less but it is very sound .'
p15246
aS'and it is enough too for me .'
p15247
aS'but i will request you .'
p15248
aS'some people have a habit of talking on phone for long time before sleeping and those thoughts occupy their mind , so how will they sleep ?'
p15249
aS'when i ask you to sleep , i am not asking to sleep only for exams .'
p15250
aS'to write well in exams , i am asking you to sleep tension-free .'
p15251
aS'i am not asking to keep on sleeping .'
p15252
aS'it shouldnt happen that when you score less and your mother asks the reason , you tell that modi ji asked me to sleep and i slept .'
p15253
aS'i hope you will not do that .'
p15254
aS'in life , discipline is a big reason behind strong foundation of successes .'
p15255
aS'discipline provides a strong foundation .'
p15256
aS'unorganized and undisciplined people , who complete days work in evening , think that they have done the job but so much of energy is wasted and there is tension every moment .'
p15257
aS'in our body also , even if one part is paining , the whole body does not feel comfortable .'
p15258
aS'not only that , our routine also gets disturbed .'
p15259
aS'any that is why ; we should not consider any thing small .'
p15260
aS'you should never compromise on your decisions .'
p15261
aS'decide and try to do it .'
p15262
aS'friends , i have seen two types of students who appear in exams .'
p15263
aS'one is who concentrates on his strengths and learning .'
p15264
aS'second types of students doubt their abilities and worry too much about their question paper .'
p15265
aS'you would have seen these two types of people .'
p15266
aS'concern about the paper has a negative impact on results too .'
p15267
aS'the one , who is confident about whatever he has learnt , is able to handle anything that comes up .'
p15268
aS'someone who can say this better than me is chess champion shri vishwanathan anand .'
p15269
aS'he will share his experiences and tell you how to check-mate in exams : hello , this is viswanathan anand .'
p15270
aS'first of all , let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams .'
p15271
aS'i will next talk a little bit about how i went to my exams and my experiences for that .'
p15272
aS'i found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life .'
p15273
aS'you need to be well rested , get a good nights sleep , you need to be on a full stomach , you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm .'
p15274
aS'it is very very similar to a game of chess .'
p15275
aS'when you play , you dont know , which pawn will appear , just like in a class you dont know , which question will appear in an exam .'
p15276
aS'so if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well , then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment .'
p15277
aS'so stay calm .'
p15278
aS'it is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself , dont keep your expectations too high .'
p15279
aS'just see it as a challenge do i remember what i was taught during the year , can i solve these problems .'
p15280
aS'at the last minute , just go over the most important things and the things you feel , the topics you feel , you dont remember very well .'
p15281
aS'you may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students ; while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter .'
p15282
aS'if you revise the questions you find difficult , you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam , you will be able to deal with them much better .'
p15283
aS'so stay calm , get a good nights sleep , dont be over-confident but dont be pessimistic either .'

p15286
aS'vishwanathan anand has really said a very important thing and you would also have seen him playing international matches with good health .'
p15287
aS'he plays with so much concentration and does not even move his eyes .'
p15288
aS'we used to hear about arjuna , how he used to concentrate on the birds eye .'
p15289
aS'similarly , vishwanathan anands eyes are fixed on target when he plays and that is expression of the inner peace .'
p15290
aS'it is difficult to say whether we will get inner peace just by someones words .'
p15291
aS'but we should strive for that , smilingly .'
p15292
aS'even during exams , if we smile and laugh , we will start experiencing the inner peace .'
p15293
aS'you cant have inner peace when you are not talking to friends , walking alone , trying to read so many books at the last moment .'
p15294
aS'laugh with your friends .'
p15295
aS'share jokes .'
p15296
aS'you will feel peaceful environment automatically .'
p15297
aS'i want to share a small thing with you .'
p15298
aS'just imagine , you are standing at a pond and you are getting a nice view of the water but suddenly if someone throws a stone in it .'
p15299
aS'now , the nice view which you were getting will not be there anymore .'
p15300
aS'if water is still , no matter how deep are the things they look clear .'
p15301
aS'but if water is not still , then nothing is visible inside .'
p15302
aS'there is a lot inside you , labour of the whole year .'
p15303
aS'but if your mind is not at peace , then you cant find that treasure .'
p15304
aS'if you have a peaceful mind , then you will be able to use your treasure of knowledge and exam will become very easy .'
p15305
aS'i want to tell you something about myself .'
p15306
aS'when i go to attend some lecture or in the government also , there are subjects i need to concentrate hard .'
p15307
aS'when i try to understand by concentrating more , then i feel an inner pressure .'
p15308
aS'then i realize that i need to relax a bit .'
p15309
aS'then i developed a technique of deep breathing and take 3-5 deep breaths .'
p15310
aS'it takes me around 30,40 or 50 seconds but then my mind becomes calm and ready to understand the matter .'
p15311
aS'this is my experience and may work for you too .'
p15312
aS'shri rajat aggarwl has written a good thing on my app .'
p15313
aS'he said , we should relax with friends , family for at least half an hour every day .'
p15314
aS'this is a very important thing said by shri rajat .'
p15315
aS'most of the times , when we come back from exam , we start calculating about right and wrong answers .'
p15316
aS'and if parents are educated and more so , if teachers , then they ask the exact answers .'
p15317
aS'they calculate whether you will score 40,80 or 90 marks .'
p15318
aS'your mind is still entangled in the exam that is already over .'
p15319
aS'you also share with friends about the answers .'
p15320
aS'we get entangled in that only .'
p15321
aS'friends , please do not do this .'
p15322
aS'once an exam is over , its over .'
p15323
aS'chat with your family on other subjects , remember old memories .'
p15324
aS'try to remember the scenes of a location you had visited with your parents .'
p15325
aS'spend half an hour on this .'
p15326
aS'what shri rajat has said is absolutely correct .'
p15327
aS'friends , what can i tell you about peace ?'
p15328
aS'today , before you take your exams , one such person has sent you his message , who himself is a teacher .'
p15329
aS'he teaches us the values of life .'
p15330
aS'by interpreting ram charit manas in present context , he teaches us values .'
p15331
aS'he is revered morari bapu , he has given some important tips for you .'
p15332
aS'he is a teacher and thinker also therefore his words have combination of both : i am morari bapu speaking .'
p15333
aS'my advice to all the students is that at the time of examination you unburden your mind and with a clear , calm and concentrated mind take the exam .'
p15334
aS'and then accept whatever situation comes .'
p15335
aS'my view is that by accepting the situation as it is , we can be more happy and peaceful .'
p15336
aS'take the exam with a light and calm mind , you will get sure success , you will not feel guilty if you fail and not feel arrogant if you succeed .'
p15337
aS'i end with a couplet it is not necessary everybody get success in this world , learn to live with failures .'

aS'i am grateful to revered morari bapu for his inspiring message .'
p15341
aS'friends , i want to talk about one issue .'
p15342
aS'in their responses , people have invariably mentioned about yoga .'
p15343
aS'it is a matter of satisfaction for me that when i meet people from different countries , a mention of yoga always comes , may be briefly .'
p15344
aS'i feel proud that there is so much curiosity about yoga .'
p15345
aS'how many people on my mobile app , shri atanu mandal , sri kunal gupta , shri shashank kumar , shri k g anand , shri abhijeet kulkarni , innumerable such people have referred to yoga and meditation .'
p15346
aS'i do not say that you start practicing yoga from tomorrow that will be injustice with you , however those who practice it should not stop it , just because of exams .'
p15347
aS'however , it is true that be it student life or latter part of life , yoga is an important key for the development of conscience .'
p15348
aS'and it is a key which is most accessible and simple .'
p15349
aS'you should definitely think about it .'
p15350
aS'if you search around you and find a yoga teacher , they can definitely suggest you few things which you can practice in few minutes and will benefit during exams .'
p15351
aS'see if you can .'
p15352
aS'i have great faith in it .'
p15353
aS'my young friends , you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall .'
p15354
aS'you want to take your seat quickly .'
p15355
aS'why do you do this in a hurry ?'
p15356
aS'why should not you manage your time in such a manner that if you are stuck in traffic , still you reach in time for exam .'
p15357
aS'otherwise , the hurry adds to the tension .'
p15358

p15359
aS'sometimes we think it is a waste of time , but it is not the case .'
p15360

p15361
aS'you will clearly know what is to be done and it will ensure that you do everything properly and you will not have to regret later .'
p15362

p15363
aS'so please read the instructions very carefully .'
p15364
aS'mr .'
p15365
aS'yash nagar has written on my app that when he saw the paper for the first time , it appeared very difficult .'
p15366
aS'however in the second look , it appeared easy to him .'
p15367
aS'questions were the same which he knew , only they were asked differently .'
p15368
aS'it is very essential to understand the question .'
p15369
aS'sometime when we do not understand the question properly , they appear difficult to us .'
p15370
aS'i emphasize this view of yash nagar .'
p15371
aS'read the question several times and try to match your knowledge with them .'
p15372
aS'you will see that the question will appear easy even before you attempt it .'
p15373
aS'it is a matter of great happiness to me today that bharat ratna and renowned scientist professor cnr rao has stressed upon patience .'

p15393
aS'for which i take half an hour , he took only 3 minutes to communicate .'
p15394
aS'this is the strength of science and a scientific mind .'
p15395

p15396
aS'what he has highlighted are the qualities of dedication , determination , diligence .'
p15397
aS'remain steadfast friends , if you do not give up , fear will run away .'
p15398
aS'for achieving good things , a bright future awaits you .'
p15399
aS'in my app , ruchika dabas has sent a message , sharing her exam experience .'
p15400
aS'she said that in her family , there is a conscious effort to create a positive environment during examinations .'
p15401
aS'similar efforts were made in her neighboring families too .'
p15402
aS'and this was emphasized by mr sachin tendulkar also that positive approach , positive frame of mind gives rise to positive energy .'
p15403
aS'sometimes many things happen , which inspire us .'
p15404
aS'and please dont think that they help only students .'
p15405
aS'in every phase of life , good examples , given us strength , inspiration and show us the way out of troubles .'
p15406
aS'we all have read about thomas alva edison , the inventor of electric bulb .'
p15407
aS'have you ever thought how many years he devoted to achieve this feat ?'
p15408
aS'how many times he faced failures , how much time was wasted , how much money was spent how much frustration he must have felt , due to repeated failures ?'
p15409
aS'but today , the electric bulb is illuminating our lives .'
p15410
aS'that is why it is said that seeds of success are inherent within failures .'
p15411
aS'who doesnt know srinivas ramanujam ?'
p15412
aS'one of the greatest mathematical minds of the modern world .'
p15413
aS'you must be knowing that he did not have any formal training in mathematics .'
p15414
aS'still , he made great contribution towards fields of mathematical analogies and number theory .'
p15415
aS'his was a life filled with pain and sorrow ; still he made a great contribution to the world .'
p15416
aS'jk rowling is a brilliant example of the fact that anybody can achieve success anytime .'
p15417
aS'harry potter series is now popular all over the world but it was not the case in the beginning .'
p15418
aS'imagine , how many difficulties she had to face , how many failures ?'
p15419
aS'rowling herself has said that it the times of crisis she used to focus her entire energy on the job which was most meaningful for her .'
p15420
aS'nowadays , exams are not merely for the students , but they are a test of family , teachers and schools as well .'
p15421
aS'however , without the support system of parents and teachers , it is difficult for a student to cope up alone .'
p15422
aS'if students , parents , teachers and even seniors work as a team and proceed in a planned manner , examinations become easier .'
p15423
aS'mr .'
p15424
aS'keshav vaishnav has written on my app , he has complained that parents must never pressurize their children for more marks .'
p15425
aS'they should merely encourage them to prepare and should be concerned about keeping them relaxed .'
p15426
aS'vijay jindal writes that our own expectations must never be imposed on children .'
p15427

p15433
aS'our lives have significantly changed from the previous generations .'
p15434
aS'we are witnessing every moment , a new innovation , new technology and a new face of science .'
p15435
aS'the best part is we are not merely dazzled by all this ; rather we want to move ahead in tandem with the pace of science .'
p15436
aS'i am highlighting these point because it is the national science day today .'
p15437
aS'every year we celebrate it as the national festival of science .'
p15438
aS'on february 28 , 1928 , sir cv raman has announced his famous discovery , the raman effect for which he won the nobel prize .'
p15439
aS'therefore , the country celebrates february 28 as national science day .'
p15440
aS'curiosity is the mother of science .'
p15441
aS'every mind should have scientific temper and the quest for science .'
p15442
aS'each generation will have to emphasize on the innovation .'
p15443
aS'and innovation is not possible without science and technology .'
p15444
aS'on national science day , let us resolve to make science and technology as an essential part of our lives .'
p15445
aS'this year , the theme on the national science day is make in india , science and technology driven innovations .'
p15446
aS'i bow to sir cv raman and appeal to all of you to inculcate scientific temper .'
p15447
aS'friends , sometimes success comes very late and when the person is successful , his views about the world also changes .'
p15448
aS'you may have been busy preparing for exams and some news events might not have registered in your minds .'
p15449
aS'still i want to repeat a story which you must have heard recently , that a great discovery has been made in the life of science .'
p15450
aS'scientists of the world worked relentlessly , several generations of them contributed including our own scientists who discovered the gravitational waves .'
p15451
aS'it is a very far reaching achievement in the field of science .'
p15452
aS'the discovery not only proves the theory of albert einstein , but also is quantum jump for physics .'
p15453
aS'this is indeed a great achievement for the entire mankind and also a matter of great pride for us since many indians were involved in this discovery .'
p15454
aS'i want to extend my heartiest congratulations to all these scientist .'
p15455
aS'in future too our scientists will work towards consolidating such gains and in all other international scientific endeavors .'
p15456
aS'we have recently taken an important decision to set up laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) in india .'
p15457
aS'there are only two such laboratories in the world and india will be the third country .'
p15458
aS'the process will gather momentum with the involvement of india .'
p15459
aS'despite its meager resources , india will definitely be an active partner in the endeavor of great importance for the mankind .'

p15475
aa(lp15476
S'my heartfelt thanks to finance minister sri arun jaitley ji for this budget .'
p15477
aS'our focus is on the villages , poor , farmers , women and the youth .'
p15478
aS'the budget has plans for ambitious schemes to bring in a qualitative change in their lives .'
p15479
aS'this budget presents a comprehensive , time bound action plan for poverty alleviation .'
p15480
aS'several measures have been outlined to double the income of the farmers .'
p15481
aS'pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana is one of them where a substantial allocation has been made to ensure water to every farm .'
p15482
aS'all of us know the importance of power and road infrastructure .'
p15483
aS'there is a vision in this budget to connect every village to road by 2019 .'
p15484
aS'pradhan mantri gram sadak yojana has been allocated substantial funds to connect the rural india by roads .'
p15485
aS'besides there is a clear plan to provide electricity to every village by 2018 .'
p15486
aS'it will give an impetus to rural economy and bring about positive changes .'
p15487
aS'if you ask a poor man , he will clearly share his dream .'
p15488
aS'owning a house is his biggest dream .'
p15489
aS'everyone from a middle class or neo middle class wants to own a house .'
p15490
aS'how are we going to help them realize this dream ?'
p15491
aS'this is not possible without the help of the government .'
p15492
aS'thats why provisions have been made this time to give impetus to the housing sector and ensure a house to general household .'
p15493
aS'people who are living in rented house have also got increased rebate in income tax over house rent .'
p15494
aS'those who are earning up to 5 lakhs will have to pay lesser tax .'
p15495
aS'there has been a lot of politics over the poor .'
p15496
aS'you will be amazed to know that if a poor lady who cooks food for her children using a chulha faces adverse impact on her and her childrens health .'
p15497
aS'experts say that the smoke of that chulha , is equivalent to the smoke of 400 cigarettes per day .'
p15498
aS'we have to help people below the poverty line and thats why we have decided to provide free gas connection to such people .'
p15499
aS'5 crore families who use chulha for cooking will get freedom from smoke .'
p15500
aS'poor will get health benefits and environment will protected as well .'
p15501
aS'our government is also taking important decisions in health sector .'
p15502
aS'at times , an ailment can destroy life of a poor family or a middle class family or a neo middle class family .'
p15503
aS'we have presented schemes for senior citizens who are in dire need of help .'
p15504
aS'our country should be safe , our citizens should feel safe and our forces should be equipped with modern defence equipment and our soldiers should get one rank one pension post retirement .'
p15505
aS'this budget has made provisions for boosting defence manufacturing and providing the armed forces with modern and potent equipment .'
p15506
aS'you might have seen that in infrastructure a provision of more than 2 lakh crore rupees has been made .'
p15507
aS'this will benefit our forces who are guarding our borders .'
p15508
aS'the youth of the country is moving ahead .'
p15509
aS'in order to provide him employment opportunities we are going to come out with two new initiatives , formalizing the informal and employing the unemployed .'
p15510
aS'my mantra is start up india , stand up india .'
p15511
aS'to provide a favorable ecosystem for startups , the budget has provided plans in the taxes .'
p15512
aS'our dalit and tribal youth now wants to become an entrepreneur .'
p15513
aS'he doesnt want to be job seeker anymore but a job creator .'
p15514
aS'in order to make him realize his dream , the government has decided to establish an entrepreneurial hub .'
p15515
aS'the youth of the country should be able to face global challenges and should get opportunities in education .'
p15516
aS'but due to archaic laws and regulations , education has suffered a lot and in order to improve it 10 public and 10 private institutions will be raised to global standards after selection through a challenge route .'
p15517
aS'these institutes will be provided financial aid as well .'
p15518
aS'this is a great initiative in educations sector .'
p15519
aS'once there will be an environment of competition among higher education institutes , you can imagine what impact will it bring .'
p15520
aS'primary education is equally important .'
p15521
aS'till now , the governments have been focusing on expansions of primary education which was also important but in order to combat todays challenges qualitative change is also required with expansion .'
p15522
aS'children in far flung villages should get education , they should get qualitative education , this is our focus .'
p15523
aS'and this budget presents priorities to such qualitative issues .'
p15524
aS'our government has always stood for having faith in our people .'
p15525
aS'we should not doubt our countrys citizens .'
p15526
aS'income tax department officials should also have a sense of respect towards our public and thats why a common citizen should be made free from complicated processes that he faces .'
p15527
aS'traders and professionals who are facing such problems should be made free from it .'
p15528
aS'a common man who earns livelihood will be free from processes involving presumptive tax payment on turn over .'
p15529
aS'once again , i congratulate shri arun jaitley ji and i assure my countrymen that this budget is a budget of your dreams .'
p15530

aS'chief justice of india , other dignitaries on the dais , judicial minds from india and abroad invitees , delegates , ladies and gentlemen !'
p15534
aS'i am delighted to address the international workshop on rule of law and sustainable development .'
p15535
aS'i welcome our friends from abroad and thank them for their active participation .'
p15536
aS'this workshop is being organized soon after two important international agreements which happened during 2015 .'
p15537
aS'one is the paris agreement on climate change .'
p15538
aS'the other is the agreement on sustainable development goals .'
p15539
aS'therefore , this conference provides a timely and useful opportunity to discuss the way forward .'
p15540
aS'this is important not only in the national context but also in the global context .'
p15541
aS'i hope you will keep in mind the welfare of mankind and the concerns of the international community in your deliberations .'
p15542
aS'the role of rules and laws in achieving sustainable development goals is going to be very important in the days to come .'
p15543
aS'however , rules should be such that they facilitate the achievement of these goals .'
p15544
aS'unfortunately , some times , the concern for environment is defined narrowly .'
p15545
aS'we all have to realize that if there is conflict , no ones purpose will be served .'
p15546
aS'i hope that you will show us the way to build and ensure climate justice across the globe based on legal as well as social frameworks .'
p15547
aS'last year , in september , i attended the meeting of the un general assembly where the sustainable development goals for 2030 were adopted .'
p15548
aS'these goals reflect our evolving understanding of the social , economic and environmental linkages that define our lives .'
p15549
aS'this was followed by the cop-21 where we contributed significantly in shaping the narrative .'
p15550
aS'our commitments at cop-21 underline the indian ethos which aims at changing human lifestyle along with changes in the manner in which we engage in economic activity .'
p15551
aS'the problems of environment are largely the effect of our consumptive lifestyles .'
p15552
aS'if we want to make a meaningful impact , we all need to look within ; before we read the books of law .'
p15553
aS'friends !'
p15554
aS'i have always felt that anything which is not sustainable can not be called development .'
p15555
aS'in our culture , development means , , and .'
p15556
aS'this can not happen unless the development process is inclusive and sustainable .'
p15557
aS'anything which compromises on the ability of future generations to meet their requirements can not be called development .'
p15558
aS'we in india have always believed in sustainability .'
p15559
aS'for us , the law of nature holds great value .'
p15560
aS'if we all observe it , then many man-made laws will not be required .'
p15561
aS'only the practice of and will be enough to help us .'
p15562
aS'in modern terminology , there is a word called stakeholder .'
p15563
aS'a path becomes sustainable , if all stakeholders are benefitted .'
p15564
aS'however , i must add a word of caution here .'
p15565
aS'the stake should be natural .'
p15566
aS'it should be inherent .'
p15567
aS'it can not be stretched to include those who may be working with ulterior motives .'
p15568
aS'nature is pure .'
p15569
aS'hence , only pure intentions can keep it intact .'
p15570
aS'we , in india , have a strong tradition of living in harmony with nature .'
p15571
aS'we worship nature .'
p15572
aS'we worship the sun , the moon , rivers , land , trees , animals , rain , air and fire .'
p15573
aS'these elements of nature have been given the stature of gods in our culture .'
p15574
aS'moreover , in indian mythology , most of the gods and goddesses are associated with an animal and a tree .'
p15575
aS'thus , respect for nature is an integral part of our culture , and has been passed across generations .'
p15576
aS'protection of environment comes naturally to us .'
p15577
aS'this strong tradition has been a guiding principle for all of us .'
p15578
aS'there is a well-known sanskrit saying : which means : we always pray for welfare , peace , fulfillment and sustainability of all ; at all places and for all times .'
p15579
aS'this is our commitment ; not of today but since time immemorial .'
p15580
aS'if we remember this , follow this and act accordingly , india could provide leadership in sustainable development .'
p15581
aS'for example , the practice of yoga is aimed at balancing contentment and worldly desires , to lead to a path of moderation and sustainable lifestyle .'
p15582
aS'when i talk of yoga , it is not just its physical dimension .'
p15583
aS'yoga is very comprehensive .'
p15584
aS'the ideas of yam , niyam , pratyahar teach us discipline , austerity and control .'
p15585
aS'much before the debate on sustainable development began , mahatma gandhi , the father of our nation , had said that we should act as trustees and use natural resources wisely .'
p15586
aS'it is our moral responsibility to ensure that we leave a healthy planet for future generations .'
p15587
aS'friends !'
p15588
aS'i am sure all of us agree that poverty is the biggest challenge for environment .'
p15589
aS'therefore , eradication of poverty is one of the fundamental goals of my government .'
p15590
aS'guided by our core values , we are working towards achieving this goal with sincerity .'
p15591
aS'we want to ensure a conducive environment for 1.'
p15592
aS'25 billion indians to develop , and prosper .'
p15593
aS'we are encouraging education , skill development , digital connectivity and entrepreneurship to provide an enabling ecosystem for our youth to blossom .'
p15594
aS'we aim to do all this in a sustainable manner .'
p15595
aS'we realize that fulfilling the demand for energy is vital to the achievement of our development goals .'
p15596
aS'this is why , one of the first challenges that we took up was generation of 175 giga watts of renewable energy .'
p15597
aS'we are well on our way to achieving this objective .'
p15598
aS'we have also taken up the swacch bharat and clean ganga initiatives .'
p15599
aS'i am happy to note that millions of people across the country have joined the cleanliness drive .'
p15600
aS'i take this opportunity to invite the participants to explore as to how we can strengthen this collective endeavour .'
p15601
aS'i am glad to learn that this workshop will also discuss issues related to pollution and waste management .'
p15602
aS'these are issues that need to be addressed proactively .'
p15603
aS'i look forward to your recommendations towards strengthening such initiatives .'
p15604
aS'friends !'
p15605
aS'the problems we face in india today are not unique .'
p15606
aS'other civilizations have also faced similar problems and were able to overcome them .'
p15607
aS'i believe that through our collective efforts we will succeed as well .'
p15608
aS'while doing so , we must ensure that we avoid contradictions between our need to develop and develop sustainably .'
p15609
aS'our culture teaches us union between the and .'
p15610
aS'if we become one with the universal order , there are no conflicts of interest .'
p15611
aS'therefore , my government is treating the challenge of adapting to climate change as an opportunity rather than a problem .'
p15612
aS'we need to adopt the philosophy of : .'
p15613
aS'we must do things in a way that causes minimum damage to the environment .'
p15614
aS'this is or mastery .'
p15615
aS'this is what i mean when i talk of zero defect and zero effect manufacturing .'
p15616
aS'i have written some of my thoughts on this theme in my book , convenient action : continuity for change .'
p15617
aS'friends !'
p15618
aS'the rule of law dictates that no one can be punished for anothers misdeed .'
p15619
aS'we need to recognize that there are many people who are least responsible for the problem of climate change .'
p15620
aS'they are also the people who still wait for access to modern amenities .'
p15621
aS'they face the adverse impact of climate change more than anyone else .'
p15622
aS'this includes cyclones , droughts , floods , heat waves , and rising sea levels .'
p15623
aS'the poor , vulnerable and marginalized groups have fewer resources to cope with climate disasters .'
p15624
aS'unfortunately , their present and future generations are also burdened by laws and agreements on environment .'
p15625
aS'that is why i talk about climate justice .'
p15626
aS'moreover , the rules , laws , practices and principles of one country can not be applied to another uniformly .'
p15627
aS'every country has its own challenges and its own ways of dealing with them .'
p15628
aS'if we apply the same set of rules for all countries and for all people ; it will not work .'
p15629
aS'sustainable development is our responsibility .'
p15630
aS'i am confident that we can achieve it , collectively .'
p15631
aS'i am also confident that we can find ways for development which are in harmony with nature .'
p15632
aS'we can find them along the road travelled by our forefathers .'
p15633
aS'i hope the deliberations during this workshop will help in developing a shared understanding of these imperatives .'
p15634
aS'i wish this conference a grand success .'
p15635
aS'thank you .'
p15636
aa(lp15637
S'madam lagarde , my cabinet colleague shri jaitley , ladies and gentlemen , i warmly welcome you all to india and to delhi .'
p15638
aS'delhi is a city with a rich heritage , and has several historical landmarks .'
p15639
aS'i hope you will have time to see some of them .'
p15640
aS'i am very happy that the imf has collaborated with us in organizing this conference .'
p15641
aS'madam lagarde , this event is another example of your fondness for india and asia .'
p15642
aS'i congratulate you on being appointed as managing director for a second term .'
p15643
aS'this reflects the confidence the world has in your understanding of the global economy , and your ability to lead this institution .'
p15644
aS'madam lagarde , the long pending quota revisions agreed in 2010 have finally come into effect .'
p15645
aS'the quotas of emerging countries will now better reflect their weight in the world economy .'
p15646
aS'this will give them more say in collective decisions in the imf .'
p15647
aS'you have demonstrated exceptional leadership , in managing the tensions that emerged due to the delay .'
p15648
aS'you played a major role in finally persuading all members to ratify the decisions taken in 2010.'
p15649
aS'i am sure , the imf will be able to build on this success .'
p15650
aS'reform of global institutions has to be an on-going process .'
p15651
aS'it must reflect changes in the global economy , and the rising share of emerging economies .'
p15652
aS'even now , imf quotas do not reflect the global economic realities .'
p15653
aS'change in quotas is not an issue of increasing the power of certain countries .'
p15654
aS'it is an issue of fairness and legitimacy .'
p15655
aS'the belief that quotas can be changed , is essential for the fairness of the system .'
p15656
aS'for poor nations to respect the legitimacy of such institutions , they must be able to aspire and to hope .'
p15657
aS'i am , therefore , very happy that the imf has decided to finalize the next round of quota changes by october 2017 .'
p15658
aS'india has always had great faith in multi-lateralism .'
p15659
aS'we believe that as the world becomes more complex , the role of multilateral institutions will increase .'
p15660
aS'some of you may not be aware that india was represented at the bretton woods conference in 1944 , which gave birth to the imf .'
p15661
aS'indias delegate was mr r .'
p15662
aS'k.'
p15663
aS'shanmukham chetty , who later became independent indias first finance minister .'
p15664
aS'our ties , therefore , are more than seventy years old .'
p15665
aS'we are a founding member of the asian infrastructure investment bank and the new development bank .'
p15666
aS'we are confident that these banks will play an important role in the development of asia .'
p15667
aS'the fund has built up an immense stock of economic expertise .'
p15668
aS'all its members should take advantage of this .'
p15669
aS'all of us need to pursue policies that provide a stable macro economy , enhance growth and further inclusion .'
p15670
aS'the fund can be of great assistance in this .'
p15671
aS'apart from advice , the imf can help in building capacity for policy making .'
p15672
aS'i am happy to announce a new partnership with bangladesh , bhutan , maldives , nepal , sri lanka , india and the imf .'
p15673
aS'we have agreed to set up the south asia regional training and technical assistance centre .'
p15674
aS'the centre will provide training to government and public sector employees .'
p15675
aS'it will enhance their skills and improve the quality of their policy inputs .'
p15676
aS'it will also provide technical assistance to governments and public institutions .'
p15677
aS'let me now turn to the theme of this conference .'
p15678
aS'i will touch on two issues : firstly , why asia ?'
p15679
aS'and secondly , how india ?'
p15680
aS'why is asia so important , and how can india contribute ?'
p15681
aS'many knowledgeable people have said that the twenty first century is , and will be , the asian century .'
p15682
aS'three out of every five people in the world live in asia .'
p15683
aS'its share in global output and trade is now close to one-third .'
p15684
aS'its share in global foreign direct investment is about forty percent .'
p15685
aS'it has also been one of the worlds most dynamic regions .'
p15686
aS'although asia has slowed down , it is still growing at a rate three times greater than that of the advanced countries .'
p15687
aS'it is , therefore , the ray of hope for global economic recovery .'
p15688
aS'when we think about asia , we must recognize that it is distinct in many ways .'
p15689
aS'for example , the theme of this conference is investing for the future .'
p15690
aS'asian families tend naturally to save more than people in other parts of the world .'
p15691
aS'thus they invest for the future .'
p15692
aS'economists have commented on the savings ethic of asian countries .'
p15693
aS'asians tend to save to buy a house , rather than borrow to buy a house .'
p15694
aS'many asian countries have relied more on developmental financial institutions and banks than on capital markets .'
p15695
aS'this provides an alternative model for the financial sector .'
p15696
aS'social stability built on strong family values is another feature of asias development .'
p15697
aS'asians tend to leave things behind for the next generation .'
p15698
aS'madam lagarde , you are one of the worlds top women leaders .'
p15699
aS'you will be interested in another unique feature of asia which is rarely commented upon : which is , the large number of women leaders .'
p15700
aS'india , sri lanka , bangladesh , pakistan , indonesia , thailand , korea , myanmar , and philippines : all of these countries have had women as national leaders .'
p15701
aS'asia has done so to a much greater degree than other continents .'
p15702
aS'today , four large states of india west bengal , tamil nadu , gujarat and rajasthan are headed by democratically elected women .'
p15703
aS'the speaker of the lower house of parliament in india is also a woman .'
p15704
aS'india has a special place in asia .'
p15705
aS'it has historically contributed to asia in several ways .'
p15706
aS'buddhism spread to china , japan , and other parts of south east asia from india .'
p15707
aS'it has had a lasting influence on the continents culture .'
p15708
aS'kingdoms in the south and west of india have engaged in maritime trade with other parts of asia for over a thousand years .'
p15709
aS'the indian national movement showed other asian countries that freedom from colonial rule could be achieved without violence .'
p15710
aS'it also demonstrated clearly that the sense of nationhood , could be broad and inclusive .'
p15711
aS'it need not be defined by narrow linguistic or religious identities .'
p15712
aS'the sanskrit saying vasudhaiva kutumbakam the world is one family - refers to this sense of the oneness of all identities .'
p15713
aS'india has dispelled the myth that democracy and rapid economic growth can not go together .'
p15714
aS'indias growth rate of over seven per cent is being achieved in a country that is also a vibrant democracy .'
p15715
aS'it is sometimes assumed that democracy is a colonial gift to india .'
p15716
aS'but historians tell us that india had produced forms of democratic self governance , many centuries ago , when democracy was unknown in many parts of the world .'
p15717
aS'india has also shown that a large , diverse country can be managed in a way that can promote economic growth and maintain social stability .'
p15718
aS'one way in which we are doing this is through cooperative and competitive federalism .'
p15719
aS'the states and the centre come together to pursue common objectives .'
p15720
aS'states which pursue good policies and deliver essential services for the poor , induce others to follow .'
p15721
aS'our rapid economic growth is also very distinct in asia .'
p15722
aS'we have never tried to gain in trade at the expense of our partners .'
p15723
aS'we do not follow beggar thy neighbour macro-economic policies .'
p15724
aS'we have never undervalued our exchange rate .'
p15725
aS'we add to world and asian demand by running current account deficits .'
p15726
aS'we are therefore good asian and good global economic citizens , and a source of demand to our trading partners .'
p15727
aS'we all want asia to succeed .'
p15728
aS'i firmly believe that india can contribute to asian prosperity and development by being economically strong .'
p15729
aS'amid global problems , i am happy to say that india is a haven of macro-economic stability and a beacon of hope , dynamism and opportunity .'
p15730
aS'madam lagarde , you have referred to india as the bright spot in the global economy .'
p15731
aS'i view this as a great privilege and , at the same time , a major responsibility .'
p15732
aS'let me outline our achievements in the last few months and our priorities for the period ahead .'
p15733
aS'we have achieved major gains in macro-economic stability .'
p15734
aS'a durable reduction in inflation , steady fiscal consolidation , a comfortable balance of payments position and build-up of foreign exchange reserves are the highlights .'
p15735
aS'in a difficult external environment and despite a second successive year of weak rainfall , we have increased our growth rate to 7.'
p15736
aS'6 per cent , the highest among major economies in the world .'
p15737
aS'we have improved our economic governance .'
p15738
aS'corruption and interference in the decisions of banks and regulators are now behind us .'
p15739
aS'we undertook a highly successful financial inclusion programme , bringing over two hundred million unbanked people into the banking system within a span of a few months .'
p15740
aS'thanks to our financial inclusion programme , we now have the worlds largest and most successful programme of direct benefit transfers , in cooking gas .'
p15741
aS'we plan to extend it to other sectors such as food , kerosene , and fertilizers .'
p15742
aS'this has improved targeting and the quality of public expenditure .'
p15743
aS'we have opened up nearly all sectors of our economy to fdi .'
p15744
aS'india achieved the highest ever rank in the world bank doing business indicators in 2015 .'
p15745
aS'india reached an all-time high in many physical indicators in 2015 , including the production of coal , electricity , urea , fertilizer and motor vehicles ; cargo handled at major ports and the fastest turnaround time in ports ; award of new highway kilometers ; software export ; entrepreneurship is booming , following a series of steps we have taken .'
p15746
aS'india is now fourth in the world in the number of technical start-ups , after usa , britain and israel .'
p15747
aS'the economist magazine has called india the new frontier for e-commerce .'
p15748
aS'we do not intend to rest on these achievements because my agenda of reform-to-transform still needs to be finished .'
p15749
aS'our recent budget provides a roadmap for our future plans and ambitions .'
p15750
aS'our underlying philosophy is clear : to create the climate for wealth generation and for that wealth to be spread to all indians , especially the poor , vulnerable , farmers , and disadvantaged communities .'
p15751
aS'we have increased investment in the rural and agriculture sector , because that is where a majority of india still lives .'
p15752
aS'but our help to the farmers is not based on giving hand-outs .'
p15753
aS'we aim to double farmer incomes by : - increasing irrigation , - better water management , - creating rural assets , - boosting productivity , - improving marketing , - reducing margins of middlemen , - and avoiding income shocks .'
p15754
aS'we are introducing reforms in agricultural marketing and have launched a major crop insurance programme .'
p15755
aS'in addition to agriculture , we have increased public investment in roads and railways .'
p15756
aS'this will improve the productivity of the economy and the connectivity of our people .'
p15757
aS'public investment is also essential at a time when private investment remains weak .'
p15758
aS'we have also made other reforms that will help create wealth and economic opportunity .'
p15759
aS'given the enormous entrepreneurial potential in the country , my motto is start up india and stand up india .'
p15760
aS'the budget has provided a further boost to the ecosystem for start-ups .'
p15761
aS'ensuring employability of the youth is essential for the success of our make-in-india campaign .'
p15762
aS'the government of india has an ambitious agenda for skilling our labour force .'
p15763
aS'skill creation of the magnitude that we have envisaged , involves institution building , which we have undertaken .'
p15764
aS'now , we have a skill development programme that cuts across twenty-nine sectors and with a nation-wide coverage .'
p15765
aS'india is a responsible global citizen in protecting the planet .'
p15766
aS'india played a positive role at the cop 21 summit .'
p15767
aS'between now and 2030 , we intend to re-write history by growing rapidly and also reducing the emission intensity of our gdp by thirty-three per cent .'
p15768
aS'by then , forty per cent of our installed electric power capacity will be from non-fossil fuel .'
p15769
aS'we will build an additional carbon sink of over 2.'
p15770
aS'5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 , by creating additional forest and tree cover .'
p15771
aS'these initiatives are from a country with very low per capita land availability and a low base of per capita emission .'
p15772
aS'we have taken the lead in launching an international solar alliance , involving 121 solar-resource rich countries falling between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn .'
p15773
aS'this will help many developing countries , including those in asia , to take advantage of developments in renewable energy .'
p15774
aS'india has moved from a regime of significant carbon subsidy to one of carbon taxes .'
p15775
aS'india is one of the few countries to have a carbon tax in the form of a cess on coal .'
p15776
aS'the coal cess has been doubled in the budget of 2016-17 .'
p15777
aS'india has a number of cooperative initiatives in asia .'
p15778
aS'we are transforming the look east policy , into an act east policy .'
p15779
aS'our approach to cooperation is based on flexible geometry .'
p15780
aS'we have integrated in different ways and at different speeds with our neighbours in south asia , our partners in asean , and our partners in singapore , japan , and korea .'
p15781
aS'we intend to continue doing so .'
p15782
aS'my dream is of a transformed india .'
p15783
aS'i lay this dream alongside our common dream of an advanced asia an asia where more than half of the global population can live with happiness and fulfillment .'
p15784
aS'our joint heritage and mutual respect , our common goals and similar policies , can and must create sustainable growth and shared prosperity .'
p15785
aS'once again , i welcome you all to india .'
p15786
aS'i wish the conference all success .'
p15787
aS'thank you .'

S'syed mohammad ashraf , founder president , all india ulama and mashaik board shawki ibrahim abdel karim allam , grand mufti of egypt , shaykh hashimuddin al gailani , from baghdad syed minhaj ur rehman from bangladesh diwan ahmed masood chisti from pakistan syed nizami from nizamuddin dargah and syed chisti from ajmer sharif my ministerial colleagues , scholars and sufis from india our guests from our neighbours and from nations far beyond , welcome to a land that is a timeless fountain of peace , and an ancient source of traditions and faiths , which has received and nurtured religions from the world .'
p15790
aS'welcome to a people with an abiding belief in vasudhaiva kutumbakam , the world is one family .'
p15791
aS'a belief in harmony with the message of holy quran that mankind were one community , then they differed among themselves , a creed echoed in the words of the great persian sufi poet saadi , written in the united nations , that human beings come from the same source : we are one family .'
p15792
aS'welcome to the ancient city of delhi - built by the genius of diverse peoples , cultures and faiths .'
p15793
aS'like our nation , the citys heart has place for every faith , from those with few followers to those with billion believers .'
p15794
aS'its magnificent shrines include the dargahs of great sufi saints mehboob-e-ilahi and hazrat bakhtiyar kaki , that draw people from all faiths and all corners of the world .'
p15795
aS'this is an extraordinary event of great importance to the world , at a critical time for humanity .'
p15796
aS'at a time when the dark shadow of violence is becoming longer , you are the noor , or the light of hope .'
p15797
aS'when young laughter is silenced by guns on the streets , you are the voice that heals .'
p15798
aS'in a world that struggles to assemble for peace and justice , this is an assembly of those whose life itself is a message of peace , tolerance and love .'
p15799
aS'you have come from different lands and cultures , but you are united by a common faith .'
p15800
aS'you speak different languages , but they blend together in a message of harmony .'
p15801
aS'and , you represent the rich diversity of the islamic civilization that stands on the solid bedrock of a great religion .'
p15802
aS'it is a civilization that reached great heights by the 15th century in science , medicine , literature , art , architecture and commerce .'
p15803
aS'it drew on the immense talents of its people and also islams engagement with diverse civilizations ancient egypt , mesopotamia and africa ; the persian , central asian and caucasian lands ; the region of east asia ; and , with buddhism and indian philosophy and science .'
p15804
aS'as it enriched itself , it also enriched the world .'
p15805
aS'it set , once again , an enduring lesson of human history : it is through openness and enquiry , engagement and accommodation , and respect for diversity that humanity advances , nations progress and the world prospers .'
p15806
aS'and , this is the message of sufism , one of the greatest contributions of islam to this world .'
p15807
aS'from its origins in egypt and west asia , sufism travelled to distant lands , holding aloft the banner of faith and the flag of human values , learning from spiritual thoughts of other civilisations , and attracting people with the life and message of its saints .'
p15808
aS'in the different settings of saharan africa or in southeast asia , in turkey or in central asia , in iran or india , sufism reflected the universal human desire to go beyond the practice and precepts of religion for a deeper unity with the almighty .'
p15809
aS'and , in that spiritual and mystical enquiry , sufis experienced the universal message of almighty : that perfection in human life is reflected in the qualities that are dear to god .'
p15810
aS'that all are creations of god ; and , that if we love god , we must also love all his creations .'
p15811
aS'as hazrat nizamuddin auliya said , almighty holds dear those who love him for the sake of human beings , and those who love human beings for the sake of almighty .'
p15812
aS'this is the message of oneness of humanity , of all of almightys creations .'
p15813
aS'for the sufis , therefore , service to god meant service to humanity .'
p15814
aS'in the words of khwaja moinuddin chishti , of all the worships , the worship that pleases the almighty god the most is the grant of relief to the humble and the oppressed .'
p15815
aS'in a beautiful imagery of human values , he said , human beings must have the affection of the sun , the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth , because they benefit us all , without discrimination and distinction among people .'
p15816
aS'and , its humanism also upheld the place and status of women in society .'
p15817
aS'above all , sufism is a celebration of diversity and pluralism , expressed in the words of hazrat nizamuddin auliya , that every people has its own path of truth , beliefs and focus of reverence .'
p15818
aS'these words reflect the divine message to the holy prophet that there is no compulsion in religion ; and also that to every people we have appointed ways of worship which they observe .'
p15819
aS'and , it is in harmony with the soul of the bhakti saints saying in the hindu tradition , into the bosom of the one great sea , flow streams that come from hills on every side .'
p15820
aS'and in the wisdom of bulleh shah , lord is mixed in every heart .'
p15821
aS'these values are the need of our times .'
p15822
aS'this is the reality of nature .'
p15823
aS'we learn this wisdom in the perfect balance and harmony that exists in the vast diversity of a forest .'
p15824
aS'its message is beyond the confines of schools and sects .'
p15825
aS'its a spiritual quest that traces its origin from the holy prophet and the fundamental values of islam , which literally means peace .'
p15826
aS'and , it reminds us that when we think of the 99 names of allah , none stand for force and violence , and that the first two names denote compassionate and merciful .'
p15827
aS'allah is rahman and raheem .'
p15828
aS'sufism is the voice of peace , co-existence , compassion and equality ; a call to universal brotherhood .'
p15829
aS'and , just as india became a principal center of islamic civilization , our nation also emerged as one of the most vibrant hubs of sufism .'
p15830
aS'sufism became the face of islam in india , even as it remained deeply rooted in the holy quran , and hadis .'
p15831
aS'sufism blossomed in indias openness and pluralism .'
p15832
aS'it engaged with her spiritual tradition , and evolved its own indian ethos .'
p15833
aS'and , it helped shape a distinct islamic heritage of india .'
p15834
aS'we see this heritage in the fields of art , architecture and culture that is part of the fabric of our nation and our collective daily lives .'
p15835
aS'we see it in the spiritual and intellectual tradition of india .'
p15836
aS'it helped strengthen the inclusive culture that is our great nations immense contribution to the cultural tapestry of this world .'
p15837
aS'in baba farids poetry or guru granth sahib , we feel the same spiritual connection .'
p15838
aS'we see compassion in the langars of sufi shrines and the village tombs of local pirs that attracted the poor and hungry ; the words of hindavi were spoken in the sufi khanqahs .'
p15839
aS'sufisms contribution to poetry in india is huge .'
p15840
aS'its impact on the development of indian music is profound .'
p15841
aS'none had a greater impact than the sufi poet-musician amir khusrau .'
p15842
aS'eight centuries later , his poetry and musical innovation continue to be part of the soul of hindustani music .'
p15843
aS'no one had spoken of indian music with such passion as he had .'
p15844
aS'who else could have expressed love for india so beautifully as he did : but india , from head to toe , is a picture of heaven , adam came from the palace of paradise , he could only be sent to an orchard of fruits that is india .'
p15845
aS'if india is not paradise , how could it be made the abode of the peacock , the bird of paradise ?'
p15846
aS'it is this spirit of sufism , the love for their country and the pride in their nation that define the muslims in india .'
p15847
aS'they reflect the timeless culture of peace , diversity and equality of faith of our land ; they are steeped in the democratic tradition of india , confident of their place in the country and invested in the future of their nation ; and , above all , they are shaped by the values of the islamic heritage of india .'
p15848
aS'it upholds the highest ideals of islam and has always rejected the forces of terrorism and extremism .'
p15849
aS'now , as they travel to different parts of the world , they are the ambassadors of the values and traditions of our nation .'
p15850
aS'as a nation , we stood against colonialism and in our struggle for freedom .'
p15851
aS'at the dawn of independence some chose to go away ; and , i believe , that it also had to do with the colonial politics of that time .'
p15852
aS'the tallest of our leaders , such as maulana azad , and important spiritual leaders , such as maulana hussain madani , and millions and millions of ordinary citizens , rejected the idea of division on the basis of religion .'
p15853
aS'now , india is moving forward on the strength of the struggles , the sacrifices , the bravery , the knowledge , the skill , the art and the pride of every member of every faith in our diverse and yet united nation .'
p15854
aS'like the strings of sitar that each produces a note , but come together to create a beautiful melody .'
p15855
aS'this is the spirit of india .'
p15856
aS'this is the strength of our nation .'
p15857
aS'all our people , hindus , muslims , sikhs , christians , jains , buddhists , the micro-minority of parsis , believers , non-believers , are an integral part of india .'
p15858
aS'just as it once came to india , today sufism from india has spread across the world .'
p15859
aS'but , this tradition that evolved in india belongs to the whole of south asia .'
p15860
aS'that is why i urge others in the region to nurture and revive this glorious heritage of ours .'
p15861
aS'when the spiritual love of sufism , not the violent force of terrorism , flows across the border , this region will be the paradise on earth that amir khusrau spoke about .'
p15862
aS'let me paraphrase what i have said before : terrorism divides and destroys us .'
p15863
aS'indeed , when terrorism and extremism have become the most destructive force of our times , the message of sufism has global relevance .'
p15864
aS'in the centres of conflict in west asia to calm cities in distant countries , in the remote villages of africa to the towns in our own region , terrorism is a daily threat .'
p15865
aS'each day brings us terrible news and horrifying images : - of schools turned into graveyards of innocence ; - of prayer gatherings turned into funeral processions , - of call to prayer or azaan drowned by the sound of explosion ; - of blood on the beach , massacres in malls and smouldering cars on streets ; - of thriving cities ruined and priceless heritage destroyed ; - and , of parents bearing coffins , entire communities dislocated , millions displaced , and refugees caught between fire and stormy seas .'
p15866
aS'in this digital century of new promise and opportunities , the reach of terror is growing and its toll is rising every year .'
p15867
aS'since the beginning of this century , tens of thousands of families have lost their loved ones in thousands of terrorist incidents globally .'
p15868
aS'last year alone , i am talking about 2015 , over 90 countries experienced terrorist attacks .'
p15869
aS'parents in 100 countries live with the daily pain of their children lost to the battlefields of syria .'
p15870
aS'and , in a globally mobile world , one incident can claim citizens of many nations .'
p15871
aS'every year , we spend over 100 billion dollars on securing the world from terrorism , money that should have been spent on building lives of the poor .'
p15872
aS'the impact can not be fully captured in statistics alone .'
p15873
aS'it is changing the way we live .'
p15874
aS'there are forces and groups that are instruments of state policy and design .'
p15875
aS'there are others recruited to the cause in misguided belief .'
p15876
aS'there are some who are trained in organized camps .'
p15877
aS'there are those who find their inspiration in the borderless world of cyber space .'
p15878
aS'terrorism uses diverse motivations and causes , none of which can be justified .'
p15879
aS'terrorists distort a religion whose cause they profess to support .'
p15880
aS'they kill and destroy more in their own land and among their own people than they do elsewhere .'
p15881
aS'and , they are putting entire regions to peril and making the world more insecure and violent .'
p15882
aS'the fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion .'
p15883
aS'it can not be .'
p15884
aS'it is a struggle between the values of humanism and the forces of inhumanity .'
p15885
aS'it is not a conflict to be fought only through military , intelligence or diplomatic means .'
p15886
aS'it is also a battle that must be won through the strength of our values and the real message of religions .'
p15887
aS'as i have said before , we must reject any link between terrorism and religion .'
p15888
aS'those who spread terror in the name of religion are anti-religious .'
p15889
aS'and , we must advance the message of sufism that stands for the principles of islam and the highest human values .'
p15890
aS'this is a task that states , societies , sages , scholars and families must pursue .'
p15891
aS'however , to me , the message of sufism is not just confined to combating terrorism .'
p15892
aS'the values of harmony , welfare , compassion and love for human beings are the foundation of a just society .'
p15893
aS'that is the principle behind my creed of sab ka saath , sab ka vikaas .'
p15894
aS'and , these values are important to preserve and nurture diversity in our societies .'
p15895
aS'diversity is a basic reality of nature and source of richness of a society ; and , it should not be a cause of discord .'
p15896
aS'we need just not constitutional provisions or legal safeguards , but also social values to build an inclusive and peaceful society , in which everyone belongs , secure about his rights and confident of her future .'
p15897
aS'this is also a time of great flux and transition in the world .'
p15898
aS'the middle of the last century was an important turning point in history .'
p15899
aS'a new world order emerged .'
p15900
aS'many new nations were born .'
p15901
aS'at the beginning of a new century , we are at yet another point of transformation on a scale rarely seen in human history .'
p15902
aS'in many parts of the world , there is uncertainty about the future , and how to deal with it as nations and societies .'
p15903
aS'these are precisely the times that the world is most vulnerable to violence and conflicts .'
p15904
aS'the global community must be more vigilant than ever before and counter the forces of darkness with the radiant light of human values .'
p15905
aS'so , let us remember the teaching of holy quran that if anyone slew one innocent person , it would be as if he slew a whole people ; if anyone saved one life , it would be as if he saved a whole people .'
p15906
aS'let us be inspired by the message of hazrat moinuddin chishti , with your spiritual light , dissolve the clouds of discord and war and spread goodwill , peace , and harmony among the people .'
p15907
aS'let us remember the infinite humanism in sufi poet jalaluddin rumis words , contain all human faces in your own , without any judgment of them .'
p15908
aS'let us also live the sermon of bible that calls us to do good , seek peace and pursue it .'
p15909
aS'and , oneness in kabirs observation that a river and its waves are one .'
p15910
aS'and , guru nanak devjis prayer that lord , may everyone in the world prosper and be in peace .'
p15911
aS'let us be inspired by swami vivekanandas appeal against divisions and for people of all religions to hold the banner of harmony , not of dispute .'
p15912
aS'let us also reaffirm the enduring message of ahimsa of lord buddha and mahavira .'
p15913
aS'and , from this forum , in this land of gandhi , and , of timeless prayers that always end with invocation of om shanti ; shanti ; shanti : peace , peace , peace , ; peace within and in the world .'
p15914
aS'let us , therefore , send a message to the world : - a melody of harmony and humanity- the embrace of diversity , the spirit of oneness - of service with compassion and generosity , - a resolve against terrorism , a rejection of extremism- and , a determination to advance peacelet us challenge the forces of violence with the kindness of our love and universal human values .'
p15915
aS'and lastly , let us restore the light of hope and turn this world into a garden of peace .'
p15916
aS'thank you for being here .'
p15917
aS'thank you for what you stand for .'
p15918
aS'thank you for the role you are playing in building a better world .'
p15919
aS'thank you very much , thanks a lot .'
p15920
aa(lp15921
S'my dear fellow citizens , let me begin by wishing namaskar to all of you .'
p15922
aS'today , the world over , christians are observing easter .'
p15923
aS'i extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of easter .'
p15924
aS'some of my young friends must be busy with their examinations .'
p15925
aS'some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now .'
p15926
aS'for those of you who still have examinations , it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and t-20 cricket world cup on the other .'
p15927
aS'i am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between india and australia this evening .'
p15928
aS'some days ago india won two fine matches against pakistan and bangladesh .'
p15929
aS'we are seeing a fine momentum building up in this t-20 cricket world cup .'
p15930
aS'today , as india and australia get ready to play , i convey my best wishes to both the teams .'
p15931
aS'with the young comprising 65 % of our population , there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports .'
p15932
aS'this wont do .'
p15933
aS'we need to usher revolutionary changes in sports .'
p15934
aS'we can see that happening in india .'
p15935
aS'as with cricket , theres now increasing interest in football , hockey , tennis , and kabaddi .'
p15936
aS'you must have come to know that india will be hosting the fifa under-17 world cup next year .'
p15937
aS'twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country .'
p15938
aS'the indian football team won the gold medal at the asian games in 1951 and 1962 , and came fourth in the 1956 olympics .'
p15939
aS'unfortunately , over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs .'
p15940
aS'today our ranking in fifa is so low that i feel reluctant even to mention it .'
p15941
aS'on the other hand , i have been noticing that interest in football among the youth in india has been rising be it the english premier league , spanish league or the indian super league matches .'
p15942
aS'young indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television .'
p15943
aS'what i mean to say is , given this rising popular interest in football and the opportunity of hosting fifa under-17 world cup , shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility ?'
p15944
aS'or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports ?'
p15945
aS'we should create an atmosphere of football , football , football all around for this whole year in schools , colleges , indeed , all over india .'
p15946
aS'our youth , the children in our schools , should be drenched in sweat just playing football .'
p15947
aS'if that happens , we shall have real fun playing the host .'
p15948
aS'so , all of us should make the effort to ensure football reaches every village , street and alley .'
p15949
aS'between now and the fifa under-17 world cup in 2017 , we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth .'
p15950
aS'one advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities .'
p15951
aS'but i personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game .'
p15952
aS'friends , i would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 fifa under-17 world cup to our advantage .'
p15953
aS'how should this event be ?'
p15954
aS'what kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum ?'
p15955
aS'how should it be publicised ?'
p15956
aS'what improvements do we need to make ?'
p15957
aS'how can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 fifa under-17 world cup ?'
p15958
aS'how can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments , educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game ?'
p15959
aS'we can see all this happening in relation to cricket ; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well .'
p15960
aS'the fifa event offers us a unique opportunity to do so .'
p15961
aS'can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity ?'
p15962
aS'i view the fifa event as a great opportunity to establish india as a brand at a global level .'
p15963
aS'i consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of indias youth power not in the sense of winning or losing a match .'
p15964
aS'in the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 fifa event , we can harness and display our many strengths ; while doing so , we can do image-branding for india as well .'
p15965
aS'i look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 fifa under-17 world cup which you can send me through narendramodiapp .'
p15966
aS'do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans .'
p15967
aS'how should we propagate this throughout india ?'
p15968
aS'what should the songs be like ?'
p15969
aS'what should be in the souvenirs ?'
p15970
aS'think about it friends .'
p15971
aS'i would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 fifa under-17 world cup .'
p15972
aS'you should robustly participate in this event .'
p15973
aS'its a golden chance to build indias image .'
p15974
aS'my dear students , you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays .'
p15975
aS'there are very few people who go abroad ; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so .'
p15976
aS'some people also go outside their states .'
p15977
aS'last time too , i had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit .'
p15978
aS'and i have noticed that the kind of work which our department of tourism , our department of culture , state governments and the government of india cant do , that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of indian tourists .'
p15979
aS'photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them .'
p15980
aS'we have to take this task forward .'
p15981
aS'do it this time as well .'
p15982
aS'but this time , along with a photo , please write and send a small piece about the place , thus displaying your creative prowess .'
p15983
aS'one gets to learn a lot by visiting new places .'
p15984
aS'things we cant learn in a classroom , within our family , from our friends , sometimes we can learn those things by travelling .'
p15985
aS'we get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit we learn about people , their languages , foods and lifestyles .'
p15986
aS'someone has rightly said that a traveller without observation is a bird without wings .'
p15987
aS'if you have a desire to truly view , you should also develop an insight .'
p15988
aS'india is full of diversities .'
p15989
aS'once you set out to see the country , for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it .'
p15990
aS'i have been fortunate that i had a lot of opportunities to travel .'
p15991
aS'when i was neither chief minister nor prime minster , and i was young like you , i travelled a lot .'
p15992
aS'perhaps there isnt a district in india which i have not visited .'
p15993
aS'travel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives .'
p15994
aS'these days the youth of india are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity .'
p15995
aS'unlike before , they dont want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track .'
p15996
aS'they want to do something new , see something new .'
p15997
aS'i see this as a good sign .'
p15998
aS'our youth should be bold .'
p15999
aS'they should be brave .'
p16000
aS'they should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before .'
p16001
aS'in this context , i would like to specially congratulate coal india .'
p16002
aS'western coalfields limited at savaner near nagpur , where there are coal mines , has developed an eco-friendly mine-tourism circuit .'
p16003
aS'generally we dont think of coal mines as places to be visited .'
p16004
aS'when we see pictures of miners , we wonder what it must be like out there .'
p16005
aS'we even have a saying , coal blackens your hands , hence people tend to stay away from coal mines .'
p16006
aS'but western coalfields limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism .'
p16007
aS'this is only the beginning , but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this eco-friendly mine-tourism site at savaner near nagpur .'
p16008
aS'this in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new .'
p16009
aS'i hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too .'
p16010
aS'there is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free .'
p16011
aS'both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it .'
p16012
aS'maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way , but it is being done .'
p16013
aS'can you too , being a tourist , lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations ?'
p16014
aS'i am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task .'
p16015
aS'tourism is a sector that provides maximum employment .'
p16016
aS'even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism .'
p16017
aS'when tourists visit a place , even the not-so-well-off among them spend money .'
p16018
aS'rich tourists are bound to spend more money .'
p16019
aS'there are many employment opportunities created by tourism .'
p16020
aS'india lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world .'
p16021
aS'but if we , 125 crore indians , decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector , we can attract the world .'
p16022
aS'we can draw a very large number of tourists to our side .'
p16023
aS'through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in india .'
p16024
aS'be it the government , institutions , society , citizens we all have to come together to make this happen .'
p16025
aS'come , lets make an endeavour in this direction .'
p16026
aS'my dear young friends , i dont like it when holidays are just frittered away .'
p16027
aS'you too should think along these lines .'
p16028
aS'will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that ?'
p16029
aS'i will give you something to ponder upon .'
p16030
aS'can you resolve to add one skill , one special attribute to your personality , during your holidays ?'
p16031
aS'if you dont know how to swim , can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays ?'
p16032
aS'if you dont know how to cycle , can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays ?'
p16033
aS'or you could tell yourself , i type with just two fingers on the keyboard , so shouldnt i learn proper way of typing ?'
p16034
aS'there are so many skills to develop our personality .'
p16035
aS'why not learn them ?'
p16036
aS'why not overcome some of our shortcomings ?'
p16037
aS'why not add to our strengths ?'
p16038
aS'do give it a thought .'
p16039
aS'it is not like you need lots of classes , a great trainer , hefty fees or a big budget for this .'
p16040
aS'you can find something around you .'
p16041
aS'lets say you decide to make the best out of waste .'
p16042
aS'just look for some waste material and start creating something from it .'
p16043
aS'you will enjoy it .'
p16044
aS'by the time evening falls , you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish .'
p16045
aS'suppose you are fond of painting and you dont know how to paint .'
p16046
aS'just start painting and gradually you will get better at it .'
p16047
aS'you must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent , acquiring some new skill .'
p16048
aS'there can be countless areas where you could do so ; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that i am spelling out for you .'
p16049
aS'this will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously .'
p16050
aS'just try it for yourself .'
p16051
aS'when you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays , and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new , they will realise that they wasted their time .'
p16052
aS'they will admire you , you are a very determined man , my friend , you have accomplished something concrete .'
p16053
aS'this will perhaps become a big thing among friends .'
p16054
aS'i am confident that you will surely do it and , yes , do share with me what you have learned .'
p16055
aS'this time a lot of suggestions have come for mann ki baat on www .'
p16056
aS'mygov .'
p16057
aS'in : -sound byte- my name is abhi chaturvedi .'
p16058
aS'namaste dear prime minister , you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water .'
p16059
aS'i did this and enjoyed it and in this way i made friends with a lot of birds .'
p16060
aS'i request you to repeat this task in mann ki baat .'
p16061
aS'thank you .'
p16062
aS'my dear fellow citizens , i would like to express my gratitude to this little boy abhi .'
p16063
aS'he called me up and reminded me of what i had said .'
p16064
aS'frankly , i had forgotten about it .'
p16065
aS'and i did not have it in my mind that i would say something on this topic , but abhi has reminded me that last year i had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds .'
p16066
aS'friends , i want to thank this boy abhi chaturvedi .'
p16067
aS'he has reminded me of a good deed by calling me .'
p16068
aS'last summer i had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers .'
p16069
aS'abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends .'
p16070
aS'the great hindi poetess mahadevi verma used to love birds .'
p16071
aS'she wrote this in one of her poems , we shall not let you fly far way , we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water .'
p16072

aS'come , let us also do what mahadevi ji used to do .'
p16073
aS'i greet abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing .'
p16074
aS'shilpa kukke from mysore has raised a very humane issue .'
p16075
aS'she says milkmen , newspaper vendors , postmen come close to our homes .'
p16076
aS'sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes .'
p16077
aS'have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days ?'
p16078
aS'have we ever given them water to drink ?'
p16079
aS'shilpa , i am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner .'
p16080
aS'it is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water , he will feel good .'
p16081
aS'of course , it is a part of our nature in india .'
p16082
aS'but i am glad , shilpa , that you have observed these things .'
p16083
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters , you must have repeatedly heard the term - digital india .'
p16084
aS'some people feel that digital india is to do with the world of the youth in our cities .'
p16085
aS'no , its not like that .'
p16086
aS'you will be happy to learn that a kisan suvidha app has been launched to serve your interests .'
p16087
aS'if you download this kisan suvidha app on your mobile phone , you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips .'
p16088
aS'there are many topics on this app , such as what is the state of the market , what is the position of the wholesale market , which crops are doing well these days , which are the appropriate pesticides .'
p16089
aS'not just this .'
p16090
aS'there is a button on the app which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts .'
p16091
aS'if you pose a question to them , they will reply to it ; they will explain things to you .'
p16092
aS'i hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the kisan suvidha app on their mobile phones .'
p16093
aS'why dont you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you ?'
p16094
aS'if you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also .'
p16095
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters , summer is holiday time for the rest of the people , but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more .'
p16096
aS'a farmer waits for the rains .'
p16097
aS'before that , he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste .'
p16098
aS'for farmers , the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance .'
p16099
aS'we will have to give a thought to what will happen if theres no water .'
p16100
aS'can we utilise this time to visit ponds , check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing , because of which reservoirs get depleted .'
p16101
aS'can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected ?'
p16102
aS'if we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds , rivers and streams , then even if the rains fail later , our losses will be reduced .'
p16103
aS'but this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water .'
p16104
aS'you must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs .'
p16105
aS'under mnrega also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation .'
p16106
aS'every village should save water .'
p16107
aS'how can we save every drop of water during the coming rains ?'
p16108
aS'how do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village ?'
p16109
aS'you should devise a plan and get connected with government schemes so that we can start a peoples movement which will help us understand the importance of water .'
p16110
aS'then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation .'
p16111
aS'there must be many such villages in the country , many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work .'
p16112
aS'but we still need to do much more in this direction .'
p16113
aS'my dear farmer brothers and sisters , a few days ago the government of india had organised a very big kisan mela , farmers fair .'
p16114
aS'there i saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture .'
p16115
aS'but we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields .'
p16116
aS'now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed .'
p16117
aS'i welcome this .'
p16118
aS'excessive use of fertilisers has made our mother earth unwell .'
p16119
aS'we are the children of our soil , so how can we watch our mother earth suffering ?'
p16120
aS'when we add spices and condiments while cooking our food , it adds to the taste .'
p16121
aS'but if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments , then would one want to eat that food ?'
p16122
aS'the same food would taste so bad , isnt it ?'
p16123
aS'the same thing happens with fertilisers as well .'
p16124
aS'no matter how good fertilisers may be , if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination .'
p16125
aS'there should be a balance in everything .'
p16126
aS'this will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money .'
p16127
aS'our stand is clear : less cost , more output .'
p16128
aS'invest less and reap more .'
p16129
aS'we should move forward with this mantra and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods .'
p16130
aS'i hope we will do , with full concentration , whatever is necessary for water conservation .'
p16131
aS'we have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon .'
p16132
aS'do remember , the more we save water , the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved .'
p16133
aS'my dear fellow citizens , the world health day is on 7th april .'
p16134
aS'this year the theme of the world health day is beat diabetes .'
p16135
aS'i call upon all of you to defeat diabetes which plays host to so many diseases .'
p16136
aS'once it enters yours body , a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it .'
p16137
aS'it is said that in 2014 india had about six and a half crore diabetics .'
p16138
aS'diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths .'
p16139
aS'diabetes is of two types -- type 1 and type 2 .'
p16140
aS'type 1 is hereditary ; if the parents have it , so shall their child .'
p16141
aS'type 2 is due to your habits , age and obesity .'
p16142
aS'the world is worried about diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for world health day on 7th april .'
p16143
aS'we all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for diabetes .'
p16144
aS'physical labour is getting reduced .'
p16145
aS'there is not a trace of sweat ; there is just no walking around .'
p16146
aS'even if we play games , we play them online ; very little happens offline .'
p16147
aS'can we not , drawing inspiration from this years world health day and its theme , do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life ?'
p16148
aS'if you are interested in yoga , then do yoga .'
p16149
aS'or else , the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run .'
p16150
aS'if every citizen of my country is healthy , then my country will be healthy .'
p16151
aS'sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done .'
p16152
aS'when the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is diabetes to blame .'
p16153
aS'what do you lose in getting a check-up done ?'
p16154
aS'please get this much done at least .'
p16155
aS'everything is available and a check-up can be done easily .'
p16156
aS'please do be concerned about this .'
p16157
aS'on march 24th , the world observed tuberculosis day .'
p16158
aS'when i was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word tb .'
p16159
aS'it would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease .'
p16160
aS'but now we are not scared of it because everybody knows tb is curable and can be easily cured .'
p16161
aS'paradoxically , when tb was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it ; but now that it is curable , we have become almost careless about it .'
p16162
aS'compared to the world , we still have a large number of tb patients .'
p16163
aS'if we want to free ourselves and our country from tb , then we need correct treatment , we need complete treatment .'
p16164
aS'if we leave the treatment mid-way , it can create new complications for us .'
p16165
aS'tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot .'
p16166
aS'oh look !'
p16167
aS'you have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight .'
p16168
aS'go get it checked .'
p16169
aS'you must have got tb .'
p16170
aS'this shows tb is one illness that can be detected fast .'
p16171
aS'my dear fellow citizens , there is a lot of work being done in this direction .'
p16172
aS'there are more than 13,500 microscopy centres , more than four lakh dots providers , various advanced laboratories .'
p16173
aS'and all these services are free .'
p16174
aS'please go and get a check-up done .'
p16175
aS'this disease can be got rid of .'
p16176
aS'all one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely .'
p16177
aS'i would like to appeal to you all , whether it is tb or diabetes , we have to conquer these .'
p16178
aS'we have to eradicate these diseases from india .'
p16179
aS'but this can not happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you dont do something about it .'
p16180
aS'so i call upon all of you today to defeat diabetes and free ourselves from tuberculosis .'
p16181
aS'my dear fellow citizens , a number of important occasions are coming up in april , especially on 14th of april which happens to be the birth anniversary of baba saheb bhimrao ambedkar .'
p16182
aS'his 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country .'
p16183
aS'the five pilgrimage spots associated with him mhow , his birthplace ; london , where he was educated , nagpur , where he had his deeksha ; 26 , alipur road , delhi , where his soul left him for its heavenly abode ; and the cremation ground in mumbai where his last rites were performed .'
p16184
aS'we are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots .'
p16185
aS'i am fortunate to get the chance to visit mhow , the birthplace of our revered baba saheb ambedkar , on 14th april this year .'
p16186
aS'baba saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens .'
p16187
aS'we can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens .'
p16188
aS'in a few days from now , the new year of vikram samvat will begin .'
p16189
aS'it is celebrated in different states in different forms .'
p16190
aS'some call it nav samvatsar , some call it gudi padva , some varsh pratipada , some ugadi , but it holds importance in nearly all the states of india .'
p16191
aS'my greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of new year .'
p16192
aS'as you know and i had said it last time also , you can now listen to my mann ki baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to .'
p16193
aS'you can choose your own convenient time to listen to it .'
p16194
aS'you can listen to it on your own mobile handset .'
p16195
aS'all you have to do is to give a missed call .'
p16196
aS'i am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched , 35 lakh people have availed of it .'
p16197
aS'you too can note down the number .'
p16198
aS'81908-81908 .'
p16199
aS'i repeat 81908-81908 .'
p16200
aS'give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you .'
p16201
aS'even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of mann ki baat , you can listen to it in the language of your choice .'
p16202
aS'i will be happy to remain connected with you .'
p16203
aS'my dear fellow citizens , my heartiest best wishes to you all .'
p16204
aS'many , many thanks .'
p16205
aa(lp16206
S'your excellency prime minister charles michel , ladies and gentlemen .'
p16207
aS'thank you for your remarks .'
p16208
aS'last week has been a sad week for belgium .'
p16209
aS'let me say mr prime minister that we share the depth of sorrow and grief that the people of belgium have experienced in the last 8 days .'
p16210
aS'my deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones to the terror strikes in brussels last week .'
p16211
aS'having experienced terrorist violence ourselves on countless occasions , we share your pain .'
p16212
aS'mr prime minister , in this time of crisis , the whole of india stands in full support and solidarity with the belgian people .'
p16213
aS'i deeply appreciate your welcome and the time that you have devoted to me despite pressing demands on you .'
p16214
aS'as part of our efforts to respond to this common challenge we could resume discussions on a mutual legal assistance treaty .'
p16215
aS'negotiations on extradition treaty and a treaty on exchange of sentenced prisoners could be concluded expeditiously .'
p16216
aS'friends , our two countries share a long history of friendship .'
p16217
aS'a hundred years ago , more than 130,000 soldiers from india fought in the first world war alongside your countrymen on belgian soil .'
p16218
aS'more than 9,000 indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice .'
p16219
aS'next year will mark the 70th anniversary of india-belgium diplomatic ties .'
p16220
aS'to celebrate this important milestone in our friendship , we look forward to welcoming his majesty king philippe of belgium in india next year .'
p16221
aS'we would also be commemorating it with a joint programme of activities in each others countries .'
p16222
aS'my conversation with prime minister charles michel today covered the whole spectrum of our ties .'
p16223
aS'a system of bilateral foreign policy consultations would recommend concrete ways to upgrade our partnership .'
p16224
aS'friends , india is one of the brightest economic opportunities in the world today .'
p16225
aS'our macroeconomic fundamentals are robust , and at 7 % plus , we are one of the fastest growing economies of the world .'
p16226
aS'i believe that a combination of belgian capacities and indias economic growth can produce promising opportunities for businesses on both sides .'
p16227
aS'prime minister and i have just held a productive interaction with belgian ceos and business persons earlier today .'
p16228
aS'i invite the belgian government and companies to pro-actively associate with indias ambitious development projects including digital india , start up india and skill india .'
p16229
aS'belgian businesses can make their global supply chains more cost effective by manufacturing in india .'
p16230
aS'indias goal to modernize infrastructure , especially railways and ports , and building of 100 plus smart cities also presents a unique investment opportunity for the belgian companies .'
p16231
aS'these partnerships can help us reach new heights in our trade and commercial partnership .'
p16232
aS'i have invited prime minister michel to visit india with belgian businesses to see first-hand the reality of indias economic and political promise .'
p16233
aS'clearly , it is not just diamonds that can bring shine to our partnership .'
p16234
aS'climate change is one of the greatest challenges before mankind .'
p16235
aS'prime minister and i have agreed to enhance our cooperation in renewable energy .'
p16236
aS'we would also build partnerships in areas such as harnessing waste for energy , small wind turbines and zero emission buildings .'
p16237
aS'advancement in s & t and high technology areas is of particular importance for indias development priorities .'
p16238
aS'we welcome belgiums collaboration in these areas .'
p16239
aS'prime minister michel and i have just activated , remotely , indias largest optical telescope .'
p16240
aS'this product of indo-belgian collaboration is an inspiring example of what our partnership can achieve .'
p16241
aS'the work is also afoot on other agreements in the areas of information and communication technology , audio-visual production tourism biotechnology and shipping and ports .'
p16242
aS'friends , in a couple of hours from now , i would meet the e .'

p16250
aS'trade , investment , and technology partnership between india and the e .'
p16251
aS'u .'
p16252
aS'would be one of the focus areas of our discussions .'
p16253
aS'i feel that a progressive path and creative mind-set to india-e .'
p16254
aS'u trade and investment agreement can enable all the european countries , including belgium , to benefit from indias strong economic growth .'
p16255
aS'i once again express my sincere gratitude to prime minister charles michel for his time , welcome and hospitality .'
p16256
aS'i look forward to welcoming him in india .'
p16257
aS'thank you .'
p16258
aa(lp16259
S'minister for agriculture & forests , royal government of bhutan and chairman , global tiger forum , distinguished ministers from tiger range countries , shri prakash javadekar , our minister for environment , forest & climate change , other dignitaries on the dais , delegates from tiger range countries , ladies and gentlemen !'
p16260
aS'i am pleased to welcome you all .'
p16261
aS'the tiger has brought all of us together here .'
p16262
aS'this is an important meeting to discuss the conservation of one of the important endangered species .'
p16263
aS'your very presence is a testimony to the importance your country attaches to this umbrella among species .'
p16264
aS'as we all know , the tiger is an apex consumer in the ecological pyramid and food chain .'
p16265
aS'it requires a large amount of prey , supported by good forests .'
p16266
aS'therefore , by protecting the tiger , we protect the entire ecosystem and the ecological services , which are equally crucial for the well-being of human beings .'
p16267
aS'in fact , the benefits from tiger conservation are enormous but intangible .'
p16268
aS'we can not quantify this in economic terms .'
p16269
aS'putting a price tag on nature is difficult .'
p16270
aS'since mother nature has bestowed them for its own conservation , it becomes our bounden duty to conserve them .'
p16271
aS'in india , the tiger is much more than just a wild animal .'
p16272
aS'in our mythology , the mother goddess , who is the embodiment of mother nature , is depicted sitting on a tiger .'
p16273
aS'in fact , most of our gods and goddesses are associated with some animal , tree or river .'
p16274
aS'in fact sometimes these animals are put on the same pedestal as gods and goddesses .'
p16275
aS'no wonder the tiger is also our national animal .'
p16276
aS'i am sure , other tiger range countries would have some cultural legacy associated with tigers .'
p16277
aS'friends !'
p16278
aS'species belonging to the animal kingdom , usually do not act to their disadvantage .'
p16279
aS'however , human beings are an exception .'
p16280
aS'our compulsions and cravings , our needs and greed , have led to shrinkage of natural habitat and destruction of ecosystems .'
p16281
aS'here , i recall the famous words of gautam buddha who said : the forest is a peculiar organism of unlimited kindness .'
p16282
aS'it affords protection to all beings , offering shade even to the axe-man who destroys it .'
p16283
aS'i appreciate the good efforts made by the tiger range countries in conserving tigers .'
p16284
aS'i compliment you all for this great ongoing effort .'
p16285
aS'i also appreciate the efforts through global tiger initiative and the council .'
p16286
aS'i must mention the great effort made by mr vladimir putin in convening the tiger summit in 2010 .'
p16287
aS'the global tiger recovery programme was an important outcome of these efforts .'
p16288
aS'i also appreciate the initiatives of mr dorji , the chairman of the global tiger forum .'
p16289
aS'however , from what i have been told it appears that tiger habitats have reduced drastically across tiger range countries .'
p16290
aS'the situation has been aggravated further by the ongoing trafficking in body parts and derivatives of this magnificent animal .'
p16291
aS'in india too , we have been facing the challenge of poaching and disruption in their ecosystems .'
p16292
aS'the positive side for us in india is that majority of the population respects trees , animals , forests , rivers and other elements of nature like the sun and the moon .'
p16293
aS'we consider the earth as our mother .'
p16294
aS'our scriptures encourage us to treat the entire universe as one .'
p16295
aS'and is our philosophy .'
p16296
aS'we pray for peace and prosperity of everyone - including the ecosystem : , , , : , , friends !'
p16297
aS'forests are inseparable from wild animals .'
p16298
aS'both are mutually complementary .'
p16299
aS'destruction of one leads to destruction of the other .'
p16300
aS'this is an important cause of climate change which is now affecting us adversely in many ways .'
p16301
aS'this is a global phenomenon which all of us are grappling with .'
p16302
aS'as a solution , we have committed to work towards country specific mitigation strategies .'
p16303
aS'in my view , for the tiger range countries , a viable tiger population undoubtedly symbolises a mitigation strategy for climate change .'
p16304
aS'this will create a huge carbon sink in the form of tiger bearing forests .'
p16305
aS'thus , conservation of tiger will go a long way in ensuring a good future for ourselves and our coming generations .'
p16306
aS'india has a long standing and successful track record of protecting its tigers .'
p16307
aS'we launched project tiger in 1973 .'
p16308
aS'its coverage has increased considerably from the initial 9 tiger reserves to 49 at present .'
p16309
aS'tiger conservation is a collective responsibility of the government of india and states .'
p16310
aS'i also compliment our state governments for their efforts .'
p16311
aS'but the efforts of government can not succeed unless they are supported by the people .'
p16312
aS'our cultural legacy which encourages compassion and co-existence has played an important role in the success of project tiger .'
p16313
aS'due to such collective efforts , there has been a rise of thirty per cent in the number of tigers .'
p16314
aS'it has gone up from 1706 in 2010 to 2226 in 2014.'
p16315
aS'our national tiger conservation authority has taken many landmark initiatives .'
p16316
aS'use of modern technology , including intelligent , infrared and thermal cameras on a 24x7 basis is being promoted for surveillance against poaching in sensitive tiger reserves .'
p16317
aS'several protocols for smart patrolling and tiger monitoring have been evolved .'
p16318
aS'radio telemetry is also being promoted to monitor tigers .'
p16319
aS'a national repository of tiger camera trap photo database is also being created .'
p16320
aS'to do all this , we have , this year , doubled our allocation for tiger conservation .'
p16321
aS'we have increased it from rupees 185 crores to rupees 380 crores ; which is 3.'
p16322
aS'8 billion rupees .'
p16323
aS'i strongly believe that tiger conservation , or conservation of nature , is not a drag on development .'
p16324
aS'both can happen in a mutually complementary manner .'
p16325
aS'all we need is to re-orient our strategy by factoring in the concerns of the tiger in sectors where tiger conservation is not the goal .'
p16326
aS'this is a difficult task but can be achieved .'
p16327
aS'our genius lies in smartly integrating the tiger and wildlife safeguards in various infrastructures at the landscape level .'
p16328
aS'this essentially takes us to the much needed smart green infrastructure , while adopting a landscape approach .'
p16329
aS'the landscape approach would also help us to involve business groups through corporate social responsibility for various initiatives towards tiger conservation .'
p16330
aS'in the indian context , we intend to achieve this through the tiger conservation plans .'
p16331
aS'considering the ecosystem value of tiger conservation areas , we need to consider them as natural capital .'
p16332
aS'our institutions have done an economic valuation of a few tiger reserves .'
p16333
aS'this study has highlighted the fact that besides conserving the tiger , these reserves also provide a range of economic , social , cultural and spiritual benefits .'
p16334
aS'these are known as ecosystem services .'
p16335
aS'thus , we need to define conservation as a means to achieve development , rather than considering it to be anti-growth .'
p16336
aS'this calls for factoring in the value of the ecosystem in the economic arithmetic of development and growth .'
p16337
aS'friends !'
p16338
aS'i am confident that we can achieve a framework to foster proactive engagement of industry for conservation .'
p16339
aS'the natural capital denoting the stock of natural ecosystems should be treated at par with capital goods .'
p16340
aS'our economy needs to be viewed as a subset of a larger economy of natural resources and ecosystem services which sustain us .'
p16341
aS'as a country having more than seventy per cent of the global tiger population , india is committed to complement the initiatives of other tiger range countries .'
p16342
aS'we have bilateral arrangements with china , nepal , bhutan , bangladesh .'
p16343
aS'we hope to continue our efforts to address issues of mutual concern for the tiger .'
p16344
aS'a major threat to the tiger is the demand for its body parts and derivatives .'
p16345
aS'the forest and its wild denizens are an open treasury which can not be locked up .'
p16346
aS'it is painful to learn about trafficking of body parts and derivatives of tigers and other big cats .'
p16347
aS'we need to collaborate at the highest levels of government to address this serious issue .'
p16348
aS'india along with several tiger range countries is a founder member of the global tiger forum , which is headquartered in new delhi .'
p16349
aS'this is the only inter-governmental organisation of its kind .'
p16350
aS'it is now working closely with the global tiger initiative council .'
p16351
aS'as a host country , i assure you of our fullest support .'
p16352
aS'we will also be happy to support capacity building of wildlife personnel at the wildlife institute of india .'
p16353
aS'the tiger range countries are signatories to other international conventions to address international trade on endangered species .'
p16354
aS'in this regard , i want to give you another good news .'
p16355
aS'we are moving towards formally adopting the statute of south asia wildlife enforcement network .'
p16356
aS'at the end , i would like to emphasise that conservation of tigers is not a choice .'
p16357
aS'it is an imperative .'
p16358
aS'i would also like to emphasise that regional co-operation is essential for combating wildlife crime .'
p16359
aS'in this conference , let us resolve to work together to protect the tiger and its space .'
p16360
aS'india is committed to engage with all tiger range countries for this purpose .'
p16361

aS'i have great pleasure in being with you and welcoming you at the maritime india summit .'
p16368
aS'this is the first time that a global event of such a large scale is being organised by india .'
p16369
aS'i extend a warm welcome to all the esteemed guests attending this event in the maritime hub of india .'
p16370
aS'i am sure , this event ; together with the seminars and exhibition , will showcase the emerging trends and opportunities in the maritime sector .'
p16371
aS'we all know that oceans cover more than seventy percent of the earths surface .'
p16372
aS'we also know that oceans contain ninety-seven percent of the earths water .'
p16373
aS'therefore , maritime transport can be the most extensive mode of transport .'
p16374
aS'it is also the most eco-friendly mode of transport .'
p16375
aS'however , there is one more aspect to this fact .'
p16376
aS'which is that , oceans contain ninety nine percent of the living space on the planet .'
p16377
aS'this means that our lifestyle , transport systems and trading behavior should not spoil the ecology of the oceans .'
p16378
aS'also , maritime security , freedom of navigation and safety and security of sea lanes is equally important .'
p16379
aS'the challenges of climate change have shown that even offshore human behavior can change the ecology of glaciers and oceans .'
p16380
aS'this is already causing a lot of concern for island countries and coastal communities in particular .'
p16381
aS'i hope this summit will deliberate on these issues while discussing economic issues related with oceans .'
p16382
aS'the elimination of sea piracy , which was a big threat to international shipping a few years ago , is a good example of how joint efforts by maritime nations can achieve outstanding results .'
p16383
aS'friends !'
p16384
aS'there is a reason why this important summit has been organised today , on the 14th of april 2016 .'

p16392
aS'babasaheb ambedkar on this auspicious day .'
p16393
aS'i also wish and pray that his wisdom continues to guide us in our efforts towards nation building .'
p16394
aS'many of us may not know that babasaheb created two powerful institutions related to water , navigation and power .'
p16395
aS'they were : the central waterways , irrigation and navigation commission and the central technical power board .'
p16396
aS'his observations while setting up these two organizations is a testimony to his great foresight .'
p16397
aS'i quote from his address on 3rd january , 1945 : the objects which have led to the setting up of two organizations are to advise on how the water resources can be best utilized and how a project can be made to serve purposes other than irrigation .'
p16398
aS'dr ambedkar had emphasized the importance of the new waterways policy in order to lay the foundation for a regime of prosperity for the millions of poor of our country .'
p16399
aS'i am happy to state that we have embarked on the development of national waterways in keeping with babasahebs vision and foresight .'
p16400
aS'with a gdp growth rate of more than seven percent , india is the fastest growing major economy today .'
p16401
aS'the imf and the world bank have indicated even better prospects in the days to come .'
p16402
aS'we are taking aggressive steps to ensure that our process of growth is both fast as well as inclusive .'
p16403
aS'this summit is another step to realize babasahebs dream of an economically strong , socially empowered and technologically equipped india .'
p16404
aS'i understand that more than 4500 dignitaries and delegates from around forty countries are participating in this summit .'

p16408
aS'we indians are inheritors of a glorious maritime heritage .'
p16409
aS'the worlds first dock was built at lothal in gujarat around 2500 bc during the harappan civilisation .'
p16410
aS'this dock was equipped to berth and service ships .'
p16411
aS'it was built after studying tidal flows .'
p16412
aS'in addition to lothal , there were also some other indian ports , which were major drivers of global maritime trade two thousand years ago .'
p16413
aS'these included : barygaza - which today is known as bharuch in gujarat ; muziris which today is known as kodungallur near cochin in kerala ; korkai which is todays tuticorin ; kaveripattinam which is in nagapattanam district of tamil nadu ; andarikamedu which is in ariyankuppam district of puducherry there are many references in ancient indian literature and in greek and roman works about the vibrant maritime trade of india with rome , greece , egypt and arabia .'
p16414
aS'ancient and medieval indian traders maintained links with countries in southeast and east asia , africa , arabia and europe .'
p16415

p16416
aS'since my government took over , among other things , we have laid emphasis on building futuristic infrastructure .'
p16417
aS'this includes building next generation infrastructure in many sectors .'
p16418
aS'port , shipping and maritime infrastructure is prominent among them .'
p16419
aS'it is my governments endeavour to revive and restore indias position of eminence in the global maritime sector .'
p16420
aS'building upon our glorious maritime tradition , we are working hard to achieve new heights in this area .'
p16421
aS'in the very early days of our government , we announced the sagarmala programme .'
p16422
aS'this is aimed at leveraging our long coastline and natural maritime advantages .'
p16423
aS'it also focuses on promoting port led development , energizing the coastal economy and infrastructure development in these areas .'
p16424
aS'we particularly want to modernize our ports and integrate them with special economic zones , port based smart cities , industrial parks , warehouses , logistics parks and transport corridors .'
p16425
aS'i must mention that our vast coastline of 7500 kilometers offers a huge investment opportunity .'
p16426
aS'apart from the length of the coastline , indias maritime potential also lies in its strategic location on all major shipping highways .'
p16427
aS'in addition , we have an expansive and productive hinterland , through which flows a network of mighty rivers .'
p16428
aS'our maritime agenda will complement this ambitious infrastructure plan for the hinterland which is going on in parallel .'
p16429
aS'i call upon the global business community to partner with us to give shape to our process of port led development .'
p16430
aS'i am sure , the long coastline of india along with diverse coastal regions and hard working coastal communities can become an engine of growth of india .'
p16431
aS'to enable the growth of the port and related sectors , we have carried out several reforms and taken a number of new initiatives .'
p16432
aS'under our make in india approach , we have taken many steps to make india a global manufacturing hub ; recently moodys has appreciated the make in india initiative ; we have done a lot of corrections on the front of ease of doing business - we have jumped up 12 ranks in world banks ranking ; a lot of simplification has happened in the processes for cross border trade ; we have greatly liberalized the licensing regimes ; this also includes the defence sector and ship building therein ; we have taken almost sixty per cent of the defence items out of the licensing processmost of the fdi sectors are now put on automatic approval route ; shipyards are being given infrastructure status ; at par with the ports ; rebate of service tax on coastal shipping has been increased to seventy per cent ; we have granted customs duty and central excise exemption on inputs used in ship building ; a scheme of financial assistance to promote ship building has been approved ; customs and central excise duties have been exempted on bunker fuel for indian flagged container ships ; tax issues of sea farers have been resolved ; a new company by the name of indian port rail corporation , has been established to focus on the last mile connectivity to ports .'
p16433
aS'we have enacted a legislation for declaring one hundred and eleven waterways as national waterways-1.'
p16434
aS'we have taken up skill development activities aggressively .'
p16435
aS'the results of our initial efforts are clearly visible : fdi inflows have gone up by 44 per cent since this government took over .'
p16436
aS'in fact , the year 2015-16 has seen the highest ever fdi inflow into india ; indias highest ever quantity of cargo handled by major ports was in 2015 ; the port efficiency parameters have shown very good improvement ; indias fastest average turnaround time in ports was in 2015 ; in the last two years , our major ports have added 165 million tonne capacity with record additions each year ; 94 million tonne capacity was added by these ports in 2015-16 alone which is the highest ever ; the traffic in major ports has shown a healthy growth of more than four per cent in the last two years , despite global slowdown ; the performance of the major ports in the last two years has been remarkable ; operating profit margins which were declining , have increased ; in 2015-16 alone , the operating profit of the twelve major ports has increased by nearly 6.'
p16437
aS'7 billion rupees ; during 2015-16 , kandla port in gujarat breached the one hundred million traffic landmark and displayed twenty per cent improvement in efficiency .'
p16438
aS'jawaharlal nehru port trust registered a net profit of ten billion rupees helped by a twelve per cent increase in efficiency .'
p16439
aS'our flagship companies like the shipping corporation , dredging corporation and the cochin shipyard have registered higher profits as compared to the previous year .'
p16440
aS'however , this is just the beginning .'
p16441
aS'we want to do more .'
p16442
aS'we are enhancing our own capacities of execution and implementation .'
p16443
aS'the national perspective plan of the sagarmala programme has been released today .'
p16444
aS'during the last two years , major ports have awarded 56 new projects involving an investment of more than 250 billion rupees .'
p16445
aS'this will create an additional port capacity of 317 million tonnes per annum .'
p16446
aS'our vision is to increase port capacity from 1400 million tonnes to 3000 million tonnes by 2025 .'
p16447
aS'we want to mobilize an investment of one lakh crore , or one trillion rupees , in the port sector to enable this growth .'
p16448
aS'five new ports are planned to meet the increasing demand of the exim trade which will rise in proportion with the fast-growing indian economy .'
p16449
aS'new ports are also being developed by several coastal states of india .'
p16450
aS'the multiple measures to promote coastal shipping coupled with the anticipated rise in domestic production of coal , is expected to enhance coastal transportation of coal by at least four fold by 2025 .'
p16451
aS'we are engaging with our immediate and regional neighbours to promote shipping and maritime security .'
p16452
aS'recently india has signed a coastal shipping agreement with bangladesh which will be mutually beneficial .'
p16453
aS'india is also engaged in the development of chahbahar port in iran .'
p16454
aS'a special purpose vehicle by the name india ports global limited has been established to take up maritime projects overseas .'
p16455
aS'i am informed that the ministry of shipping is showcasing about 250 projects with investment opportunity in the maritime sector .'
p16456
aS'these projects include various infrastructure development opportunities in 12 major ports , projects in eight maritime states and other agencies .'
p16457
aS'of these , over 100 projects have been identified under the sagarmala programme .'
p16458
aS'with more than 14,000 kilometers of navigable inland waterways in the country , there is tremendous potential for development in this sector .'
p16459
aS'my government is committed to integration in infrastructure .'
p16460
aS'we are also committed to creating an enabling environment for investors and to facilitate investments with an open mind .'
p16461
aS'friends !'
p16462
aS'all this is being done to benefit the common man .'
p16463
aS'this is being done to provide employment to the youth .'
p16464
aS'this is particularly being done to empower coastal communities .'
p16465
aS'approximately eighteen percent of indias population lives in 72 coastal districts .'
p16466
aS'it comprises twelve percent of indias landmass .'
p16467
aS'therefore , there is a need for holistic and sustainable development of coastal regions and communities .'
p16468
aS'development of coastal communities especially fishermen requires an integrated approach .'
p16469
aS'as part of the sagarmala programme , we will adopt a comprehensive approach with focus on capacity building and training , upgrading of technology and for improving physical and social infrastructure .'
p16470
aS'this will be done in collaboration with the coastal states .'
p16471
aS'these initiatives will create employment opportunities of approximately ten million jobs over the next ten years .'
p16472
aS'this includes four million direct and six million indirect jobs .'
p16473
aS'to broaden livelihood opportunities further , we are planning to deploy modern and sophisticated fishing vessels .'
p16474
aS'this would enable them to harness resources in indias exclusive economic zone .'
p16475
aS'in addition , we are also focusing on value addition in fisheries , aquaculture and cold chain development .'
p16476
aS'the port sector in india is a good mix of private and public ports , with both contributing to the growth of the sector .'
p16477
aS'the ppp model of development has been quite successful in this sector and has helped in bringing latest technology and best practices .'
p16478
aS'private ports have been growing at a very healthy pace and have nearly doubled their capacity in the last 5 years .'
p16479
aS'they handle around 45 per cent of the total cargo .'
p16480
aS'most of these ports are new , with modern facilities and can match the best international ports in terms of performance and infrastructure .'
p16481

p16482
aS'india has had a glorious maritime history .'
p16483

p16484
aS'the maritime sector not only creates and facilitates economic activities ; it also connects countries and civilizations .'
p16485
aS'moreover , it is the cleanest and cheapest carrier of global trade .'
p16486
aS'investing in maritime sector is not only investing in ones own future ; but in the future of the planet and that of coming generations .'
p16487
aS'however , in this sector , no country can achieve the desired results in isolation .'
p16488
aS'nations have to collaborate to realize this potential and to overcome challenges in this sector .'
p16489
aS'the objective of this summit is to provide a platform and forum for such cooperation .'
p16490
aS'to conclude , i would like to say that : this is the right time to come to india ; it is even better to come through the sea route ; the indian ship is well equipped for a long haul ; dont miss it ; missing it means missing a pleasant journey and a great destination .'

aS'we are both aware that rapid spread of terrorism and radical ideology poses a common challenge to both our societies .'
p16502
aS'and , we also recognize that our close security partnership would help us to secure our peoples from these threats .'
p16503
aS'in our shared objective to combat these challenges , india is particularly grateful to thailand for its assistance and cooperation .'

p16510
aS'friends , trade and commerce flows are an important lifeline of the interdependent world today .'
p16511
aS'excellency and i agree that a more diversified commercial engagement between us would not only benefit both our economies .'
p16512
aS'it would also enable greater regional economic prosperity .'
p16513

p16514
aS'we encourage them , and the other business-sector stakeholders , to take lead in tapping the emerging business opportunities in both our countries .'
p16515
aS'alongside trade , there are also ample avenues for greater manufacturing and investment linkages .'
p16516
aS'we see a particular synergy between thai strengths in infrastructure , particularly tourism infrastructure , and indias priorities in this field .'
p16517
aS'information technology , pharmaceuticals , auto-components , and machinery are some other areas of promising collaboration .'
p16518
aS'we also see early conclusion of a balanced comprehensive economic and partnership agreement as our shared priority .'
p16519
aS'friends , prime minister and i are fully aware that smooth flow of goods , services , capital and human resources between our economies needs a strong network of air , land and sea links .'
p16520
aS'we have , therefore , prioritized completion of india-myanmar-thailand trilateral highway ; and early signing of the motor vehicles agreement between our three countries .'
p16521
aS'connectivity is also an area of priority for indias development .'
p16522
aS'improving access to southeast asia from our northeastern states benefits both our peoples .'
p16523
aS'friends , stronger connectivity is essential not just for expanding bilateral trade ties .'
p16524
aS'it also brings our people closer and facilitates enhanced science , education , culture and tourism cooperation .'

p16542
aS'in our culture , the shabd is treated as brahm ( god ) .'
p16543
aS'its capacity is as powerful as the almighty god .'
p16544
aS'the celebration of the 50 years of literary journey of dinkar jee is not merely due to the fact that 50 years have elapsed .'
p16545
aS'even after 50 years , his creative works continue to be a source of inspiration for us and for the future generations alike .'
p16546
aS'they view it with the same reverence and that is how it is worth all the respect .'
p16547
aS'those creating literature are known as litterateur because literature is a passion for them .'
p16548
aS'in the real sense , they are like saints .'
p16549
aS'whatever we have read about the sages in the vedas and the upanishads , they represent the same era .'
p16550
aS'they are visionaries , observe the society closely , weigh its various dimensions , mould the viewpoints and help us find a solution .'
p16551
aS'dinkar jis entire literature is associated with the farmers and their livelihood .'
p16552
aS'it is about the poor and the villages .'
p16553
aS'the creations find an audience , sometimes it touches the heart of the young , the elderly , men , women , sometimes a specific land area or a specific incident .'
p16554
aS'some of his creations have the ability to reach everyone from young to the old .'
p16555
aS'they can relate to the past , present and the future .'
p16556
aS'they touch the lives of not just those who read them but they resonate with the future generations as well .'
p16557
aS'such is the power of the writings of dinkar ji .'
p16558
aS'jai prakash narayan ji who revolutionized india was much older as compared to the young generation , and dinkar jis poems were like as a bridge between the two .'
p16559
aS'everyone is aware that that in the fight against corruption , the poems of dinkarji which prasoon ji just sang , would inspire the youth and awaken the country .'
p16560
aS'he would not let the society be a mute spectator .'
p16561
aS'not only this , he wont sleep in peace , as long as the society slept .'
p16562
aS'he wanted to keep the society alert by awakening its conscience and by revolutionizing its spirit .'
p16563
aS'he did not find freedom in mere self expression .'
p16564
aS'he wanted that the flame inside him should spread everywhere , but he did not visualize it as a destructive force capable of burning everything , but as an inspirational light that would guide the future generations .'
p16565
aS'this is a rarity .'
p16566
aS'i am a worshipper of goddess saraswati and hence i am able to experience the power of the spoken word .'
p16567
aS'i know how some words can be so powerful so as to change the course of lives and i can very well feel that strength within me .'
p16568
aS'as a worshipper and a priest i know that dinkar ji has given us an invaluable gift and we will have to see how we take it forward to future generations .'
p16569
aS'i sometimes feel that in our country there might be thousands of poets and lovers of literature in every generation .'
p16570
aS'i believe that there might be literature lover in thousands who might be reciting dinkar jis creations by heart .'
p16571
aS'this by no means is a small achievement .'
p16572
aS'some people recite the shlokas from ramayana , mahabharata , vedas and upanishads .'
p16573
aS'similarly there might be others who would be orally reciting dinkar jis words .'
p16574
aS'they might be finding pleasure in the same , in lending voice to dinkar jis creations .'
p16575
aS'they might be thinking that people may or may not hear me but the world will definitely hear dinkar ji .'
p16576
aS'dinkar ji created parshuram ki pratiksha .'
p16577
aS'his creations had inputs from history as well as cultural sensitivities , the greatness demonstrated by india at various points and the capacity to imbibe everything .'
p16578
aS'the way dinkar ji experienced it is reflected time and again through his creations .'
p16579
aS'and this way we can open insightful windows through his literature into an understanding of india .'
p16580
aS'if we have the potential we can open doors too .'
p16581
aS'but if there is no potential , we can at least open the windows .'
p16582
aS'dinkar ji has laid the foundation of such a potential amongst us .'
p16583
aS'dinkar ji told us a few things but perhaps we like to forget them , and people forget them .'
p16584
aS'time and again , some vices creep into the society .'
p16585
aS'they are different every time .'
p16586
aS'someone tried once to be close to dinkar ji citing that he belonged to the same caste .'
p16587
aS'he wanted dinkar ji to support him .'
p16588
aS'this happens many a times in the society .'
p16589
aS'but in such situations too , how apt was his thinking , we get a glimpse of it , otherwise most people fall prey to such things .'
p16590
aS'dinkar ji was member of the rajya sabha and had a chance to both view and experience politics closely , yet he kept himself aloof from such an environment .'
p16591
aS'he wrote a letter to the gentleman in 1961 that the only way out to improve the situation in bihar is that people should forget their caste and come together to respect the merit .'
p16592
aS'remember the state does not run on the support of one or two castes .'
p16593
aS'it requires the support of many , and if we fail to rise above casteism then the social fabric of bihar will rot .'
p16594
aS'the letter written in 1961 , till date gives such an inspirational message for bihar .'
p16595
aS'these are not the words of a person in politics nor are they the words of a poet or literary person .'
p16596
aS'they are the words of a saint like man who could pre empt the future and who was worried about bihars future .'
p16597
aS'and that is why his words had the power to clearly indicate his intentions to the people of his society .'
p16598
aS'if bihar has to move forward , if bihar has to move ahead , then realize one thing , unless the eastern end of india develops , india can not surge ahead .'
p16599
aS'the western end however rich it is , can not make a difference until the eastern end of india joins the road to development .'
p16600
aS'our motherland can not realize its true potential till then .'
p16601
aS'it is our dream that the eastern end becomes equal to the western end and there is no reason why it can not do so .'
p16602
aS'if bihar , bengal , assam , north eastern states all rise and move forward then the world will watch in amazement , the progress made by india .'
p16603
aS'dinkar ji also had dreamt of the development of bihar .'
p16604
aS'bihar should be glorious , progressive and prosperous .'
p16605
aS'bihar may earn its own glory and pride and not borrow it from someone else .'
p16606
aS'it has the potential ; it just needs opportunities to become prosperous .'
p16607
aS'bihar has the strength , which given a chance it can leave everyone behind in the race .'
p16608
aS'we are committed to fulfill dinkar jis dream .'
p16609
aS'the journey of 50 years of his creations still inspires us to do something , not merely recite his verses .'
p16610
aS'it inspires us to achieve something , so today , in this auditorium , remembering his literary creations , we should see this as an opportunity to recommit ourselves .'
p16611
aS'may his blessings remain with us so that we may fulfill our commitments and move forward to the realization of the dreams of bihar ?'
p16612
aS'with these expectations i would like to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to be with you , to meet the family members .'
p16613
aS'i consider myself very fortunate .'
p16614
aS'thank you .'

aS'today , we meet to write new chapters in our engagement .'
p16740
aS'excellencies , the agreement on the establishment of a trilateral transport and transit corridor signed just a while ago can alter the course of history of this region .'
p16741
aS'it is a new foundation of convergence between our three nations .'
p16742
aS'the corridor would spur unhindered flow of commerce throughout the region .'
p16743
aS'inflow of capital and technology could lead to new industrial infrastructure in chahbahar .'
p16744
aS'this would include gas based fertilizer plants , petrochemicals , pharmaceuticals and it .'
p16745
aS'the key arteries of the corridor would pass through the chahbahar port of iran .'
p16746
aS'its very location , on the mouth of gulf of oman , is of great strategic significance .'
p16747
aS'afghanistan will get an assured , effective , and a more friendly route to trade with the rest of the world .'
p16748
aS'the arc of economic benefit from this agreement would extend beyond our three nations .'
p16749
aS'its reach could extend to the depths of the central asian countries .'
p16750
aS'when linked with the international north south transport corridor , it would touch south asia at one end and europe at another .'
p16751
aS'and , studies show that as compared to the traditional sea routes , it could bring down the cost and time of the cargo trade to europe by about 50 % .'
p16752
aS'over time , we could even look to connect it with the strong sea and land based routes that india has developed with the indian ocean region and south east asia .'
p16753
aS'excellencies , the world of 21st century offers unique opportunities .'
p16754
aS'but , it also poses its own set of challenges .'
p16755
aS'today , the nature of global engagement requires an attitude more suitable to this century , not the mindset of the century gone by .'
p16756
aS'today , the watch-words of international tiesare trust not suspicion ; cooperation not dominance ; inclusivity not exclusion .'
p16757
aS'this is also the guiding philosophy and driving spirit of the chahbahar agreement .'
p16758
aS'this will be a corridor of peace and prosperity for our peoples .'
p16759
aS'motives of economic growth , and empowerment would drive it .'
p16760
aS'it will build our security without making others vulnerable .'
p16761
aS'it would break barriers among our nations and encourage new benchmarks of people-to-people contacts .'
p16762
aS'and , help us to eventually build what we all desire and deserve - a friendly and healthy neighbourhood .'
p16763
aS'excellencies , the world around us is changing in fundamental ways .'
p16764
aS'and , the lack of comprehensive connectivity is not the only challenge that limits our national growth .'
p16765
aS'political turmoil and undercurrents of economic stress continue to spread in west asia .'
p16766
aS'in the indo-pacific , rise a mix of political competition and economic opportunities is putting pressure on the existing asian order .'
p16767
aS'global economy is yet to fully come out of uncertainty and weakness .'
p16768
aS'our present growth and future prosperity is under threat from the spread of radical ideas and physical terror .'
p16769
aS'amidst this landscape , our three countries are blessed with the most potent resourceour youth .'
p16770
aS'our three nations are estimated to have more than 60 percent of their population under 30 years of age .'
p16771
aS'they are an asset in our national and regional development .'
p16772
aS'we want them to walk the road to knowledge and skills ; industry and enterprise .'
p16773
aS'and , not fall victim to the path of guns and violence .'
p16774
aS'i am confident that economic fruits of the chahbahar agreement will expand trade , attract investment , build infrastructure , develop industry and create jobs for our youth .'
p16775
aS'the agreement will strengthen our ability to stand in mutual support against those whose only motto is to maim and kill the innocents .'
p16776
aS'its success will be a positive vote for peace and stability in the region .'
p16777
aS'excellencies , it is my strong belief that trade and transit routes should only be a starting point of our journey to greater connectivity .'
p16778
aS'in my vision , the full spectrum of connectivity agenda between iran , afghanistan and india should span : - from culture to commerce ; - from traditions to technology ; - from investments to it ; - from services to strategy ; and- from people to politics .'
p16779
aS'in a way , it is a pledge to : - realize the imperative of better connectivity ; - establish peace and create stability ; - build economic prosperity and engineer new trade ties ; - curb radicalism and remove shadows of terror ; and- break barriers and spread sweetness of familiarity among our people .'
p16780
aS'history will look back at this effort with nothing but approval and admiration .'

p16787
aS'let me begin by congratulating the ladies from these self-help groups , who are present here today and have just given me a glimpse of their immense talent .'
p16788
aS'the promotion of self help groups has got a boost from the deen dayal antyodaya yojana .'

p16799
aS'i am told that the state governments meghalaya mission football aims at detecting talent at the grass-root level and providing support for grooming and nurturing promising children and youngsters as professional footballers .'
p16800
aS'i am sure that the football stadium being constructed at a cost of 38 crore rupees with the support of the ministry of development of north eastern region , will go a long way towards fulfilling this objective .'
p16801
aS'next year , that is in 2017 , india is hosting the under-17 fifa world cup .'
p16802
aS'we need to take advantage of this event being held in india ; and ensure the spread and development of this sport not only in the north eastern region , but also in other parts of the country .'
p16803
aS'meghalaya has a large number of football clubs and associations .'

aS'; and the indian meteorological department for setting up this radar in cherrapunji .'
p16811

p16812
aS'this weather radar system will enable better weather forecasts , especially for the north eastern region .'
p16813
aS'this should help in minimizing the threat posed by extreme weather conditions .'
p16814
aS'earlier today , i had an opportunity to participate in the north eastern council meeting and interact with the governors and chief ministers of this region .'
p16815
aS'this gave me an opportunity to get a glimpse of the development work being carried out in the north east .'

aS'much more still needs to be done .'
p16818

p16824
aS'the railway ministry plans to spend more than five thousand crore rupees during the current year for the same .'

aS'two projects covering all the eight north eastern states are being implemented at a cost of around ten thousand crore rupees for improving power transmission .'
p16841

p16842
aS'out of the 18,000 unelectrified villages in the country , we have already connected more than 7000 villages with electricity .'

p16862
aS'in order to boost industrial activity and employment under the north east region textile promotion scheme , one apparel and garment making centre is being set up in each of the eight states at a cost of rupees one hundred and forty five crores .'

p16868
aS'there is a tremendous opportunity for tourism , as well as adventure tourism , in the north eastern region , particularly , meghalaya .'
p16869
aS'we need to develop tourist circuits by providing better facilities to tourists , in terms of improved road connectivity , hotels , and cleanliness .'
p16870
aS'the union government has launched a new scheme of swadesh darshan , under which it is developing tourist circuits in the country .'
p16871
aS'one such circuit is proposed for the north east .'
p16872
aS'less than two years ago , on 2nd october , 2014 , the union government started its journey to create swachh bharat by october 2019 , as a tribute to mahatma gandhi , the father of the nation .'
p16873
aS'in exactly one year , from 15th august , 2014 to 15th august , 2015 , under the swachh bharat swachh vidyalay programme , we have constructed four lakh seventeen thousand toilets in over two lakh schools .'

S'the north eastern council was set up in 1972 .'
p16887
aS'since then it has contributed to the development of the north east region .'
p16888
aS'to meet the growing aspirations of the people , it is important that the north eastern council introspects and assesses the extent to which it has been able to achieve its objectives .'
p16889
aS'perhaps , there is a need to re-orient and upgrade the north eastern council .'
p16890
aS'you may like to consider developing the north eastern council as a state-of-the-art resource centre for the north eastern states with the necessary resources , knowledge and skills .'
p16891
aS'the resource centre may enable the states and the implementing agencies to properly plan and execute projects , promote research and innovations and provide strategic policy vision for the region .'
p16892
aS'the north eastern council may look into developing a specialised domain expertise either by itself or through an agency model to assist states and central ministries in their development planning as also problem solving needs .'
p16893
aS'this will enable the imbibing of good governance and best practices in the region .'
p16894
aS'the north eastern council should also consider focussing on issues in emerging areas of livelihood , entrepreneurship , venture funds , start-ups and skill development .'
p16895
aS'all this will help in generating jobs .'
p16896
aS'the government has been focussing on the development of the north east region through its pro-active act east policy .'
p16897
aS'as part of this policy , we are focussing on reducing the isolation of the region by improving all round connectivity through road , rail , telecom , power and waterways sectors .'
p16898
aS'if the western region of the country can develop , if other regions of the country can develop , i see no reason why the north east region of the country can not develop .'
p16899
aS'i am also convinced that india can move forward if all the regions develop including the north east region .'
p16900
aS'the north east region is also very important to us for strategic reasons .'
p16901
aS'and it is my conviction that we have to bring this region at par with the other developed regions of the country .'
p16902
aS'in the current budget , more than rs.'
p16903
aS'30,000 crores have been earmarked for the north east region .'
p16904
aS'it should be our endeavour to ensure that this money is spent well for the development of the region .'
p16905
aS'we believe in cooperative and competitive federalism .'
p16906
aS'states that are strong and want to grow further , need to be given adequate authority and resources .'
p16907
aS'and states that are not so strong , need to be given needful assistance .'
p16908
aS'it is in this regard that based on the report of the committee of chief ministers , we have decided to continue to provide assistance in the ratio of 90:10 for core central schemes and 80:20 for non-core schemes to the north eastern states .'
p16909
aS'in the recent past , we have established two important projects in assam - brahmaputra cracker and polymer limited and numaligarh refinery limiteds wax unit .'
p16910
aS'these are big projects that would create huge employment opportunities in the north east region .'
p16911
aS'however , it has taken us many years to complete these projects .'
p16912
aS'we have to ensure that we are able to complete our projects in time and without cost over-runs .'
p16913
aS'only then can we realise the true benefits of these projects .'
p16914
aS'the north east is the gateway to south east asia and we need to take advantage of this .'
p16915
aS'we are opening up both road and rail routes to our neighbouring countries .'
p16916
aS'this should give a boost to the economic development of the region .'
p16917
aS'we have created a specialised highways construction agency for the north east - the national highways and infrastructure development corporation - that was incorporated on 18th july 2014 .'
p16918
aS'since then it has set up its branch offices , one each in every north eastern state .'
p16919
aS'as of today , it is implementing 34 projects in the north eastern states covering a length of 1001 kilometres at a total cost of over rs .'
p16920
aS'10,000 crore .'
p16921
aS'in the road sector , we need to keep in view the special land and weather conditions of this area .'
p16922
aS'most of the north east areas get a lot of rainfall and are also prone to natural calamities and land-slides .'
p16923
aS'we thus need to be careful in using appropriate technologies in the construction of roads in this area .'
p16924
aS'we have recently implemented an improved internet connectivity project for the north east region in collaboration with bangladesh .'
p16925
aS'this will make available 10 gb of seamless alternate bandwidth for the region .'
p16926
aS'this integration will benefit the north east region tremendously .'
p16927
aS'the government is also making a heavy investment in power transmission projects covering all the eight north eastern states at a cost of around rs 10,000 crore .'
p16928
aS'this would ensure power to more areas .'
p16929
aS'the recent commissioning of bishwanath-chariyali-agra transmission line has also brought 500 megawatt additional capacity to the region .'
p16930
aS'the railways have undertaken a major expansion in the region at a cost of around rs 10,000 crore .'
p16931
aS'in november 2014 , arunachal pradesh and meghalaya were put up on the rail map .'
p16932
aS'agartala in tripura has also been connected with broad gauge line .'
p16933
aS'we are on the way to ensure that all the north east states come on the rail map soon .'
p16934
aS'in the north east , the indian railways has commissioned about 900 kilometres of broad gauge in the last two years , leaving only about 50 kilometres meter gauge lines to be converted in 2016-17 .'
p16935
aS'in addition , a 132 kilometre part of third alternative connectivity route to north east ( that is new maynaguri jogighopa ) has also been commissioned .'
p16936
aS'there are a number of strengths of the north east which we need to harness for healthy growth of the region .'
p16937
aS'all the states of the north east region are blessed with natural scenic beauty , distinct historical cultural and ethnic heritage .'
p16938
aS'all this offers tremendous scope for tourism in the region .'
p16939
aS'there is also a great scope for mountaineering , trekking and adventure tourism in the region .'
p16940
aS'if developed and promoted well , this can emerge as the biggest employer in the region .'
p16941
aS'it can also add to the growth and income of the region .'
p16942
aS'i understand that the ministry of tourism has identified a thematic circuit for the north east region .'
p16943
aS'i hope that the north eastern states will make the best use of the scheme to develop tourist circuits and attract tourists from all over the world .'
p16944
aS'the region can also look into combining a few popular destinations of the neighbouring countries with their tourism circuits .'
p16945
aS'this will be an added attraction for tourists .'
p16946
aS'the majority of youth of the north east region is english speaking .'
p16947
aS'with improved connectivity and language skills , you may look into setting up of the bpo industry in the region .'
p16948
aS'the government has approved north east bpo promotion scheme in the digital india programme for creation of employment opportunities .'
p16949
aS'the north east states must avail facilities and get these bpos operationalized in their respective states .'
p16950
aS'this will promote growth and provide jobs to our youth .'
p16951
aS'the north east is home to exotic fruits , flowers , vegetables , aromatic plants , and herbs .'
p16952
aS'most of them are organic in origin .'
p16953
aS'if we focus our development strategy on organic farming , it would help the region greatly .'
p16954
aS'a few months ago , i was in sikkim and participated in a function to declare sikkim as the first organic state in the country .'
p16955
aS'other states can take a lead from sikkim and the north east council can also play an important role in the development of organic farming in the region .'
p16956
aS'the north east can become the organic food basket for this country .'
p16957
aS'organic products are going to be increasingly used widely and if the north east council can assist the states in the region to take a lead in this area , it will contribute immensely to the income of the people and the region .'
p16958
aS'there is a large rural population in the north east region .'
p16959
aS'if we talk of assam alone , 86 % of the population lives in rural areas .'
p16960
aS'we have initiated the shyama prasad mukherjee mission to bring in economic , social and basic development of the rural areas in a cluster model .'
p16961
aS'it should be the endeavour of the regions states to make use of this mission for the development of the rural areas .'
p16962
aS'in the end , i would like to express my gratitude to the chairman and all the members of the north eastern council for successfully conducting the plenary meeting in shillong .'
p16963
aS'my special thanks to the governor and the chief minister of meghalaya for hosting this meeting .'
p16964
aS'i am sure that the deliberations in this meeting will go a long way in providing direction to the development of the region .'
p16965
aS'thank you .'
p16966
aa(lp16967
S'my dear countrymen , last time when i addressed mann ki baat , i was extremely distracted and upset by the earthquake that had struck then .'
p16968
aS'my mind did not allow me to speak , but still i spoke mann ki baat .'
p16969
aS'today , when i am addressing mann ki baat , we are all surrounded by severe hot weather , with all the heat related problems and news from all corners of the country .'
p16970
aS'i would like to request you all to take care of your health in this hot weather by following simple instructions , such as drinking ample amount of water and covering yourself for protection from the heat .'
p16971
aS'at the same time , i would also like to request you all to take care of the birds and animals in your neighbourhood and fulfill their requirements too .'
p16972
aS'we should take this opportunity to give the responsibility to our children to place a bowl of water for the birds in a suitable place where the water does not get heated up .'
p16973
aS'by doing this , i can assure you that your children will imbibe good moral and cultural values .'
p16974
aS'moreover , in this extreme heat , this act will be a life saver for the birds and animals too .'
p16975
aS'this summer season is marked on one side by the extreme heat conditions , while on the other side there is both happiness and sadness .'
p16976
aS'after completing our exams , we are in a state of anxiety until the announcement of the results .'
p16977
aS'now , cbse and the other boards have declared their results and i would like to congratulate each and every student who has passed with flying colours .'
p16978
aS'i came to know the significance of mann ki baat when many students , after obtaining their exam results , informed me that they listened carefully to my words on mann ki baat and followed them strictly during their exams , which has in turn proven to be quite fruitful and beneficial .'
p16979
aS'well friends , i am glad to know this through your letters .'
p16980
aS'however , the true reason behind your success is not any mann ki baat , but your hard work throughout the year and the consistent support from your entire family .'
p16981
aS'your school , your teachers and many others have a role to play in your success , and you have strived hard to attain this success , in order to meet everybodys expectations .'
p16982
aS'mann ki baat is a kind of exam tip given before entering the examination hall .'
p16983
aS'however , today i really enjoy the fact that mann ki baat has created a significant impact , and i am very happy about it .'
p16984
aS'while i speak about happiness surrounding our friends , who have passed with good scores , i would also like to make a mention of many of our friends who may have got low scores and some of them who were not successful .'
p16985
aS'to all those who have passed , i would like to remind them that they are in that stage of their lives where they can choose their career in the right direction .'
p16986
aS'now , you have the opportunity to decide that right path for your career according to your wish and capabilities .'
p16987
aS'please also remember that your future will depend on the path which you choose .'
p16988
aS'generally , i have observed that most of the students have no idea about what they should study , why they need to study , or where they should study .'
p16989
aS'they are also not aware of the aims in their lives .'
p16990
aS'many students mostly choose their career paths based on the opinions of their friends and families or based on the wishes of their parents .'
p16991
aS'our universe has expanded itself in all directions .'
p16992
aS'there are no limits for the choice of subjects or opportunities .'
p16993
aS'you must be careful and determined in choosing your career path , in accordance with your talent and capabilities .'
p16994
aS'why do you always have to choose the prevailing opportunities ?'
p16995
aS'try your best .'
p16996
aS'try to utilise the talents within you to gain new opportunities .'
p16997
aS'at the same time , you should also think how you can contribute to the betterment of your nation from what you have learned or what you become .'
p16998
aS'you will be shocked to hear about the fact that , as compared to the number of museums built around the world , the number of museums in india is very few .'
p16999
aS'it is very difficult to find the right staff members for these museums as it is not a conventionally popular field .'
p17000
aS'i do not want to drag on one topic .'
p17001
aS'however , my only point is that our nation is in dire need of excellent teachers , soldiers , scientists , as well as artists and musicians .'
p17002
aS'the field of sports is very broad , wherein other than players , various eminent human resources are also required for the fulfilment of any sports activity .'
p17003
aS'this proves that we are surrounded by a vast variety of fields and opportunities on this planet .'
p17004
aS'we all must try with strong determination .'
p17005
aS'your strengths , your capabilities , your dreams all should be aligned to the dreams of our nation .'
p17006
aS'this is your only chance to choose your right path .'
p17007
aS'to those who have not succeeded , i would like to tell them that success or failure is part of life .'
p17008
aS'those who consider failure as an opportunity , always head towards the foundation of success .'
p17009
aS'those who give up in life , due to failure , can never reach the heights of success .'
p17010
aS'we can learn a lot from our failures .'
p17011
aS'why not we believe that our failures can provide us the opportunity to know ourselves better and understand our strengths , and by knowing our strengths and talents , we will be able to choose the right path in life .'
p17012
aS'i am reminded of our nations ex-president , shri a.'
p17013
aS'p.'
p17014
aS'j.'
p17015
aS'abdul kalam .'
p17016
aS'in his book my journey- transforming dreams into action , he has mentioned an incident that took place in his life .'
p17017
aS'he says that he always aspired to become a pilot .'
p17018
aS'however , when he tried to become a pilot , he failed and could not clear his exams .'
p17019
aS'now , you can see that his failure gave him a great opportunity in his life .'
p17020
aS'he became a great scientist of our nation .'
p17021
aS'he became the president of india and his contribution stands unparalleled in the field of nuclear energy in india .'
p17022
aS'therefore , friends , please do not bend yourselves under the burden of failure .'
p17023
aS'failure is a kind of opportunity .'
p17024
aS'do not let the failure go without learning a lesson from it .'
p17025
aS'try to search for a hope and opportunity that lies hidden in your failure .'
p17026
aS'this is my humble request to all my young friends , and also to their family members if your son fails , please do not create an atmosphere which can force him to lose all hopes in his life .'
p17027
aS'sometimes , the childrens failure is associated with their parents dream which leads to various problems in future .'
p17028
aS'it should not happen .'
p17029
aS'fighting with failures can provide us the strength to live our lives peacefully .'
p17030
aS'i would once again like to congratulate all my young friends who have passed out with flying colours .'
p17031
aS'i would also like to convey my thoughts to my young friends who have failed , but i congratulate them to have obtained opportunities to find a right path in their lives .'
p17032
aS'please try and strive to move forward with hope and trust in your lives .'
p17033
aS'meanwhile , many incidents have happened since my previous mann ki baat .'
p17034
aS'our government has completed one year .'
p17035
aS'the entire nation analysed us quite minutely and criticised us .'
p17036
aS'many people gave us a distinction for our governance .'
p17037
aS'in democracy , i believe that it is very important to receive the feedback from the supporters and the opposition , in politics .'
p17038
aS'we must try to understand the drawbacks and the areas where we lag behind .'
p17039
aS'it is also beneficial to understand our merits .'
p17040
aS'in my case , i am happy with all that has happened so far .'
p17041
aS'my heart is always yearning to do something for the poor people in our country .'
p17042
aS'i always think of novel ideas and accept suggestions from others in order to help the poor .'
p17043
aS'last month , we launched 3 key policies to provide social security to the people of our society , i .'
p17044
aS'e .'
p17045
aS'prime ministers suraksha bima yojna , prime ministers jeevan jyoti bima yojna , and atal pension yojna .'
p17046
aS'it has been just twenty days since the launch of these policies , and i can proudly say that due to your trust in our nation , our government and our programmes and policies , the common citizens of our country have joined hands with us in such huge numbers .'
p17047
aS'i am extremely happy in sharing the fact that within a short span of 20 days , more than 8 crore and 52 lakhs people have registered their names for these programmes .'
p17048
aS'we have adopted important measures in the path of social security and it will act as a boon for the people in the future years .'
p17049
aS'for those who have not yet received this information , i would like to request them to acquire these benefits as soon as possible .'
p17050
aS'no one could have imagined receiving suraksha bima yojna by investing just one rupee per month or 12 rupees in a year .'
p17051
aS'in order to get the benefits of jeevan jyoti bima yojna , you need to invest just 330 rupees in a year , which is less than a rupee per day .'
p17052
aS'therefore , by using these benefits , the poor will not be dependent on others for their living .'
p17053
aS'the poor will become independent and self-confident .'
p17054
aS'we are adopting different measures in this direction .'
p17055
aS'i want to create an army of people , my army comprising of poor people will fight against poverty and defeat it .'
p17056
aS'our nation has been burdened with poverty for years now , and we will take appropriate steps to try and eliminate poverty from our nation .'
p17057
aS'we are sure we will succeed .'
p17058
aS'another most important development is the introduction of a channel for farmers on television , and i am feeling happy about it .'
p17059
aS'we have a number of channels on televisions in our country , such as cartoon channels , sports channels , news channels and entertainment channels .'
p17060
aS'for me , the channel for farmers is very important as i can clearly see the future of farmers through this channel .'
p17061
aS'according to my view , this channel is like an open university for farmers and their farms .'
p17062
aS'this is a channel where both students and teachers are farmers .'
p17063
aS'these farmers can learn a lot of things through excellent experience and move from traditional farming towards modern farming .'
p17064
aS'only minimal areas are left for farming .'
p17065
aS'the families of farmers are increasing in number , but the land area is reducing .'
p17066
aS'due to this problem , it is very critical to understand the ways to grow crops efficiently , in such small areas .'
p17067
aS'now , we can get details about the weather forecast and plan accordingly .'
p17068
aS'the channels for farmers will be focussing on these various issues .'
p17069
aS'my farmer brothers and sisters , a system for monitoring farmers has been arranged in each of our districts .'
p17070
aS'please contact the respective district heads for availing this benefit .'
p17071
aS'i would like to speak to my fisherman brothers and sisters , to all those who are involved with fishery .'
p17072
aS'there are many things for them to learn from this channel .'
p17073
aS'in india , animal husbandry has been a traditional segment in a villagers life , which acts as a supportive role in farming .'
p17074
aS'however , as compared to the number of animals and the amount of milk production in various countries around the world , india lacks far behind .'
p17075
aS'as compared to the numbers of animals , the estimated amount of milk production is not achieved in our country .'
p17076
aS'the process by which we can produce more milk per animal , the ways in which the animals can be taken care of and the types of food that should be provided to them , are some the important factors to be considered .'
p17077
aS'we take various measures based on our traditions , but we need to move forward by adopting scientific methods and technologies .'
p17078
aS'by adopting these scientific methods , farmers as well as the animal husbandry can help us achieve financial strength .'
p17079
aS'in this way we can provide confidence and power to the farmers and also the animal keepers .'
p17080
aS'we should get scientific guidance regarding the direction in which we should move forward and attain success in this area .'
p17081
aS'my dear countrymen !'
p17082
aS'do you remember this date , 21st june ?'
p17083
aS'generally , 21st june is remembered as the longest day of the year .'
p17084
aS'but , recently this date has gained a new significance in the world .'
p17085
aS'in september , last year , i had raised a subject and proposed to celebrate 21st june as international yoga day while addressing the united nations assembly .'
p17086
aS'the whole world was astonished , and you will also be surprised to know that within hundred days , we got support from 177 countries and this proposal was successfully passed .'
p17087
aS'in the history of united nations , such huge numbers of supporters from different countries were seen for the first time .'
p17088
aS'this proposal was passed in a very short span of time , with the support of various countries around the world .'
p17089
aS'this is a proud moment for every indian .'
p17090
aS'now , this is our responsibility .'
p17091
aS'would we have ever thought that yoga can act as a connecting link between nations ?'
p17092
aS'vasudhaiv kutumbakam implies that our ancestors had imagined the same , where yoga will act as a catalyst in connecting the world .'
p17093
aS'this is news of utmost happiness and pride for us .'
p17094
aS'but to achieve its real significance , we need to project the real essence of yoga , and its real strength , to the entire world .'
p17095
aS'yoga connects the heart and mind and acts as a medium for freedom from ailments and lust .'
p17096
aS'i am realizing that yoga connects the body , mind and knowledge .'
p17097
aS'now , it is has been widely proven that yoga can also act as a medium for connecting the world .'
p17098
aS'why are we not taking steps to become an ambassador for this venture ?'
p17099
aS'why not move forward in this path of human development with the help of this vital knowledge of yoga ?'
p17100
aS'we must celebrate 21st june as yoga day , in every corner of india .'
p17101
aS'please call up your relatives and friends staying in different parts of the world and ask them to gather in groups and celebrate yoga day .'
p17102
aS'if they have no knowledge of yoga , ask them to take help from books .'
p17103
aS'read and explain the importance of yoga in our lives .'
p17104
aS'you can also read various letters on yoga .'
p17105
aS'i strongly believe that by declaring yoga day , we have taken an important step in the development of the world .'
p17106
aS'we have contributed to human development by removing stress from the lives of people , by providing positive energy to those who have lost all hopes in their lives .'
p17107
aS'i want that what world has accepted , what world has respected , and what world has given to india should be a matter of pride , three weeks are left and you should take efforts and join and make others join .'
p17108
aS'i would especially like to speak to my soldiers of the army , who are fighting for our countrys safety .'
p17109
aS'they have joined the army for their living and have sacrificed their lives for our country .'
p17110
aS'here , i am not speaking to them as a prime minister , but from my inner self , inner truth and deep emotions that i have for my soldiers .'
p17111
aS'questions about one-rank and one-pension have not been resolved or answered for over forty years .'
p17112
aS'there is no denial from the truth that the previous governments have spoken about this issue , but have never done something about it .'
p17113
aS'i can assure you , and i have also promised my army men , that my government will surely launch one-rank and one-pension .'
p17114
aS'we know our responsibilities , and after the formation of our government , different departments have begun working on this issue .'
p17115
aS'i used to consider this to be a simple issue , but it is far more complicated than i thought , and for forty years this issue has been delayed .'
p17116
aS'in order to resolve this issue in a simpler direction , i have asked the government officials to find solutions to this problem .'
p17117
aS'it is not necessary to provide information to media every single second .'
p17118
aS'there is no requirement to run a commentary for this issue .'
p17119
aS'i would like to assure you , and i would like to repeat , that our government will launch one-rank and one-pension and provide solutions to all related issues .'
p17120
aS'your life is very important to us , owing to the thought-process and ideals , with which we are moving forward .'
p17121
aS'i would like to connect with you and help you , not just as a part of any government programme , or any political campaign , but as a reflection of my patriotism .'
p17122
aS'i , once again would like to convey to all the soldiers of my country , that we are not one of those people , who , in the name of politics , played games with you for the past forty years .'
p17123
aS'i am against this path , and i am not willing to take any step which would complicate the existing issues .'
p17124
aS'i want you to trust me , even if people are talking against us and playing games in the name of politics .'
p17125
aS'i would like to provide all the assistance to my people who are sacrificing their lives for the country .'
p17126
aS'these are my motives , and i believe that the words from my soul , which is made up of nothing but truth , will touch your heart as well .'
p17127
aS'you have kept your patience intact for forty years .'
p17128
aS'i need some time and opportunity to work .'
p17129
aS'once again , i would like to assure my countrymen that we will mutually work on this issue and find solutions for the same .'
p17130
aS'you all must have visited different parts of the country during vacations .'
p17131
aS'some of you must be planning now to visit places .'
p17132
aS'it is natural that seeing is believing .'
p17133
aS'when we visit places , we may go to our relatives place or go sight-seeing .'
p17134
aS'we get to explore and understand the world .'
p17135
aS'for a person , who has just seen a pond in his village , the experience of seeing an ocean can not be expressed in words .'
p17136
aS'he is unable to describe the size of ocean in front of the villagers , as seeing is altogether a different experience .'
p17137
aS'when in vacations while you are travelling , with friends or family or planning to go , i do not know if you have the habit of writing a diary while travelling .'
p17138
aS'i believe you must jot down your experiences when you meet new people and , you should write down in words all that influenced you .'
p17139
aS'when you see something , you should describe it in words .'
p17140
aS'in other words , you must assimilate what you see or feel , within you .'
p17141
aS'travelling is a form of knowledge in itself .'
p17142
aS'it is not possible for all of us to get a chance to climb the himalayas .'
p17143
aS'one must read the adventurous travel stories through the books written by those who have got a chance to visit the himalayas .'
p17144
aS'i am not saying that you should become a writer .'
p17145
aS'we should travel and write to learn something new , to understand our country , and to know its varied diversity .'
p17146
aS'we can write about a particular place , the food-habits of the people there , their clothing style , language , and culture , and also about their dreams , aspirations and problems .'
p17147
aS'we are living in this vast nation .'
p17148
aS'if we want to understand the entire nation , one life is not enough to do this .'
p17149
aS'it is my earnest request to all of you , who are planning to visit or travel , to share your travelling experiences with me .'
p17150
aS'i would be glad to read your stories .'
p17151
aS'i would request you to mail me your photo and your experience with incredible india # , and i will share your impressive stories with others .'
p17152
aS'i would like to feel what you have experienced .'
p17153
aS'i would to like see from far , what you have seen during your travel .'
p17154
aS'you can visit a sea shore and take a walk alone .'
p17155
aS'though i may be unable to do this , by reading your story , i would love to share your vivid experience with others .'
p17156
aS'on this note , let me remind you once again , please take care of yourself and do not fall sick .'
p17157
aS'there are many ways to protect yourself from the summer heat , but please take care of the birds and animals around you too .'
p17158
aS'i have spoken all that came out of my heart .'
p17159
aS'i will meet you all again , and will speak again .'
p17160
aS'my heartfelt greetings to one and all .'
p17161
aS'thank you all for your support .'
p17162
aa(lp17163
S'i am delighted to return to afghanistan ; honoured to be among people who have set the standard of courage for our age ; privileged to see again the high tide of friendship in this vast ocean of love for india .'
p17164
aS'this is yet another giant step in afghanistans march to progress .'
p17165
aS'and , it is a historic moment of emotion and pride in the relations between afghanistan and india .'
p17166
aS'thank you , mr president , for your invitation and for naming this dam as afghanistan-india friendship dam .'
p17167
aS'we are truly humbled by the generosity of the afghan spirit .'
p17168
aS'rivers have been bearers of great civilisations of the world .'
p17169
aS'in the flow of rivers runs the course of human progress .'
p17170
aS'in the holy quran , river is central to the image of paradise .'
p17171
aS'in the ancient scriptures of india , rivers defined our nation and were celebrated as the giver of life .'
p17172
aS'and , it is a wise afghan proverb that says , kabul be zar basha be barf ne : may kabul be without gold rather than snow .'
p17173
aS'for the snow feeds the rivers that sustain life and agriculture .'
p17174
aS'so , today , we are not just launching a project that will irrigate land and light up homes .'
p17175
aS'we are reviving a region , restoring hope , renewing life and redefining afghanistans future .'
p17176
aS'the dam is a generator not just of electricity but also of optimism and belief in the future of afghanistan .'
p17177
aS'the project would not just irrigate the fields of six hundred and forty villages in chiste , obe , pashtun zarghun , karokh , gozara , injil , zindjan , kohsan and ghoryan .'
p17178
aS'it would also bring light to over two hundred and fifty thousand homes in this area .'
p17179
aS'last december , in kabul , i was moved by the honour of inaugurating the afghan parliament building .'
p17180
aS'it was a tribute to the epic struggle of the afghan people to shape their future by vote and debate , not gun and violence .'
p17181
aS'on this summer day , in herat , we come together to honour and celebrate afghan determination to build a future of prosperity .'
p17182
aS'afghans and indians dreamt of this project in the nineteen seventies .'
p17183
aS'the lost decades speak to us about the ravages of a long drawn war .'
p17184
aS'it was a war not of afghan making , but it was one that stole the future of an entire generation of afghans .'
p17185
aS'and , when a new dawn broke over afghanistan in 2001 , we resumed the project .'
p17186
aS'with resolve and patience , courage and belief , we have together overcome distance and hurdles , threats and violence .'
p17187
aS'today , the brave afghan people are sending a message that the forces of destruction and death , denial and domination , shall not prevail .'
p17188
aS'they will not come in the way of the dreams and aspirations of the afghan people .'
p17189
aS'the fields that produce the finest fruits and saffron shall once again come alive with the clear waters of the river .'
p17190
aS'the homes that lived through dark nights of dread will now be lit by the power of hope .'
p17191
aS'men and women shall once again work the farms and ply their trade with the joy of hard work , in peace and security .'
p17192
aS'the shoulders that were once weighed down in the shadow of guns would now bear ploughs to turn the land green .'
p17193
aS'children shall again believe in the possibility of a future of education and opportunity .'
p17194
aS'and , another young girl poet will not have to live a life of pain , denial and longing , or see a life of promise cut short .'
p17195
aS'herat has time and again seen sublime glory and tragic ruin .'
p17196
aS'and , the city that once jalaluddin rumi held as the finest , will rise again .'
p17197
aS'the city that was the gateway to the west , south and central asia , will once again be the hub that will unite the regions in a peaceful pursuit of prosperity .'
p17198
aS'so , to the people and government of herat and the government of afghanistan , i express our deepest appreciation for your support , patience and understanding and , above all , your belief in us .'
p17199
aS'this dam has not been built by bricks and mortar , but by the faith of our friendship and the valour of afghans and indians .'
p17200
aS'and , at this moment of pride , we also stand in grief and gratitude for lives sacrificed so that afghan people will have a future they so richly deserve and so deeply desire .'
p17201
aS'the blood , sweat and tears of our people are mixed into this earth and have formed between us an eternal bond , written into the soil of this land .'
p17202
aS'bonds that remind us of ancient links between this region and india .'
p17203
aS'for many , the harirud river is one strand of our connected histories since the ancient vedic times .'
p17204
aS'today , the world will see the harirud river as an abiding emblem of our commitment to a shared future of progress .'
p17205
aS'and , the friendship dam unites us in solidarity as chishti sharif joined us in spirit centuries ago .'
p17206
aS'for , it is from here that the chishti silsila or chishti tradition of sufism came to india .'
p17207
aS'its glorious tradition and teachings resonate through the dargahs of ajmer , delhi and fatehpur sikri .'
p17208
aS'it draws people from all faiths with its message of love , peace , compassion ; of harmony among people of all beliefs ; of respect for all of gods creations ; and service to humanity .'
p17209
aS'indians and afghans know that these values , not extremism and violence , define afghanistan - a nation brimming with poetry of love and spiritual tradition of peace and harmony .'
p17210
aS'and , these are the values that give the great afghan people the patience and persistence to seek peace with their own who have chosen the path of violence and also with those who support them .'
p17211
aS'afghans have pursued this path , despite the strength of their belief that they can defend their freedom like no other people on this earth .'
p17212
aS'and , it is on the foundation of these values that afghans and indians seek each other , not because they harbour designs against another .'
p17213
aS'khwaja moiunuddin chishti , the first of the chishti saints in india , said that human beings must have the affection of the sun , the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth .'
p17214
aS'he not only had the magnificent landscape of his ancestral land in mind , he could also be describing the afghan people .'
p17215
aS'so , when i came to kabul in december , in the warmth of your welcome , i saw the kindness of your heart .'
p17216
aS'in your clear eyes , i saw the deep well of affection for india .'
p17217
aS'in your smiles , i saw the joy of this relationship .'
p17218
aS'in the firmness of your embrace , i felt the trust in our friendship .'
p17219
aS'and , in those memorable hours , india witnessed once again the grace of your people , the beauty of this land and the friendship of a nation .'
p17220
aS'today , i return with the gratitude and admiration of 1.'
p17221
aS'25 billion people .'
p17222
aS'and , a renewed pledge for our partnership .'
p17223
aS'together , our partnership has built schools , health centres and irrigation facilities for rural communities .'
p17224
aS'it has empowered women with skills and the youth with the education to shoulder the responsibility for afghanistans future .'
p17225
aS'we have joined hands to build roads that bridge the distances of your country , from zaranj to delaram , and transmission lines that bring power to your homes .'
p17226
aS'now , indias investment in the port at chahbahar in iran will give afghanistan a new route to the world and a new path to prosperity .'
p17227
aS'and , to implement that vision , just last month , president ghani joined president rouhani of iran and me in witnessing the signing of the chahbahar trade and transit agreement between afghanistan , iran and india .'
p17228
aS'the fruits of our friendship are not confined to kabul , kandahar , mazar and herat .'
p17229
aS'they will never be .'
p17230
aS'our cooperation will extend to every part of afghanistan .'
p17231
aS'our partnership will benefit every section of afghan society .'
p17232
aS'because across its difficult geography , and across its diversity , and beyond the identities as pushtuns , tajiks , uzbeks and hazaras , afghanistan must live and prosper as one .'
p17233
aS'for , divisions among afghan people will only help those who seek to dominate the nation from outside .'
p17234
aS'as we work together , we draw strength and confidence from your deep commitment to protect our partnership from the designs of others .'
p17235
aS'when our people are under attack , the brave afghans guard us as their own .'
p17236
aS'they put themselves in the line of fire so that their indian friends are safe .'
p17237
aS'this is the nobility of your heart and the strength of your friendship .'
p17238
aS'i have seen this from the moment i assumed office as prime minister .'
p17239
aS'for on that day , when terrorists launched a massive attack on our consulate in this city of herat , the heroic efforts of afghan soldiers , and of our personnel , saved many lives and prevented a big tragedy .'
p17240
aS'mr .'
p17241
aS'president , friends , afghanistans success is a deeply held hope and desire of every indian .'
p17242
aS'it comes from the love and admiration for afghans in our hearts .'
p17243
aS'we want to see your democracy strike deep roots ; your people unite ; and , your economy prosper .'
p17244
aS'we want to see your art , culture and poetry thrive .'
p17245
aS'and , we want to see your cricketers join the ranks of test players and also seek glory in ipl .'
p17246
aS'but , it also comes from the recognition that when afghanistan succeeds , the world will be safer and more beautiful .'
p17247
aS'when the values that define afghans prevail , terrorism and extremism will be in retreat .'
p17248
aS'because we know that extremism and terrorism can not stop at your border or end at the boundaries of our region .'
p17249
aS'so , in the spreading unrest of our times , the world can not forget the brave struggle that the afghan people are waging - for themselves and our world .'
p17250
aS'india will not forget or turn away .'
p17251
aS'as i said then , and i will say it again , your friendship is our honour ; your dreams are our duty .'
p17252
aS'indias capacity may be limited , but our commitment is without limits .'
p17253
aS'our resources may be modest , but our will is boundless .'
p17254
aS'for others , their commitments may have a sunset clause , but our relationship is timeless .'
p17255
aS'we face barriers of geography and politics , but we define our path from the clarity of our purpose .'
p17256
aS'we see resistance and suspicion of others , but our resolve is strong and your faith and trust guides us forward .'
p17257
aS'where some doubt your future , we are certain that no force or power can deny the afghan people the destiny they have chosen , however long and hard the journey may be .'
p17258
aS'so , on international platforms and in regional forums , we will speak in one voice for the afghan right to a peaceful , prosperous , united , inclusive and democratic nation .'
p17259
aS'and , in the fields , villages and cities of afghanistan , we will work together for that future .'
p17260
aS'and , whatever happens , in a bright or a dark moment , we will always experience , as herats great sufi poet , hakim jami , would say , the freshness and happiness of the gentle breeze of friendship .'
p17261
aS'thank you for this honour , this affection and this friendship .'
p17262
aS'thank you .'

p17270
aS'congress .'
p17271
aS'thank you , mr speaker for opening the doors of this magnificent capitol .'
p17272
aS'this temple of democracy has encouraged and empowered other democracies the world over .'
p17273
aS'it manifests the spirit of this great nation , which in abraham lincolns words ,  was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .'
p17274
aS'in granting me this opportunity , you have honoured the worlds largest democracy and its 1.'
p17275
aS'25 billion people .'
p17276
aS'as a representative of worlds largest democracy , it is indeed a privilege to speak to the leaders of its oldest .'
p17277
aS'mr .'
p17278
aS'speaker , two days ago , i began my visit by going to the arlington national cemetery -the final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land .'
p17279
aS'i honoured their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy .'
p17280
aS'it was also the seventy-second anniversary of the d-day .'
p17281
aS'on that day , thousands from this great country fought to protect the torch of liberty on the remote shores of a land that they did not know .'
p17282
aS'they sacrificed their lives so that the world lives in freedom .'
p17283
aS'i applaud india applauds , the great sacrifices of the men and women from the land of the free and the home of the brave in service of mankind .'
p17284
aS'india knows what this means because our soldiers too have fallen in distant battlefields for the same ideals .'
p17285
aS'that is why the threads of freedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies .'
p17286
aS'mr .'
p17287
aS'speaker , our nations may have been shaped by differing histories , cultures , and faiths .'
p17288
aS'yet , our belief in democracy for our nations and liberty for our countrymen is common .'
p17289
aS'the idea that all citizens are created equal is a central pillar of the american constitution .'
p17290
aS'our founding fathers too shared the same belief and sought individual liberty for every citizen of india .'
p17291
aS'there were many who doubted india when , as a newly independent nation , we reposed our faith in democracy .'
p17292
aS'indeed , wagers were made on our failure .'
p17293
aS'but , the people of india did not waver .'
p17294
aS'our founders created a modern nation with freedom , democracy , and equality as the essence of its soul .'
p17295
aS'and , in doing so , they ensured that we continued to celebrate our age old diversity .'
p17296
aS'today , across its streets and institutions , in its villages and cities , anchored in equal respect for all faiths ; and in the melody of hundreds of its languages and dialects .'
p17297
aS'india lives as one ; india grows as one ; india celebrates as one .'
p17298
aS'mr .'
p17299
aS'speaker , modern india is in its 70th year .'
p17300
aS'for my government , the constitution is its real holy book .'
p17301
aS'and , in that holy book , freedom of faith , speech and franchise , and equality of all citizens , regardless of background , are enshrined as fundamental rights .'
p17302
aS'800 million of my countrymen may exercise the freedom of franchise once every five years .'
p17303
aS'but , all the 1.'
p17304
aS'25 billion of our citizens have freedom from fear , a freedom they exercise every moment of their lives .'
p17305
aS'distinguished members , engagement between our democracies has been visible in the manner in which our thinkers impacted one another , and shaped the course of our societies .'
p17306
aS'thoreaus idea of civil disobedience influenced our political thoughts .'
p17307
aS'and , similarly the call by the great sage of india swami vivekananda to embrace humanity was most famously delivered in chicago .'
p17308
aS'gandhis non-violence inspired the heroism of martin luther king .'
p17309
aS'today , a mere distance of 3 miles separates the martin luther king memorial at tidal basin from the statue of gandhi at massachusetts avenue .'
p17310
aS'this proximity of their memorials in washington mirrors the closeness of ideals and values they believed in .'

p17318

p17319
aS'no wonder then that former prime minister of india atal bihari vajpayee called india and the u .'
p17320

p17321
aS'natural allies .'
p17322
aS'no wonder that the shared ideals and common philosophy of freedom shaped the bedrock of our ties .'
p17323
aS'no wonder then , that president obama has called our ties the defining partnership of the 21st century .'
p17324
aS'mr .'
p17325
aS'speaker , more than fifteen years ago , prime minister of india , atal bihari vajpayee stood here and gave a call to step out of the shadow of hesitation of the past .'
p17326
aS'the pages of our friendship since then tell a remarkable story .'
p17327
aS'today , our relationship has overcome the hesitations of history .'
p17328
aS'comfort , candour and convergence define our conversations .'
p17329
aS'through the cycle of elections and transitions of administrations the intensity of our engagements has only grown .'

p17382
aS'long before assuming office , i travelled coast to coast , covering more than 25 states of america .'

aS'today , mr speaker , a similar spirit animates india .'

aS'our 800 million youth , especially , are particularly impatient .'
p17388
aS'india is undergoing a profound social and economic change .'

p17392
aS'my to-do list is long and ambitious .'

p17415
aS'mr speaker , the 21st century has brought with it great opportunities .'
p17416
aS'but , it also comes with its own set of challenges .'
p17417
aS'inter-dependence is increasing .'
p17418
aS'but , while some parts of the world are islands of growing economic prosperity ; other are mired in conflicts .'
p17419
aS'in asia , the absence of an agreed security architecture creates uncertainty .'
p17420
aS'threats of terror are expanding , and new challenges are emerging in cyber and outer-space .'
p17421

p17422
aS'in this world full of multiple transitions and economic opportunities ; growing uncertainties and political complexities ; existing threats and new challenges ; our engagement can make a difference by promoting : cooperation not dominance ; connectivity not isolation ; respect for global commons ; inclusive not exclusive mechanisms ; and above all adherence to international rules and norms .'

p17427
aS'it can also help ensure security of the sea lanes of commerce and freedom of navigation on seas .'
p17428

p17434

p17438
aS'yet , distinguished members , not just in afghanistan , but elsewhere in south asia , and globally , terrorism remains the biggest threat .'
p17439
aS'in the territory stretching from west of indias border to africa , it may go by different names , from laskhar-e-taiba , to taliban to isis .'
p17440
aS'but , its philosophy is common : of hate , murder and violence .'
p17441
aS'although its shadow is spreading across the world , it is incubated in indias neighbourhood .'

aS'i commend the members of the u .'
p17443

p17444
aS'congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains .'
p17445
aS'refusing to reward them is the first step towards holding them accountable for their actions .'
p17446
aS'the fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels .'
p17447
aS'and , the traditional tools of military , intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight .'
p17448
aS'mr speaker , we have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it .'
p17449
aS'the need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation .'
p17450
aS"and , base it on a policy : that isolates those who harbour , support and sponsor terrorists ; that does not distinguish between  good '' and  bad '' terrorists ; and that delinks religion from terrorism ."
p17451
aS'also , for us to succeed , those who believe in humanity must come together to fight for it as one , and speak against this menace in one voice .'
p17452
aS'terrorism must be delegitimized .'
p17453
aS'mr .'
p17454
aS'speaker , the benefits of our partnership extend not just to the nations and regions that need it most .'
p17455
aS'on our own , and by combining our capacities , we are also responding to other global challenges including when disaster strikes and where humanitarian relief is needed .'
p17456
aS'far from our shores , we evacuated thousands from yemen , indians , americans and others .'
p17457
aS'nearer home , we were the first responders during nepals earthquake , in the maldives water crisis and most recently during landslide in sri lanka .'
p17458
aS'we are also one of the largest contributors of troops to un peace keeping operations .'
p17459
aS'often , india and the u .'
p17460
aS's.'
p17461
aS'have combined their strengths in science , technology and innovation to help fight hunger , poverty , diseases and illiteracy in different parts of the world .'
p17462
aS'the success of our partnership is also opening up new opportunities for learning , security and development from asia to africa .'
p17463
aS'and , the protection of environment and caring for the planet is central to our shared vision of a just world .'
p17464
aS'for us in india , to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient belief .'
p17465
aS'and , to take from nature only what is most essential is part of our civilizational ethos .'
p17466
aS'our partnership , therefore , aims to balance responsibilities with capabilities .'
p17467
aS'and , it also focuses on new ways to increase the availability and use of renewable energy .'

aS'a strong u .'
p17469

p17470
aS'support for our initiative to form an international solar alliance is one such effort .'
p17471
aS'we are working together not just for a better future for ourselves , but for the whole world .'
p17472
aS'this has also been the goal of our efforts in g-20 , east asia summit and climate change summits .'
p17473
aS'mr speaker and distinguished membersas we deepen our partnership , there would be times when we would have differing perspectives .'
p17474
aS'but , since our interests and concerns converge , the autonomy in decision making and diversity in our perspectives can only add value to our partnership .'
p17475
aS'so , as we embark on a new journey , and seek new goals , let us focus not just on matters routine but transformational ideas .'
p17476
aS'ideas which can focus : not just on creating wealth but also creating value for our societies ; not just on immediate gains but also long term benefits ; not just on sharing best practices but also shaping partnerships ; and not just on building a bright future for our peoples , but in being a bridge to a more united , humane and prosperous world .'
p17477
aS'and , important for the success of this journey would be a need to view it with new eyes and new sensitivities .'
p17478
aS'when we do this , we will realise the full promise of this extraordinary relationship .'
p17479
aS'mr .'
p17480
aS'speaker , my final thoughts and words would reiterate that our relationship is primed for a momentous future .'
p17481
aS'the constraints of the past are behind us and foundations of the future are firmly in place .'
p17482
aS'in the lines of walt whitman ,  the orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments , the baton has given the signal .'
p17483
aS'and to that , if i might add , there is a new symphony in play .'
p17484
aS'thank you mr speaker and distinguished members for this honour .'
p17485
aS'thank you very much .'
p17486
aa(lp17487
S'ladies & gentlemen , i am delighted to be here again amidst such a large and distinguished gathering of political and business leaders .'
p17488
aS'earlier today , i had the pleasure of meeting president obama and we shared our thoughts on a wide range of issues concerning our two nations .'
p17489
aS'indias bilateral relationship with the united states is stronger than ever and we both agreed that the future would be even brighter .'
p17490
aS'i am speaking to you at a time when the global economy continues to be weak .'
p17491
aS'several parts of the world are still facing very difficult conditions .'
p17492
aS'this is a time when the world needs new engines of growth .'
p17493
aS'from the point of view of the worlds oldest democracy , obviously it would be nice if the new engines are democratic engines .'
p17494
aS'i am happy to tell you that today india is poised to contribute as a new engine of global growth .'
p17495
aS'a larger indian economy has multiple benefits for the world .'
p17496
aS'obviously , india presents a large and growing market .'
p17497
aS'but india is much more than a market .'
p17498
aS'india isa reliable partner ; a source of high quality scientific , engineering and managerial talent ; a crucible of development ideas and experiments ; an efficient source of high quality r & d ; and a testimony that democracy and rapid growth can co-exist .'
p17499
aS'as india embarks on a new era of development , it needs to learn much from americas tradition of entrepreneurship and innovation .'
p17500
aS'america remains at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation fromair traffic control to air quality improvement , from drugs to drones , from hybrid cars to hydro fracking .'
p17501
aS'indeed , to me , america is not just a country with a great past ; it is a country with an exciting future .'
p17502
aS'i am therefore sure , that ours will be a partnership which sees both nations benefit .'
p17503
aS'a very unique feature of the indo-american relationship is the critical role of the indian-american community in the us economy .'
p17504
aS'it is rare that emigrants from one nation , who become immigrants in another , enjoy such high respect and repute in both countries .'
p17505
aS'indian-americans are a powerful cementing force in our growing economic and cultural ties .'
p17506
aS'i have just completed two years in office .'
p17507
aS'when i addressed you in 2014 , i had just taken over the reins of government .'
p17508
aS'we faced a particularly challenging domestic and external environment .'
p17509
aS'confidence of investors was at a low .'
p17510
aS'doubts were being expressed about the future of the indian economy .'
p17511
aS'the business community was unhappy with the inertia and stagnation that had set in .'
p17512
aS'there was frustration with archaic policies and red tape .'
p17513
aS'in 2 years , we have managed to overcome the odds and register an impressive economic performance .'
p17514
aS'i want to take this opportunity to describe to you the key elements of our policies .'
p17515
aS'i have said several times that my aim is to reform to transform .'
p17516
aS'for me , reforms are those policies that transform the lives of ordinary citizens .'
p17517
aS'in the last two years , we have taken a comprehensive package of reforms which go beyond more economic reforms .'
p17518
aS'i can classify them into four types .'
p17519
aS'first , macro-economic policies to create a strong foundation ; second , policies to stimulate growth and employment through investment and trade , and to increase efficiency and productivity ; third , policies to ensure that growth benefits the poor and the weaker sections of society , including women and farmers ; fourth , a frontal attack on corruption .'
p17520
aS'let me start with the macro-economy .'
p17521
aS'since we took office , inflation , the fiscal deficit and the balance of payments current account deficit have all fallen .'
p17522
aS'gdp growth , foreign exchange reserves , stock market valuations , and investor confidence have all increased .'
p17523
aS'this success is the result of a series of well thought out policies .'
p17524
aS'we have legislated a monetary framework with inflation targeting and an independent monetary policy committee to curb inflation .'
p17525
aS'we embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation and our fiscal deficit has been reduced substantially in each of three budgets so far .'
p17526
aS'even while cutting the fiscal deficit , we have greatly increased productive public investment .'
p17527
aS'this has been made possible in two ways .'
p17528
aS'firstly , we imposed carbon taxes on fossil fuels .'
p17529
aS'we took the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies .'
p17530
aS'we then replaced them with taxes .'
p17531
aS'a clean environment cess has been increased by eight times from rs.'
p17532
aS'50 per ton to rs.'
p17533
aS'400 per ton .'
p17534
aS'globally , there is much talk of carbon taxes but much of it is just that talk .'
p17535
aS'we have actually acted .'
p17536
aS'secondly we have reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods and use of technology .'
p17537
aS'subsidies are increasingly credited directly to bank accounts of the deserving with fool proof biometric identification .'
p17538
aS'let me now turn to our policies to stimulate growth and employment .'
p17539
aS'this audience is probably aware of the sweeping liberalization that we have undertaken in foreign direct investment .'
p17540
aS'we have put most sectors on automatic approval and opened up sectors like defence and railways to foreign investment .'
p17541
aS'the long pending insurance law reform was successfully passed .'
p17542
aS'several insurance companies , including american companies , have already enhanced their investment in the insurance sector .'
p17543
aS'we have taken major steps to increase the ease of doing business and have already begun climbing steeply in the global rankings .'
p17544
aS'we are encouraging foreign and domestic investors to set up high quality and efficient manufacturing facilities .'
p17545
aS'we have greatly enhanced investment in roads , railways , ports and waterways to improve logistics .'
p17546
aS'we have made major process improvements in our ports to reduce the time taken for cargo to enter and exit .'
p17547
aS'we admire the start up eco-system in your country .'
p17548
aS'we are making a beginning in replicating it .'
p17549
aS'our start-up india programme has stimulated a new breed of innovators .'
p17550
aS'in 2016 , bengaluru has become the fifth most preferred location for innovation centres .'
p17551
aS'it was not even in the top 10 in 2015.'
p17552
aS'for our economy to succeed , we need a strong banking system .'
p17553
aS'we inherited a system where cronyism and corruption were believed to be rampant in banking decisions and in appointments to public sector banks .'
p17554
aS'i held the first ever retreat of a prime minister with bankers .'
p17555
aS'we have set up clear performance measures and accountability mechanisms .'
p17556
aS'we are committed to ensuring adequate capital .'
p17557
aS'interference in banking decisions has ended .'
p17558
aS'a new process for appointments has been put in place under a bank boards bureau .'
p17559
aS'credible and capable bankers have been appointed to head banks .'
p17560
aS'for the first time since banks were nationalized 47 years ago private sector professionals have been appointed in key positions .'
p17561
aS'i now turn to our policies to ensure that growth is inclusive .'
p17562
aS'we have brought two hundred million people into the banking system through the jan dhan yojana .'
p17563
aS'this is more than the population of most countries in the world .'
p17564
aS'now , these millions are part of our banking system , and words like interest rate have a meaning for them .'
p17565
aS'these people have shown that there is great strength at the bottom of the pyramid .'
p17566
aS'believe it or not , accounts opened under the jan dhan yojana today have a total balance of almost six billion dollars .'
p17567
aS'the jan dhan yojana has also transformed the ability of the poor to make and to receive electronic payments .'
p17568
aS'every jan dhan account holder is eligible for a debit card .'
p17569
aS'indias banks and post offices are also being encouraged to operate mobile atms .'
p17570
aS'a mobile atm is one where cash can be drawn and simple banking tasks done through a hand held device .'
p17571
aS'we have provided a safety net through new social security schemes .'
p17572
aS'we have introduced three non-subsidised but low cost schemes covering accident insurance , life insurance and pensions .'
p17573
aS'because of their massive coverage the premia are low .'
p17574
aS'there are now over 120 million subscribers .'
p17575
aS'we have paid special attention to gender justice and to empowering women .'
p17576
aS'we have a new savings programme to help pay for girls education with a special high rate of interest .'
p17577
aS'to relieve rural women from the health hazards of cooking with firewood , we are giving 50 million new gas connections in poor rural areas .'
p17578
aS'under our new self-employment financing programme ( mudra ) , over 70 % of the beneficiaries are women .'
p17579
aS'more than 27 million new women-headed businesses have been assisted .'
p17580
aS'we have changed our policies to allow women in combat roles in the armed forces .'
p17581
aS'new rules are increasing the representation of women on corporate boards of directors .'
p17582
aS'agriculture remains indias mainstay in terms of providing livelihood .'
p17583
aS'there was a tendency to deprive farmers of subsidized fertilizer by diverting it for the production of chemicals .'
p17584
aS'a simple but very effective solution is neem-coating of fertilizer which makes it unsuitable for diversion .'
p17585
aS'we have moved towards universal neem-coating of urea .'
p17586
aS'it has already saved crores of rupees of diverted farm subsidies and improved fertilizer availability to farmers .'
p17587
aS'it is an example of how simple reforms can be very effective .'
p17588
aS'we have introduced a soil health card nationally , which tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil .'
p17589
aS'it enables the farmer to choose the best crop and right quantity and mix of inputs .'
p17590
aS'this greatly reduces wastage of inputs and increases crop yield besides protecting the soil .'
p17591
aS'by reducing unnecessary chemical inputs , it is also good for health of consumers .'
p17592
aS'it reduces costs , increases yields , improves the environment and protects the health of consumers .'
p17593
aS'140 million soil health cards will be issued , requiring a collection of over twenty-five million soil samples , and tested through a nationwide network of nearly 1500 laboratories .'
p17594
aS'this brings me to an achievement that i think even our worst critics do not dispute .'
p17595
aS'this is the change in levels of corruption .'
p17596
aS'for many years , economists and other experts have held corruption to be one of the main constraints on the growth of any developing economy .'
p17597
aS'we have taken decisive steps to curb corruption .'
p17598
aS'i have already referred to what has been done in public sector banks .'
p17599
aS'we removed discretion in allocation of key resources and moved to transparent auctions of mines , spectrum and fm radio licenses and we have plugged leakage through direct benefit transfer .'
p17600
aS'we have revamped our personnel management to ensure that senior positions are held by persons of integrity .'
p17601
aS'we have launched an on-going campaign against tax evasion and black money .'
p17602
aS'the poor are the greatest beneficiaries of the reduction in corruption .'
p17603
aS'looking to the future let me outline what i see as the path we will follow in the coming years .'
p17604
aS'firstly , we will continue to have disciplined and prudent macro-economic policies .'
p17605
aS'i firmly believe that sound macro-economic fundamentals are a necessary foundation for long term sustainable growth .'
p17606
aS'secondly , we will combine this with a continued stress on inclusion and equity .'
p17607
aS'this is to ensure the fruits of development accrue not to a few , not to many but to all indians .'
p17608
aS'and this will also mean continuing our attack on corruption .'
p17609
aS'thirdly , we will continue to make progress on improving the investment climate and ease of doing business .'
p17610
aS'we want to make india a destination which not only welcomes business but where it is easy to do business .'
p17611
aS'we have largely achieved the first by drastically liberalizing our foreign direct investment policies .'
p17612
aS'we have made a good beginning on the second and will continue to make further improvements .'
p17613
aS'we will continue to strengthen the  make in india initiative .'
p17614
aS'it is not intended for only manufacturing for the domestic market or import substitution .'
p17615
aS'it is as much about making world-class products and services for the whole globe .'
p17616
aS'that is why , for us , improvements towards free trade are important .'
p17617
aS'it is very important for us that developed countries open their markets , not only to goods from countries like india but also to services .'
p17618
aS'i see this as a win-win proposition for the u .'
p17619
aS's.'
p17620
aS'and for india .'
p17621

aS'our societies have been enriched by links of culture , cusine and commerce .'
p17698
aS'they form the bed rock of our modern day relationships with russia , china and the countries of central asia .'
p17699
aS'excellencies , with india as its full member , sco boundaries would stretch from the pacific to europe ; and from the arctic to the indian ocean .'
p17700
aS'we would represent forty percent of humanity and over a billion youth .'

p17702
aS'india has always enjoyed good relations with the eurasian land mass .'
p17703
aS'we also share global goals of stability , security and prosperity in the asia-pacific .'
p17704
aS'india would no doubt benefit from scos strengths in energy , natural resources and industry .'

aS'in turn , indias strong economy and its vast market could drive economic growth in the sco region .'
p17706
aS'indias capacities in trade , investments , information and communication technology , space , s & t , agriculture , health care , small and medium scale industry can bring wide spread economic benefit to the sco countries .'
p17707
aS'we can partner to develop human resources and institutional capacities in the region .'

p17723
aS'with the same goal in sight , a stable , independent and peaceful afghanistan is not just a sincere desire of each afghan .'
p17724
aS'it is also necessary for greater security and stability in the sco region .'
p17725

aa(lp17731
S'my dear countrymen , my greetings ( namaskar ) to you alllast year , we had to endure so many trials - the scorching heat of the summer , scarcity of water , drought conditions and so on .'
p17732
aS'however , the past two weeks have been the harbinger of the welcome news of rainfall from different places , bringing in its wake a feeling of freshness .'
p17733
aS'you too must have felt it .'
p17734
aS'going by the predictions of the scientists , this time there should be good rainfall , far and wide and throughout the rainy season .'
p17735
aS'this news in itself charges us with a lotof enthusiasm .'
p17736
aS'i extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall .'
p17737
aS'in our country , like the toiling farmers , our scientists are also achieving success on many fronts to take our country to new heights .'
p17738
aS'i have believed it right from the beginning that the new generation should nurture the dream of becoming scientists , should have keen interest in science , and our youngsters should step forward with the zeal to do something for the coming generations .'
p17739
aS'i also want to share another bright news with you .'
p17740
aS'yesterday i had gone to pune , on the occasion ofthe anniversary of the smart city project .'
p17741
aS'over there i met those students of the pune college of engineering , who on their own have made a satellite , which was launched on 22nd june .'
p17742
aS'i had called them to meet me , as i had a wish to see these young friends of mine , to interact with them and to experience firsthand the energy and enthusiasm within them .'
p17743
aS'for the past many years , several students have made their contributions to this project .'
p17744
aS'in a way , this academic satellite is aliving example of the soaring flight of courage and ambition of the young india .'
p17745
aS'that has led these our students to make this satellite .'
p17746
aS'the dreams behind this small satellite are big and lofty ; they soar high into the sky ; the efforts put in by them are very intense .'
p17747
aS'on similar lines as achieved by these pune students , the students of satyabhama university of chennai in tamil nadu also created their satellite ; and their sathyabamasat has also been launched .'
p17748
aS'we have been hearing these thingssince childhood , and every child wishes deep inside his heart to touch the sky and grab a few stars .'
p17749
aS'keeping this in mind , in my opinion , these two satellites made by the students and launched by isro , are extremely important and most valuable .'
p17750
aS'all these students deserve hearty congratulations .'
p17751
aS'i also want to congratulate the people of the country that on 22nd june , our scientists at isro launched 20 satellites simultaneously into space , and in the process set a new record , breaking their own previous records .'
p17752
aS'and this is also a matter of joy that of the twenty satellites which were launched in india , 17 satellites were from other countries .'
p17753
aS'along with america , the satellites of many other countries were launched on indian soil by indian scientists and along with these , those two satellites made by our students also reached outer space .'
p17754
aS'and it is also noteworthy that owing to its guarantee of success with lesser cost , isro has carved its specialplace in the world .'
p17755
aS'and for this very reason , many countries of the world are today looking towards india for the launching of their satellites .'
p17756
aS'my dear countrymen , save the girl child , educate the girl child ( beti bachao , beti padhao ) , has already become the mann ki baat , the heartfelt wish of all the people of india .'
p17757
aS'still , some incidents infuse a new life into this slogan .'
p17758
aS'this time in the results of 10th and 12th classes , our daughters have been doing wonderfully well , which is a matter of pride .'
p17759
aS'and my dear countrymen , there is another significant event that all of us should take pride in .'
p17760
aS'on 18th june , the indian airforce for the very first time inducted its first batch of women fighter pilots .'
p17761
aS'you get goose pimples just at the mention of women fighter pilots ; we feel so proud that these three flying officer daughters of ours- avni chaturvedi , bhawna kanth and mohana , have achieved this great feat .'
p17762
aS'what these three daughters have accomplished is truly special .'
p17763
aS'flying officer avni is from rewa in madhya pradesh , flying officer bhawana is from begusarai in bihar and flying officermohana is from vadodara in gujarat .'
p17764
aS'you must have noticed that all these three daughters do not hail from metro cities of india .'
p17765
aS'they do not even come from the capital cities of their respective states .'
p17766
aS'despite hailing from small cities and towns , they nurtured dreams as high as the sky , and they also made them come true .'
p17767
aS'i extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters avni , bhawana and mohana as well as their parents .'
p17768
aS'my dear countrymen , a few days ago on 21st june , the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the international day for yoga .'
p17769
aS'as an indian , when we witness the entire world coming together through yoga , we realize that the entire world is getting linked with our past , present and future .'
p17770
aS'we are forging a unique bond with the rest of the world .'
p17771
aS'in india too , the international yoga day was celebrated at over 1 lakh places , with a lot of fervour andenthusiasm in myriad forms and hues , and in an atmosphere of gaiety .'
p17772
aS'i also got an opportunity to perform yoga in chandigarh amidst thousands of yoga lovers .'
p17773
aS'it was worth watching the zeal of the young and old alike .'
p17774
aS'you must have seen that last week the indian government issued a postage stamp on surya namaskar on the occasion of international yoga day .'
p17775
aS'this time , people all over the world , on yoga day , were witness to two special events .'
p17776
aS'one was at new york city wherethe united nations organisation -uno head quarters building is located .'
p17777
aS'a special projection depicting different postures of the various yoga asanas was organized on top of that building .'
p17778
aS'and passersby kept taking pictures of these , and these pictures soon were being shared all over the world .'
p17779
aS'tell me , which indian would not feel proud at such happenings ?'
p17780
aS'one more interesting thing happened .'
p17781
aS'technology is at work .'
p17782
aS'social media has created an identity of its own .'
p17783
aS'and this timetwitter carried out a light hearted pleasant experiment in yoga with its yoga imaging .'
p17784
aS'as soon as we typed hash tag yoga day , we would immediately get a picture of a yoga image on our mobile .'
p17785
aS'and this image too went viral all over the world .'
p17786
aS'yoga by itself means adding - getting connected .'
p17787
aS'yoga has the power to connect the entire world .'
p17788
aS'but for that to happen , first all of us need to get connected to yoga .'
p17789
aS'swati srivastava from satna in madhya pradesh , called me up on telephone after the yoga day and left a message for all of you but it seems that it pertains more to me : -sound byte : i wish that my entire country should be healthy and all the poor people also should remain free from diseases .'
p17790
aS'for this i want that among the many ads that are played on doordarshan , there should be one ad on yoga , how it is to be done , and what are its benefits ?'
p17791
aS'swati ji , your suggestion is very good , but if you observe carefully you will notice that not just on doordarshan , but these days in india and outside india too , the indian t .'
p17792
aS'v .'
p17793
aS'channels and channels of other countries are pitching in with their contribution to propagate yoga .'
p17794
aS'they all are shown at different times , but if you watch carefully , all these things are being done to disseminate information about yoga .'
p17795
aS'and i have seen that there are some countries in the world which have t .'
p17796
aS'v.'
p17797
aS'channels exclusively dedicated to yoga 24 hours a day .'
p17798
aS'and you probably know that , during the month of june , in view of the international yoga day , i used to share a video everyday of one particular asana of yoga through twitter and face book .'
p17799
aS'if you go to the website of the ministry of ayush , you will see available there a 40-45 minutes very good video demonstrating one after another , different kinds of yog asanas for different parts of the body that you can do , people of all ages can do .'
p17800
aS'to you and through you to all the people interested in yoga , i would like to exhort to get connected to it .'
p17801
aS'this time i have made an appeal .'
p17802
aS'when we say that yoga is a way to rid oneself of illnesses , then why dont we bring together all the different schools of thought of yoga , which have their own methods , their own priorities and their own experiences .'
p17803
aS'but all of them share the same final goal .'
p17804
aS'all the prevalent systems of yoga , all the functioning yoga institutions , all the different yoga gurus , i have urged all of them to run a successful campaign this entire year on how to defeatdiabetes through yoga .'
p17805
aS'can we control diabetes through yoga ?'
p17806
aS'some people have been successful in that .'
p17807
aS'everyone has searched for a wayin this regard .'
p17808
aS'and we know that there is no definite cure for diabetes .'
p17809
aS'one has to manage it with medicines .'
p17810
aS'diabetes is the master switch that triggers all other illnesses .'
p17811
aS'it becomes an entrance for many other diseases .'
p17812
aS'and so everyone is wary of diabetes .'
p17813
aS'a lot of people have worked in this direction .'
p17814
aS'some diabetic patients have also been able to controlit thorough their yogic practice .'
p17815
aS'why dont we share our experiences with other people to impart a momentum to this endeavour and create a kind of atmosphere for it for an entire year ?'
p17816
aS'i urge you to use hashtag yoga fights diabetes i repeat- hashtag yoga fights diabetes .'
p17817
aS'use this twitter handle and share your experiences on social media .'
p17818
aS'or send them to me on narendramodiapp .'
p17819
aS'let us see what the various experiences are .'
p17820
aS'at least , give it a try .'
p17821
aS'i invite you to shareyour experiences on hashtag yoga fights diabetes .'
p17822
aS'my dear countrymen , sometimes my mann ki baat is ridiculed a lot and is criticized much also .'
p17823
aS'however , this can only happen because all of us are committed to democracy .'
p17824
aS'but today , as i speak to you on 26th june , and i want to especially say this to the new generation that this democracy that we take pride in , this democracy that has granted great power to us , every citizen has been empowered .'
p17825
ag1044
ag1044
aS'but 26th june 1975 was also a day .'
p17826
ag1044
ag1044
aS'the night of 25th june and the next morning , wasa dark hour for the democracy of india when emergency was imposed in india .'
p17827
aS'all the rights of the citizens were suspended .'
p17828
aS'the country was turned into a prison .'
p17829
aS'lakhs of people along with jai prakash narain , thousands of leaders , many organisations were put behind bars .'
p17830
aS'many books have been written on that dark period .'
p17831
aS'many discussions have been held on it .'
p17832
aS'but today , as i talk to you all on 26th june , we should not forget that our strength lies in our democracy .'
p17833
aS'our strength lies in thepeoples power .'
p17834
aS'our strength lies in each and every citizen of our country .'
p17835
aS'we have to carry forward this commitment and make it stronger .'
p17836
aS'and it is this peoples power which has sustained democracy as its living embodiment .'
p17837
aS'there might have been locks on newspaper houses , radio might have been speaking just one kind of language , still on the other hand , given the opportune moment , the citizens give an example of the power of democracy .'
p17838
aS'a great example of the democraticstrength of the common people was witnessed during emergency .'
p17839
aS'and we must keep reminding our country of its democratic strength from time to time .'
p17840
aS'and our endeavour should be to make people aware of their power and to always have the tendency to further strengthen it by linking more and more people to it .'
p17841
aS'i always stress that democracy doesnt merely mean that people vote for you and give you the contract to run this country for five years .'
p17842
aS'certainly not !'
p17843
aS'voting is certainly animportant component but there are many other facets of democracy .'
p17844
aS'and the biggest dimension is that of peoples participation , their attitude , their thinking .'
p17845
aS'and the more the governments get connected with the people , the stronger they become .'
p17846
aS'the chasm between the governments and the people leads to ruin .'
p17847
aS'my endeavour has always been to ensure that the nation moves forward on the strength of peoples participation .'
p17848
aS'recently , when my government completed two years of functioning , some young people of modern thinking suggested , when you talk such big things about democracy , then why dont you get your government rated by the people also .'
p17849
aS'in a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice .'
p17850
aS'but that stirred my mind .'
p17851
aS'i raised this topic with some of my senior colleagues .'
p17852
aS'their first reaction was , oh no !'
p17853
aS'sir !'
p17854
aS'what are you thinking of doing ?'
p17855
aS'these days technology has changed so much that ifpeople get together and form a group and if they decide to misuse technology , then who knows in which direction they might take forward this survey .'
p17856
aS'they thus expressed their concern .'
p17857
aS'but i felt , no , we should go ahead even if it is a risk .'
p17858
aS'we should give it a try and see what happens .'
p17859
aS'now a lot of surveys are conducted after the elections , during the elections , at other times also over some issues , sometimes to gauge the popularity , but the sample size of these surveys is not verybig .'
p17860
aS'however , my dear countrymen , i am happy to state that when i , through the medium of technology , using different languages , appealed to the masses to rate my government , a lot of people amongst you have expressed your opinion on rate-my-government-mygov .'
p17861
aS'in .'
p17862
aS'lakhs of you displayed your interest in this but 3 lakh people devoted their time and put in serious effort for giving an answer to each and every question .'
p17863
aS'i am grateful to these 3 lakh people that they displayed a lot ofself initiative in rating the government .'
p17864
aS'i wont discuss the results .'
p17865
aS'our media persons are sure to do that .'
p17866
aS'but i can say for sure that it was a good experiment .'
p17867
aS'and this was a matter of joy for me that people speaking all the languages of india , residing in every corner of the country , hailing from all types of background .'
p17868
ag1044
ag1044
aS'all of them participated in it .'
p17869
aS'and the biggest thing was .'
p17870
ag1044
ag1044
aS'and this , of course , came as a surprise to me .'
p17871
ag1044
ag1044
aS'that maximum number of people took part in thisexercise through the portal of the website of the rural employment scheme which is being run by the government .'
p17872
aS'thus , my primary impression is that there has been a large and active participation of people connected to rural india and poverty issues .'
p17873
aS'this i liked the most .'
p17874
aS'so you have seen that while on 26th june some years ago the voice of the people was stifled , now is the time , when the people make their decisions , they judge whether the government is doing the right thing or not , is performing well or poorly .'
p17875
aS'this is the real power of democracy .'
p17876
aS'my dear countrymen , today i want to make a special appeal for one thing .'
p17877
aS'there was a time when taxes were so pervasive , that it became a habit to avoid taxation .'
p17878
aS'there was a time when there were many restrictions imposed on bringing foreign goods into the country which gave rise to a lot of smuggling .'
p17879
aS'but gradually , times have changed .'
p17880
aS'now it is not very difficult for the taxpayer to get connected with the taxation system of the government .'
p17881
aS'but even then , old habits die hard .'
p17882
aS'onegeneration still feels that it is best to keep away from the government .'
p17883
aS'today i want to impress upon you that we end up losing our peace of mind by trying to escape from rules and regulations .'
p17884
aS'as a result , anybody can trouble and harass us .'
p17885
aS'why should we let this happen ?'
p17886
aS'why dont we , on our own , give the correct details of our income and property to the government , so that we can rid ourselves from the burden of hitherto undeclared assets ?'
p17887
aS'i appeal to the countrymen to dothis .'
p17888
aS'to the people who have undisclosed income , the government of india has given a chance to declare such income .'
p17889
aS'the government has presented before the country a special facility to disclose undisclosed income by the 30th of september .'
p17890
aS'we can be free ourselves of various burdens just by paying a fine .'
p17891
aS'i have also promised that for those who voluntarily declare to the government their assets and their undisclosed income , then the government will not conduct any kind of enquiry .'
p17892
aS'not once will it be asked as to from where all this wealth came and how it was acquired .'
p17893
aS'and so , this is a good chance for you to become a part of a transparent system .'
p17894
aS'at the same time , i want to tell the people of the country that pleaseconsider this plan , which is up to 30th september as your last chance .'
p17895
aS'in between , i had even told the members of the parliament that after 30th september if any citizen is put through any difficulty , the one who does not want to follow due rules of government , then it will not be possible to help them .'
p17896
aS'i want to say this to the people of the country that we do not wish that after the 30th september anything should happen that will cause difficulties for you .'
p17897
aS'and so i say that please availof this facility before this date and save yourselves from any possible trouble after the 30th of september .'
p17898
aS'my dear countrymen , i had to talk about this in mann ki baat today because recently i held a two-day conclave with the revenue departments- all the officials of the income tax , customs and excise departments .'
p17899
aS'and i have told them in clear words that we should not perceive citizens as crooks .'
p17900
aS'we should have trust and faith in the citizens .'
p17901
aS'we should hold hands with them .'
p17902
aS'if they want to follow rules , we should encourage them , and lovingly help them cross over .'
p17903
aS'it is important to buildan atmosphere of trust .'
p17904
aS'we shall have to bring about a change through our conduct .'
p17905
aS'we shall have to reassure the taxpayer .'
p17906
aS'i stressed this upon them and i noticed that they too realized that today when the nation is surging ahead , all of us must contribute to it .'
p17907
aS'and when i was taking inputs from them in this conclave , i gathered information which i want to share with you as well .'
p17908
aS'none of you will believe that in a country of 125 crore people , one and a half , only one and a half lakhpeople exist , whose taxable income is more than 50 lakh rupees .'
p17909
aS'nobody will be able to swallow something like this .'
p17910
aS'people having a taxable income of more than 50 lakh rupees can be seen in big cities in large numbers .'
p17911
aS'just looking at their bungalows worth 1 or 2 crores , one wonders how they can be in a tax bracket of less than 50 lakhs .'
p17912
aS'this means that there is something wrong somewhere .'
p17913
aS'we have to change this situation .'
p17914
aS'and this has to change before 30th september .'
p17915
aS'before takingany extreme steps , the government must give a chance to the people .'
p17916
aS'and so my dear brothers and sisters , this is a golden chance for you to disclose your undisclosed income .'
p17917
aS'and in another way , this is the way out to save yourself from any trouble that could arise after 30th september .'
p17918
aS'i urge you to come forth in this task for the betterment of our country , for the upliftment of the poor .'
p17919
aS'and i do not want that you should face any problems after 30th september .'
p17920
aS'my dear countrymen , the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country .'
p17921
aS'when i asked the people to give up their cooking gas subsidy , more than 1 crore families of this country voluntarily gave up their subsidy .'
p17922
aS'and now i want to cite an example especially for those people who have undisclosed income .'
p17923
aS'yesterday when i went to pune for the smart city programme , over there i got the chance to meet shri chandrakant damodar kulkarniand his family .'
p17924
aS'i had called them especially to meet me .'
p17925
aS'and what was the reason ?'
p17926
aS'anyone who has ever evaded tax , my words may or may not inspire that person , but the example of shri chandrakant kulkarni is sure to inspire him .'
p17927
aS'do you know what the reason is ?'
p17928
aS'shri chandrakant kulkarni is an ordinary man who belongs to an average middle class family .'
p17929
aS'he used to work for the government .'
p17930
aS'then he retired .'
p17931
aS'he receives a pension of sixteen thousand rupees .'
p17932
aS'and my dear countrymen , you will besurprised to hear , and those who are in the habit of evading tax will get a shock to know that chandrakant kulkarni ji , who gets a pension of only rupees sixteen thousand , some time back wrote a letter to me saying that out of his pension of 16,000 , he voluntarily wants to donate rs .'
p17933
aS'5000 per month for the cleanliness campaign .'
p17934
aS'and not just this , he sent me 52 cheques , post dated , which bear a date for each forthcoming month .'
p17935
aS'we certainly do not have any right to evade tax in thiscountry where there is one such government employee , who after retirement , out of a pension of mere sixteen thousand rupees , gives five thousand for the cleanliness campaign .'
p17936
aS'no one could be a greater source of inspiration than chandrakant kulkarni .'
p17937
aS'and for the people who are associated with the cleanliness campaign also , there could be no better inspiring example than chandrakant kulkarni .'
p17938
aS'i called chandrakantji face to face .'
p17939
aS'i met him and his life has touched my heart .'
p17940
aS'i express myfelicitations and admiration for the kulkarni family , i congratulate them .'
p17941
aS'and surely there must be countless people like them about whom i have no information .'
p17942
aS'these are the very people .'
p17943
ag1044
ag1044
aS'and this is the power and strength of the masses .'
p17944
aS'a man with a pension of sixteen thousand rupees sends me cheques worth two lakhs , sixty thousand in advance , is this a small thing ?'
p17945
aS'come , let us search deep down inside our hearts , and ponder over the fact that the government has given us anopportunity to disclose our incomes .'
p17946
aS'while thinking of chandrkant kulkarni , let us also follow him .'
p17947
aS'my dear countrymen , santosh negi from pauri garhwal in uttarakhand , has called up to relate one of his experiences .'
p17948
aS'he has given a message regarding water conservation .'
p17949
aS'friends , his experience can be of use to you as well : -sound byte : drawing inspiration from you , in our school , before the onset of monsoon we dug 250 small trenches which were 4 feet deep , along the side of the playground , so that rainwater could be collected in these .'
p17950
aS'this way the play ground remained unspoilt and there was no danger of children drowning in these .'
p17951
ag1044
ag1044
aS'and we managed to save crores of litres of rainwater which fell on the playfield .'
p17952
aS'santoshji , i would like to thank you for sending me this message .'
p17953
aS'pauri garhwal is a hilly area where you have done such splendid work .'
p17954
aS'you deserve congratulations for that .'
p17955
aS'the people of our country should certainly enjoy the rains but let us also be mindful that this is a holy gift from the almighty .'
p17956
aS'this is a limitless wealth .'
p17957
aS'we should make every effort to conserve every single drop of water .'
p17958
aS'how can we retain the rainwater of the villages there itself and similarly preserverainwater of cities therein .'
p17959
aS'to recharge mother earth once again , how can we replenish water back to the earth ?'
p17960
aS'if there is water today , only then can there be a tomorrow .'
p17961
aS'water is the basis of all life .'
p17962
aS'an atmosphere has certainly been created in the country .'
p17963
aS'lately , in all the states a lot of measures have been taken for water conservation .'
p17964
aS'but now that we are going to have the bounty of rain water , we must see to it that it doesnt just flow away .'
p17965
aS'we are so concerned about savinglives ; we should be equally concerned about saving water .'
p17966
aS'my dear countrymen , you already know that number 1922 .'
p17967
ag1044
ag1044
aS'it must have become a part of your memory by now .'
p17968
ag1044
ag1044
ag1044
aS'1-9-2-2 .'
p17969
aS'this 1922 is one such number that if you give a missed call to it , you can listen to mann ki baat in the language of your choice .'
p17970
aS'by listening to mann ki baat , at the time of your convenience , in the language of your choice , you too can make up your mind and resolve to contribute to the journey of the nations progress .'
p17971
aS'my namaskar once again to all my countrymen , thank you .'
p17972
aa(lp17973
S'your excellency , president filipe nyusiladies and gentlemen , excellency , i am deeply touched by your kind words .'
p17974
aS'thank you also for your thoughts on the strength of the mozambique-india relationship .'
p17975
aS'i would like to thank you as well as the government and the people of mozambique for their warm welcome and generous hospitality .'
p17976
aS'excellency , the relationship between our countries is not new .'
p17977
aS'thousands of indian-origin people call mozambique their home .'
p17978
aS'i am told that most of the siddi community that resides in parts of india is known to trace its ancestry to mozambique .'
p17979
aS'these communitiesare a living testimony to age old links that have connected our people , their ideas and traditions , and culture and commerce .'
p17980
aS'excellency , both our countries suffered under the colonial rule .'
p17981
aS'in the case of mozambique , the struggle was much longer .'
p17982
aS'independent india was one of the leading advocates of mozambican freedom from colonial rule .'
p17983
aS'we were proud to see mozambique join the ranks of free nations in 1975.'
p17984
aS'and , today , we applaud mozambique as one of the fastest growing economies of the world in recent decades .'
p17985
aS'excellency , as two developing countries we face similar challenges .'
p17986
aS'our development and economic partnership , therefore , has been an essential part of our relationship .'
p17987
aS'our trade and investment ties have particularly flourished in recent years .'
p17988
aS'we want to build further on it .'
p17989
aS'for this , india remains ready and committed to share its experiences , technology , capacity and concessional credit with mozambique , in line with your priorities .'
p17990
aS'last year marked the 40th anniversary of mozambican independence and of establishment of our diplomatic ties .'
p17991
aS'it also saw a level of interaction between our nations , never seen before .'
p17992
aS'its high point was your own state visit to india in august 2015 .'
p17993
aS'later , your prime minister honoured us with his presence during the third edition of the india-africa forum summit .'
p17994
aS'excellency , i am aware that i am the first indian prime minister to visit mozambique in 34 years .'
p17995
aS'this gap should neverhave been so long .'
p17996
aS'and , i am confident that it will not be so in future .'
p17997
aS'with these words , excellencies , ladies & gentlemen , please join me in raising a toast : to the health , happiness and well-being of his excellency , president filipe jacinto nyusi ; to lasting peace , progress and prosperity among the people of mozambique ; andto strong bonds of friendship and cooperation between india and mozambique .'
p17998
aa(lp17999
S'his excellency mr jacob zuma , president of the republic of south africa , honble minister of international relations and cooperation , honble minister of trade and industry , captains of south african and indian industry , ladies and gentlemen !'
p18000
aS'i am happy to be with you today .'
p18001
aS'india-south africa relations are built on a strong foundation of history .'
p18002
aS'we were directed together by destiny ; we are driven together by dreams .'
p18003
aS'our history had many common chapters .'
p18004
aS'with struggle and sacrifice , we changed the course of history .'
p18005
aS'fortunately , in this process , we had the guidance of the greatest leaders which the human race has seen .'
p18006
aS'friends , our leaders like nelson mandela and mahatma gandhi brought political freedom for us .'
p18007
aS'now , it is the time to work for economic freedom .'
p18008
aS'thus , our relations rest upon our common desire to fulfil the aspirations of our people .'
p18009
aS'we have been friends in adversities ; now we should franchise in opportunitieswith the blessings of our great leaders , both the countries have marched on the path of development .'
p18010
aS'both south africa and india are important players in the brics economies .'
p18011
aS'our people at home and the world at large are looking at us with great expectations .'
p18012
aS'we can join handsto fulfil these twin expectations .'
p18013
aS'it is heartening that we have had very active and fruitful engagement on all possible fronts .'
p18014
aS'this august gathering is also an important part of the same process .'
p18015
aS'friends , i admit that i am little late in visiting this great country .'
p18016
aS'however , president zuma and i have met several times in last two years .'
p18017
aS'south africa is indias key trade and investment partner .'
p18018
aS'in the last ten years , bilateral trade has grown almost 380 % .'
p18019
aS'the story of investments also continues to be bright .'
p18020
aS'there is continuous flow of investments both ways .'
p18021
aS'more than 150 indian companies are operating in south africa .'
p18022
aS'similarly , many companies of south africa are doing excellent work in india .'
p18023
aS'however , the scope is tremendous .'
p18024
aS'the potential is increasing day by day .'
p18025
aS'this is because both countries are strengthening their economic fundamentals .'
p18026
aS'therefore , we must look at ways to diversify our trade basket , to complement our needs and to serve the people .'
p18027
aS'our active partnership across various facets and forums is a testimony to the fact that such engagement is possible .'
p18028
aS'friends , for indian companies , south africa is a home in this continent .'
p18029
aS'many leading indian companies have a foot-print here .'
p18030
aS'they are engaged in a wide range of activities .'
p18031
aS'many indian ceos are here with us .'
p18032
aS'my advice to them is to see that their business results into socio -- economic transformation of this great country .'
p18033
aS'i have been advocating three ps for india .'
p18034
aS'( public sector , private sector and peoples partnership ) .'
p18035
aS'i have been emphasising on the personal sector .'
p18036
aS'the same applies here .'
p18037
aS'skill development and community empowerment should be central to your business plans .'
p18038
aS'the spirit of african humanism , ubuntu , should reflect in your business ethos .'
p18039
aS'this is equal to our philosophy of this is what mahatma gandhi stood for .'
p18040
aS'we have always believed in nurturing and nourishing not in exploiting .'
p18041
aS'encouraging fact is that our business engagement is not one way .'
p18042
aS'south african companies are also active in india .'
p18043
aS'many of them have presence on ground .'
p18044
aS'we have learnt from your knowledge and benefited from your innovative products .'
p18045
aS'south african business excellence and indian capacities must leverage each other ; for growth and development in our two countries .'
p18046
aS'friends , in last two years we have worked very hard on all fronts to set the economy right .'
p18047
aS'we have got very encouraging results of our sincerity and hard work .'
p18048
aS'today , india is a bright star in the global economy .'
p18049
aS'we are being seen as the engine of global growth .'
p18050
aS'india has become the fastest growing large economy in the world .'
p18051
aS'at a time of global slowdown , we have registered 7.'
p18052
aS'6 % growth in gdp .'
p18053
aS'world bank , imf and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days .'
p18054
aS'not only that , in 2014-15 , india contributed 12.'
p18055
aS'5 % of global growth .'
p18056
aS'its contribution to global growth is 68 % higher than its share of the world economy .'
p18057
aS'the fdi in this year has been the highest ever .'
p18058
aS'the ratings agency moodys has said that fdi inflows were all-time high in 2016 , highlighting the success of our make in india initiative .'
p18059
aS'make in india has become the biggest brand that india has ever had .'
p18060
aS'both within and outside the country , it has captured the imagination of people , institutions , industries , businesses , media and the political leadership .'
p18061
aS'as part of the make in india exercise , we have given emphasis on ease of doing business .'
p18062
aS'we have taken decisive steps to ease the licensing processes and rationalize the provisions relating to clearances , returns , and inspections .'
p18063
aS'if i talk of some other indicators : india has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions .'
p18064
aS'we have jumped 12 ranks in the latest global ranking by the world bank on ease of doing business .'
p18065
aS'india has also improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness .'
p18066
aS'against 15th so far , now we are at 9th place .'
p18067
aS'india has also jumped 16 places on the world economic forums global competitive index .'
p18068
aS'due to positive impact of our policies and practices , our confidence has gone up .'
p18069
aS'this also gives us motivation to further simplify our processes to become an easier place to do business .'
p18070
aS'an innovative start-up india programme has also been launched to incubate ideas and develop them into enterprises .'
p18071
aS'all this is having a good impact on expansion of job market and rise in purchasing power of the people .'
p18072
aS'this finally leads to india becoming a place with better quality of life and higher living standards .'
p18073
aS'we have ensured that our growth is inclusive and embraces both rural and urban communities .'
p18074
aS'we are taking a leap towards next generation infrastructure in both core areas and social sectors .'
p18075
aS'friends , socio-economic challenges of both our countries are more or less same .'
p18076
aS'my advice is that the wheels of development should not be re-invented .'
p18077
aS'our two countries are very uniquely positioned to complement each other .'
p18078
aS'for example : nature has been kind on both of us .'
p18079
aS'we have immense natural resources .'
p18080
aS'the need is to properly harness them and to use them sustainably for welfare of the common man .'
p18081
aS'we can learn a lot from each other in this .'
p18082
aS'we particularly want to engage with your world class mining companies .'
p18083
aS'some of them are already active in india .'
p18084
aS'but we want strategic engagements on this front .'
p18085
aS'our interest in this sector is not one sided .'
p18086
aS'v secondly , the challenge of climate change and the need of fast track development is before both of us .'
p18087
aS'we are both committed to clean and green pathways to progress .'
p18088
aS'at the same time , we need energy resources .'
p18089
aS'with the help of a number of countries , we have formed the international solar alliance .'
p18090
aS'i hope that we will enrich and take advantage of this forum .'
p18091
aS'our two countries have the unique benefit of opposite seasonswhen it is summer or mango season in india , it is winter here , and vice versa .'
p18092
aS'we can leverage this geographic advantage to market each others fruits , vegetables and other perishablesindia with its huge domestic market offers massive opportunities for your food processing industry .'
p18093
aS'our collaboration in this sector will bring value for our farmers and our villages .'
p18094
aS'we in india are working on very ambitious plans of infrastructure .'
p18095
aS'the task which is pending from the days of independence has to be completed fast now .'
p18096
aS'together , we can do a lot to fill these gaps .'
p18097
aS'india is best suited to help you in technology and skills .'
p18098
aS'efforts are already underway in these areas .'
p18099
aS'at the india africa forum summit held in new delhi last year , we under-took to educate and train 50,000 africans in india over the next five years .'
p18100
aS'these are just a few examples .'
p18101
aS'we can work together in a number of areas .'
p18102
aS'from defence to dairy ; from hardware to software ; from medicines to medical tourism ; from soft skills to science and technology .'
p18103
aS'there are opportunities for us .'
p18104
aS'india today is among the most open economies .'
p18105
aS'we have liberalised our fdi regime in most of the areas and in all possible ways .'
p18106
aS'we have rationalised our norms and made it simple for businesses to establish and grow .'
p18107
aS'friends , to conclude , i would like to say that we have added institutional depth to our partnership .'
p18108
aS'our brics business engagement and ceos forum have helped to expand and enrich our partnership .'
p18109
aS'today , we have successfully held the 3rd meeting of the india-south africa ceos forum .'
p18110
aS'we value your recommen- -dations and look forward to putting them into practice .'
p18111
aS'we are thankful to the south african government for introducing 10 year brics ( ) visa for regular business travellers .'
p18112
aS'the indian industry is quite encouraged by the move .'
p18113
aS'in february this year , we launched our e-visa programme for south africa .'
p18114
aS'this is valid for short term tourist and business travellers .'
p18115
aS'you can now get your visa for india sitting at home in your email , and that too free of cost !'
p18116
aS'friends , let us join hands once more ; let us commit ourselves together once again ; this is necessary to fight the enemy of poverty ; this is perhaps much more challenging ; but we have to succeed ; and this only can be our real tribute to our great leaders .'
p18117
aS'thank you .'
p18118
aa(lp18119
S'his excellency president of the republic of south africa , mrjacob zuma , friends , thank you , excellency , for your warm words of welcome and for your generous hospitality .'
p18120
aS'even though this is my first visit to this great country , my delegation and i already feel at home in this rainbow nation .'
p18121
aS'for this , excellency , we are deeply gratefulto you .'
p18122
aS'for me personally , this visit is an opportunity to pay homage to two of the greatest human souls to have ever walked this earth - mahatma gandhi and nelson mandela .'
p18123
aS'friends , through centuries , india and south africa have nurtured strong people to people ties .'
p18124
aS'we stood together in our common fight against racial subjugation and colonialism .'
p18125
aS'it was in south africa that gandhifound his true calling .'
p18126
aS'he belongs as much to india as to south africa .'
p18127
aS'friends , our shared values , suffering and struggles provide a strong foundation to our strategic partnership .'
p18128
aS'and , its success is visibleacross a range of sectors .'
p18129
aS'in our discussions today , president zuma and i reviewed the full spectrum of our engagement .'
p18130
aS'we agreed that in the last two decades , our relationship has been a story of strong advances and concrete achievements .'
p18131
aS'two way trade has grownby over 300 percent in last ten years .'
p18132
aS'indian companies hold strong business interests in southafrica .'
p18133
aS'about one fourth of our investments in africa are in this country .'
p18134
aS'and , there is potential to expand our business and investment ties further , especially in the areas of : minerals and mining ; chemicals and pharmaceuticals ; high-technology manufacturing ; andinformation and communication technology .'
p18135
aS'i am convinced that industry to industry ties can not only bring rich economic gains to our societies .'

aS'like in the past , our experiences and expertise are available for kenyas benefit .'
p18259
aS'excellency , we have a thriving economic and commercial relationship .'
p18260
aS'but , it is not a temporary or transactional relationship .'
p18261
aS'it is a time-tested bond , built on the foundation of shared values and shared experiences .'
p18262
aS'friends , both india and kenya have young populations .'
p18263
aS'both cultures value education .'
p18264

aS'of course , that includes me .'
p18282
aS'you see friends , when it comes to nation building , or nurturing ties with friends like kenya , my heart matches the youthful passion of any twenty year old .'

p18291
aS'just now , before entering this auditorium , i paid tribute to mahatma gandhi , whose statue at this university was unveiled exactly 60 years ago .'
p18292
aS'the connection between mahatma gandhi and this fine university is among early bonds of partnership between our two great nations .'
p18293
aS'it also echoes the value that our two societies place in having a strong education system for our national growth .'
p18294
aS'we have an ancient indian saying : , .'
p18295
aS'means : the wealth that increases by giving , that wealth is knowledge and is supreme among all possessions .'
p18296
aS"i am told you also have a swahili proverb : '' pesa , kama matumizi yake , huisha ; kujifunza , kama matumizi yake , huongezeka , that is , money if you use it , comes to an end ; but , learning if you use it , increases ."
p18297
aS'friends , kenya is a young nation in an ancient continent .'
p18298
aS'but , even as a young nation you pride in several firsts .'
p18299
aS'kenyas wangari maathai , the famous environmental activist , was the first african woman to win the nobel peace prize .'
p18300
aS'she was a product of this university .'
p18301
aS'lupita nyongo of kenyan origin is the first african to have won an oscar award .'

aS'we now have a version in india as well .'
p18312
aS'dear students , today , both kenya and india are flourishing democracies .'
p18313
aS'we are two developing nations that seek peace and prosperity for their peoples .'
p18314
aS'and , our ties are age old .'
p18315
aS'through centuries , the links of commerce and culture , trade and tradition , ideas and ideals , and beliefs and values have connected our societies .'
p18316
aS'and , in this , the warm waters of indian ocean have served as the bridge between our people .'
p18317
aS'i understand that there are 42 tribes in kenya and that people of indian origin are called the forty third tribe .'
p18318
aS'like the rich fabric of your society , india too has a long-standing tradition of celebrating its vibrant diversity .'
p18319
aS'indeed , along with democracy , freedom and equality , it is the very essence of modern india .'
p18320
aS'friends , last evening , president kenyatta and i had a memorable interaction with the indian diaspora .'
p18321
aS'many decades ago , they made kenya their home .'
p18322
aS'their affection and loyalty to kenya is foremost .'
p18323
aS'they are one of the most effective catalysts in the forward march of our ties .'
p18324
aS'and , this close inter-mingling of our people is a strong foundation for us to realize the promise of our modern day partnership .'
p18325
aS'friends , let us also not forget that together , india and africa represent a third of humanity .'
p18326
aS'contrary to what others might say , and there are many who might want to pull us down , we are by no means a minority in this inter-connected world .'
p18327
aS'we want to forge a lasting partnership : that does not rely on old models and rules of engagement ; one , which focuses on and empowers people ; one , where we share the fruits of each others economic prosperity ; one , which seizes the opportunities of twenty first century ; and , also responds to its challenges to bring safety and security to our societies ; and above all , serves the larger common good of the region and other developing nations the world over .'
p18328
aS'and , our partnership with kenya is an integral part of this vision of the twenty first century engagement with all of africa .'
p18329
aS'friends , among the rising african economies , kenya has been one of the strongest performers .'
p18330
aS'you are a land of strong traditions .'
p18331
aS'you are also a country with abundant opportunities .'
p18332
aS'on the other side of the indian ocean , at about 7.'
p18333
aS'6 % per annum , india is experiencing a great economic revolution .'
p18334
aS'given the depth and extent of our challenges , there is no option for both of us but to sustain the high economic growth rate .'
p18335
aS'this opens up a world of opportunities for us to work together .'
p18336
aS'not just in political sphere , but also in economic , social and developmental fields .'
p18337
aS'and , at several levels .'
p18338
aS'already , we trade with each other more than ever before .'
p18339
aS'with significant presence of indian companies in kenya , our investment partnership is robust , diverse and vibrant .'
p18340
aS'this , in turn , creates jobs for the young and educated in both our societies .'
p18341
aS'as flow of goods and capital between us increases , we must explore ways of working together to manufacture in different areas .'
p18342
aS'not just for kenya and india but for africa , and other regions .'
p18343
aS'health care is one area that immediately comes to mind .'
p18344
aS'indias experiences in this field can help build systems , institutions and capacities in kenya .'
p18345
aS'and , our engagement in specialized medical skills can be of particular purpose and importance to kenyas youth .'
p18346
aS'our growing trade ties in pharmaceuticals can be supplemented by manufacturing links .'
p18347
aS'they can respond to the health needs in kenya .'
p18348
aS'and , also meet the health care demands regionally .'
p18349
aS'kenyas future is in the hands of its youth .'
p18350
aS'similarly , you may be interested to know that indias drive towards its destiny is also fuelled by indias 800 million youth .'
p18351
aS'and for them , we have undertaken a nationwide campaign to create 500 million new jobs by 2022.'
p18352
aS'this , of course is not possible without skilling and educating our youth at a scale not seen before .'
p18353
aS'skill india and start up india are aimed at transforming the face of employment generation and personal enterprise in india .'
p18354
aS'we would be happy to share our capacities , experiences and abilities for the benefit of our kenyan friends .'
p18355
aS'we already have a robust cooperation in the field of institution and capacity building , especially in the field of education .'
p18356
aS'but , that is not enough .'
p18357
aS'the need of the hour is to diversify it to areas such as telecom , agriculture , energy and information technology .'
p18358
aS'areas that would not just propel and modernize our economies , but , also create jobs for our skilled youth .'
p18359
aS'our shared developmental challenges do not face the problem of scale .'
p18360
aS'and , between us we have the ability to generate access to cost efficient technologies .'
p18361
aS'm-pesa showed how , combined with technology , a home grown idea can quickly and effectively transform the lives of excluded sections of our society .'
p18362
aS'as our economies grow and our partnership thrives , we have a responsibility to ensure that it is not heavy handed on environment .'
p18363
aS'indeed , one of our shared values is respect for mother earth .'
p18364
aS'and , the nobel laureate wangari maathai captured it beautifully .'
p18365
aS'she said , and i quote ,  we need to promote development that does not destroy our environment .'
p18366
aS"'' our common tradition to live in harmony with nature is an ideal platform for us to build a partnership for  green africa ."
p18367
aS'a partnership that would also create new economic opportunities .'
p18368
aS'in fact , protection of our environment is the prime driver for india to shape an international solar alliance .'
p18369
aS'it is aimed at harnessing the power of sun as a permanent renewable source of energy .'
p18370
aS'the alliance , which currently enjoys partnership of over 120 countries , is also one of the emerging areas of our engagement with kenya .'
p18371
aS'similarly , indias ancient heritage of yoga stands for holistic living that is in tune with nature .'
p18372
aS'i am delighted to know that over 7,000 yoga enthusiasts celebrated this international yoga day on 19 june in the grounds of the nairobi university .'
p18373
aS'friends , a steady march towards our economic goals is indeed a priority .'
p18374
aS'but , we also can not ignore the safety of our people .'
p18375
aS'our economic prosperity and social development would mean a lot more , if our societies were safe and our people secure .'
p18376
aS'as president uhuru said in delhi in october last year , terrorism is  an evil that knows no boundary , has no religion , no race and no values .'
p18377
aS'indeed , we live in a world where preachers of hate and violence are threatening the fabric of our society .'
p18378
aS'as young dynamic citizens of kenya and as members of the african society , you would need to be watchful of those who spread radical ideologies .'
p18379
aS'and , be equally condemning of those who give shelter to terrorists and use them as political instruments .'
p18380
aS'youth can also play an important role in building a counter narrative to extremist ideologies .'
p18381
aS'students , as two maritime trading nations , and as members of the indian ocean rim association , we also need to stand guard against sea borne threats .'
p18382
aS'and , ensure that piracy does not threaten our trade and safety of our seafarers , and there is freedom of navigation for all .'
p18383
aS'on way to kenya , i had also visited mozambique , south africa and tanzania .'
p18384
aS'over millennia , the east coast of africa has had strong maritime links with india .'
p18385
aS'today , the same eastern coast is facing a complex set of strategic and security challenges .'
p18386
aS'the entire domain of maritime and coastal security is therefore mature for deeper engagement between our two countries .'
p18387
aS'dear students , this is the age of inter-dependence ; in this world of growing opportunities and complex challenges , you would inherit its tomorrow .'
p18388
aS'and , shape the future of this great country .'
p18389
aS'a safe and prosperous kenya and strong africa is your destiny .'
p18390
aS'let no one take it away from you .'

S'chief ministers and lt.'
p18404
aS'governors of states and union territories , and my cabinet colleagues , i welcome you all to this important meeting of the inter state council .'
p18405
aS'there are only a few occasions when the leadership of the centre and the states , assembles together .'
p18406
aS'this forum of cooperative federalism is the perfect setting to deliberate on the interests of the people , address their problems , and take collective and concrete decisions .'
p18407
aS'it highlights the vision of the makers of our constitution .'
p18408
aS'let me begin by recalling what our beloved former prime minister shri atal bihari vajpayee ji had said at this very forum sixteen years ago : in a democracy as big and diverse as ours , debate , deliberation and discussion help evolve policy that relates to the ground reality .'
p18409
aS'more importantly , they enable the effective implementation of such policies .'
p18410
aS'the inter-state council is an inter-governmental forum that can be used for evolving policy as well as ensuring its implementation .'
p18411
aS'i , therefore , urge the states to increasingly use this forum as an effective instrument to strengthen our democracy , our society and our polity .'
p18412
aS'the inter-state council is certainly the most significant platform for strengthening centre-state and inter-state relations .'
p18413
aS'there has been a long hiatus since the last meeting in 2006 , but i am happy that through the efforts of home minister rajnath singh ji , the process has been restarted .'
p18414
aS'over the last one year , he has convened meetings of five zonal councils .'
p18415
aS'the increased dialogue and connect has culminated in this gathering today .'
p18416
aS'the nation can progress only if the union and state governments walk shoulder to shoulder .'
p18417
aS'it would be difficult for any government to successfully implement a scheme on its own .'
p18418
aS'therefore , provision of adequate financial resources is as important as the responsibility for implementation .'
p18419
aS'with the acceptance of the 14th finance commission recommendations , the states share in central taxes has increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent .'
p18420
aS'this means that states now have greater financial resources to utilize in accordance with their requirements .'
p18421
aS'i am happy to share that the total amount received by states from the centre during 2015-16 is 21 per cent higher than the amount received in 2014-15 .'
p18422
aS'similarly , panchayats and urban local bodies will receive 2.'
p18423
aS'87 lakh crore rupees during the period of the 14th finance commission , which is substantially higher than last time .'
p18424
aS'the rights of states have been kept in mind , even in revenue received from the auction of natural resources , auctions of coal blocks will yield 3.'
p18425
aS'35 lakh crore rupees to states in the years to come .'
p18426
aS'auctions of other mines will yield an additional 18,000 crore rupees to states .'
p18427
aS'similarly , through amendments to campa act , we are attempting to free up about 40,000 crore rupees lying idle in banks , for disbursal to states .'
p18428
aS'the union government also wishes to share with states , the amount that is being saved as a result of transparency being introduced into the system .'
p18429
aS'kerosene is one example .'
p18430
aS'electricity connections are increasing in villages .'
p18431
aS'the union government will provide 5 crore new cooking gas connections over the next three years .'
p18432
aS'the supply of lpg will further increase .'
p18433
aS'all these efforts have a direct bearing on the consumption of kerosene .'
p18434
aS'recently , the chandigarh administration declared the city a kerosene-free zone .'
p18435
aS'now , the union government has launched a scheme , under which , if there is a reduction in the consumption of kerosene by a state , the centre will disburse 75 per cent of the resultant savings in subsidy , as grant to that state .'
p18436
aS'the government of karnataka , while moving swiftly on this initiative , has sent its proposal to the petroleum ministry .'
p18437
aS'this has been accepted and the grant has been disbursed to the state government .'
p18438
aS'if all states decide to reduce kerosene consumption by 25 per cent , and actually do so , they can receive about 1600 crore rupees as grant this year .'
p18439
aS'apart from centre-state relations , the inter state council is an appropriate forum to discuss matters which are of concern to large segments of our population .'
p18440
aS'how can we evolve consensus at the policy formulation stage ?'
p18441
aS'how can we address issues of mutual interest ?'
p18442
aS'therefore , in this meeting of the inter state council , besides the punchhi commission report , three very important subjects have also been added to the agenda .'
p18443
aS'one of these is aadhaar .'
p18444
aS'parliament has passed the aadhaar act-2016 .'
p18445
aS'the passage of this act enables us to use aadhaar for direct cash transfers for subsidy and other services .'
p18446
aS'as on date , 102 crore aadhaar cards have been distributed in our country of 128 crore people .'
p18447
aS'79 per cent of our people now have aadhaar cards .'
p18448
aS'among adults , 96 per cent people have aadhaar cards .'
p18449
aS'with your support , we shall connect every citizen of the country with an aadhaar card by the year-end .'
p18450
aS'today the simple aadhaar card has become a symbol of empowerment .'
p18451
aS'benefits now flow only to people genuinely entitled to receive them , with money getting directly credited to their bank accounts .'
p18452
aS'this has not only brought in transparency , but also resulted in savings of thousands of crores of rupees , which are being utilized for development .'
p18453
aS'friends , babasaheb ambedkar had written the path of social reform like the path to heaven at any rate in india , is strewn with many difficulties .'
p18454
aS'social reform in india has few friends and many critics .'
p18455
aS'the words written by him continue to be relevant even today .'
p18456
aS'therefore , eschewing criticism , we must lay emphasis on promoting social reform schemes through mutual cooperation .'
p18457
aS'many of these schemes have been designed by sub-groups of chief ministers under the aegis of the niti aayog .'
p18458
aS'another important area of discussion in the inter state council is education .'
p18459
aS'indias greatest asset is its youth .'
p18460
aS'more than 30 crore children are currently of school-going age .'
p18461
aS'hence , our country has the potential to provide the world with skilled manpower for many years to come .'
p18462
aS'the centre and the states must work together to provide our children an enabling environment in which they can develop their skills and prepare themselves for todays needs .'
p18463
aS'in the words of pt .'
p18464
aS'deen dayal upadhyay : education is an investment .'
p18465
aS'while planting trees , we do not charge them any fee .'
p18466
aS'we are aware that these trees will give us oxygen in the future , and benefit the environment .'
p18467
aS'likewise , education is also an investment that benefits the society .'
p18468
aS'pt .'
p18469
aS'deen dayal upadhyay ji said this in 1965 .'
p18470
aS'since then we have come a long way in terms of education .'
p18471
aS'but a lot still remains to be done with regard to the standard of education .'
p18472
aS'we must discuss the extent to which our system of education is genuinely educating our children .'
p18473
aS'the best way of improving the standard of education among children is to make them aware of the purpose of education .'
p18474
aS'merely going to school is not education .'
p18475
aS'education should generate curiosity among children .'
p18476
aS'it should teach them how to attain and enhance knowledge .'
p18477
aS'it should motivate them to continuously keep learning throughout their lives .'
p18478
aS'swami vivekananda also used to say that education does not mean merely attaining bookish knowledge .'
p18479
aS'the aim of education is character building .'
p18480
aS'education means strengthening the mind , and enhancing ones intellect , so that one can become self-reliant .'
p18481
aS'given the kind of efficiency and ability that is required in the economy of the 21st century , it is our responsibility to ensure that our youth are equipped with at least some skill-sets .'
p18482
aS'we have to prepare our youth to think logically , think out of the box , and work creatively .'
p18483
aS'internal security is another important issue on the agenda today .'
p18484
aS'we have to discuss internal security challenges confronting the country , the solutions to these challenges , and mutual cooperation in this regard .'
p18485
aS'the internal security of the country can not be strengthened until we focus on intelligence sharing , ensure greater coordination among agencies , and equip our police with modern approach and technology .'
p18486
aS'while , we have come a long way , we need to continuously increase our efficiency and capacity .'
p18487
aS'we must constantly remain alert and updated .'
p18488
aS'the meeting of the inter state council provides an opportunity for exchange of views in an extremely free and frank manner .'
p18489
aS'i am sure you will share your thoughts and suggestions on all the agenda items .'
p18490
aS'these will be of tremendous value .'
p18491
aS'the more we are able to forge consensus on these vital issues , the better we shall be able to tackle them .'
p18492
aS'in doing so , we shall not only strengthen the spirit of cooperative federalism and centre-state relations , but also secure a better future for our citizens .'
p18493
aa(lp18494
S'all the honourable spiritual masters and saints worth remembering in everyday morning and all the ardent devotees present here .'
p18495
aS'its my privilege that today ive got the opportunity to unveil the statue of inspirational personality most worshippable mahant avaidyanath ji maharaj as well as to receive the blessings of all of you .'
p18496
aS'this soil of gorakhpur holds a uniqueness in the sense be it lord budhha , mahavira or kabir , all of them had an unbreakable bond with this in one or another way .'
p18497
aS'the glorious tradition of guru gorakshanath ji ( gorakhnath ji ) was started with the great vision of upliftment and advancement of not just the individuals , but also of the society as a whole .'
p18498
aS'often , some ills or hurdles start gradually creeping into the traditions prevailing in the society over a long period of time .'
p18499
aS'however , if the ideals and rules of the traditions are fully observed , then it becomes possible to keep the traditions free from the circumstantial pressures .'
p18500
aS'gujarat boasts plenty of places linked with the brilliant tradition initiated by gorakhnath ji .'
p18501
aS'while being in gujarat , once i was sitting with mahant avaidyanath ji , as my association with him goes back to the time even when i was not active in the politics .'
p18502
aS'at that time , i came to know from him how in this time-honoured tradition , the entire system is conducted in an organised way , how its rules and policies are complied with , how the full information of the associated saints is retained , irrespective of the place of the world they stay at , how they are rendered financial support in time of rainy days .'
p18503
aS'since a long time , the gorakhnath tradition has been successfully kept alive and the credit goes to the signal contribution of those great personas who have got the good fortune to serve on this seat of monastery .'
p18504
aS'be it the freedom struggle of india or the significant task of social reconstruction post-independence , mahant avaidyanath ji played an active role in both time phases .'
p18505
aS'he had added an another dimension to his life by his vision to ignite the social consciousness through pilgrimage centre remaining within the democratic purviews and then provide the common people benefits of transformed situation .'
p18506
aS'this vision is being successfully kept up with and carried forward even today by his disciple yogi adityanath ji .'
p18507
aS'all the saint traditions , mathas ( monastic establishments ) and akharas ( religious bodies ) of india look sometimes fairly distinct and conflicting from the outside .'
p18508
aS'despite that , one thing is inherently common among all of them , that is never a poor or starving person returns hungry from their doors .'
p18509
aS'no matter , a saint has something or not in the life , if he is sitting in a hut , his first question from the approaching devotee is would you like to take the prasadam ( food offered to the god ) ?'
p18510
aS'such sorts of great traditions spring up out of the deep sensitivity towards the society and for that reason , such traditions inspire us devote our life and systems for the welfare and wellbeing of others .'
p18511
aS'and , it is the success mantra of our age-old indian traditions to last long proving their relevance in contemporary time periods .'
p18512
aS'all the traditions in our country have undergone timely changes .'
p18513
aS'they have embraced the science with open arms , whenever they felt its need .'
p18514
aS'even , they have welcomed the shift in their social outlook .'
p18515
aS'and , ive witnessed that how so many saints and seers , who were devoted to religious and spiritual works , have nowadays attached themselves towards furthering social missions like swacch bharat abhiyan .'
p18516
aS'ive even heard about the saints running campaign for building toilets and encouraging their devotees to do so .'
p18517
aS'ive heard them making a heartfelt plea from the people to uphold the dignity of our mothers and sisters and take up the task to ensure that women live a respectful life .'
p18518
aS'ive even seen so many saints , who run eye surgery camps for rendering whatever support to the poorest of poor that they can .'
p18519
aS'ive observed many saints who dedicate their lives for keeping animals healthy .'
p18520
aS'be it education , health or service , in each spheres of life , our saint tradition is getting involved today in one or other way .'
p18521
aS'and , it is the need of hour that lakhs of saints , thousands of traditions and hundreds of monasteries come forward to play a pivotal role in making india modern and prosperous , in cultivating good values among its citizens .'
p18522
aS'many are already doing it .'
p18523
aS'and it is something , which augurs good signs for the future of india .'
p18524
aS'each moment of mahant avaidyanath jis life was dedicated towards the pleasures and pains of the society .'
p18525
aS'he was deeply concerned towards it and used to make all-out efforts for exploring the ways to tackle social problems .'
p18526
aS'encouraging and rewarding the people engaged in good deeds was his lifelong task .'
p18527
aS'today , i had the good fortune to unveil the statue and pay floral tribute to such a great persona .'
p18528
aS'let me end my speech by saluting you all and the land of this gorakhnath temple , which is the land of severe penance , the land of ever-burning light ( akhand jyoti ) , the land of continuous inspiration and the land , which rewards those accomplishing noble tasks .'
p18529
aS'thank you very much .'
p18530
aa(lp18531
S'it is very happy to see that all our colleagues have expressed one voice and one sentiment .'
p18532
aS'today , when we talk of jammu & kashmir , we should talk about four parts of jammu & kashmir : jammu , kashmir valley , laddakh , and pak-occupied kashmir .'
p18533
aS'i am thankful to leaders of all political parties for the concerns they have expressed about the current situation in parts of jammu & kashmir .'
p18534
aS'the rich traditions nurtured by our democracy for last six decades have been biggest strength of unity and integrity of our country .'
p18535
aS'we may have some differences on some issues but when it comes to the integrity and sovereignty of the country , we all stand united .'
p18536
aS'like every indian , i have been deeply hurt by the recent incidents in jammu & kashmir .'
p18537
aS'it is very sad to see that children are not able to study , apple produce is not able to reach to the mandis , shopkeepers are not getting their daily income and government offices are not able to implement works of public interest .'
p18538
aS'the poor are the most affected lot by this situation .'
p18539
aS'our existence as the political worker is on account of the people .'
p18540
aS'they are our strength , sources of our energy ; in fact , peoples power is a vital part of our public life .'
p18541
aS'irrespective of whether a civilian or security force is injured or killed , the pain is felt by all of us .'
p18542
aS'my deep sympathies are with their families .'
p18543
aS'we are committed to provide better healthcare services to the injured ; we want to restore peace in the valley at the earliest possible so that people canlead their normal life , can earn their livelihoods , send their children to school and have a sound sleep at night .'
p18544
aS'we are committed for a permanent and peaceful solution to the issue of jammu & kashmir in accordance with the basic principles of our constitution .'
p18545
aS'we have an open mind and our doors are always open .'
p18546
aS'we are committed to the welfare of every citizen of jammu & kashmir .'
p18547
aS'we have been following the path shown by shri atal bihari vajpayee ji to find a solution .'
p18548
aS'jammu & kashmir is often said as crown of india .'
p18549
aS'in fact , jammu & kashmir is a symbol of age old commitment of equanimity towards all sects , where hindus , sikhs , buddhists and muslims have been living together for centuries .'
p18550
aS'the state of jammu & kashmir is the symbol of our founding fathers faith which defines us as one indian in spite of our diversity .'
p18551
aS'jammu & kashmir is not only a matter of our territorial integrity but also defines our nationality .'
p18552
aS'we can not deny the fact thatthe security forces have suffered all kinds of injuries and have been attacked in planned manner .'
p18553
aS'in spite of all this , our security forces have shown restraint .'
p18554
aS'the figures show that security personnel have been injured in large numbers .'
p18555
aS'even after misleading propaganda by certain elements in kashmir , the percentage of those spreading confusion & unrest ; and those instigating youth is very low in kashmir .'
p18556
aS'every kashmiri wants peace , has faith in democracy .'
p18557
aS'thats why even after intimidations by separatists elements during every election-which are like festivals of democracy ; the kashmiri public has expressed its faith in indian democratic system .'
p18558
aS'even just before the recent disturbances , highvoting was casts in the constituency of cm mehbooba ji .'
p18559
aS'therefore , it is far from being true to call it a public movement .'
p18560
aS'in some areas certain prohibitions were imposed in order to maintain law and order .'
p18561
aS'this is a legal way of maintaining law and order .'
p18562
aS'otherwise the lives of peace loving people will be affected adversely .'
p18563
aS'in reality , a common man was not troubled as much by such prohibitions , as he was troubled by continuous strikes declared by separatists elements .'
p18564
aS'during this period , the amarnath pilgrimage was going on nicely .'
p18565
aS'in addition , the state government continued to do special work on solar energy in laddakh region .'
p18566
aS'neet , cet , upsc civil services exams were organised as per schedule .'
p18567
aS'even all essential commodities were provided to citizens .'
p18568
aS'the up-coming period is perfect for tourism .'
p18569
aS'besides , the apple crop is about to arrive , which is of paramount importance for the livelihood of a common kashmiri .'
p18570
aS'certain separatist elementstaking advantage of this time want to disturb the peaceful environment and peace-loving citizens of kashmir .'
p18571
aS'the fundamental reason of disturbances in kashmir valley is cross-border terrorism promoted by our neighboring country .'
p18572
aS'due to terrorism normal life in kashmir valley is affected .'
p18573
aS'since the start of terrorist activities in kashmir in 1989-1990 , the security forces have achieved following : more than 34,000 ak 47 riffles were seized .'
p18574
aS'more than 5000 grenade launchers were seized .'
p18575
aS'around 90 lmgs were seized .'
p18576
aS'more then 12,000 revolvers were seized.'
p18577
aS'3 anti tank guns and 4 anti air craft guns were seized .'
p18578
aS'more than 350 missile launchers were seized.'
p18579
aS'63,000 kilograms of explosives including rdx and more than one lakh grenades were seized .'
p18580
aS'during this period more than 5,000 foreign terrorists were killed which is almost equal to the strength of 5 battalions .'
p18581
aS'when weapons have been seized in such huge numbers , so many foreign terrorists have infiltrated to eliminate people , therefore the world will never accept the false propaganda and lakhs of lies of pakistan .'
p18582
aS'pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens by fighter planes in its own land .'
p18583
aS'now the time has come that pakistan shall have to answer to the world for the atrocities committed by it against the people in baluchistan and pok .'
p18584
aS'we are fully committed to the fundamental rights of the people .'
p18585
aS'even our laws against terrorism are more humane , than any other democracy of the world .'
p18586
aS'our governments and our security forces have shown restraint in dealing with these incidents .'
p18587
aS'india will fight against terrorism with her full might and resolve .'
p18588
aS'it is our national duty .'
p18589
aS'to consider indias commitment to the rule of law , as a weakness , will be a mistake by the opponents .'
p18590
aS'india is determined to route out terrorism .'
p18591
aS'for us means and ends are both important and we are capable to adhere to them .'
p18592
aS'it is also a reality that kashmiri pandits have been displaced from kashmir valley who have been living there for centuries in their ancestral home .'
p18593
aS'this kind of atrocity against a particular community is the misdeed of terrorists trained and armed with weapons by pakistan and their sympathizers , but definitely not the deeds of those who believe in kashmiriat .'
p18594
aS'for the all round development of jammu and kashmir , a decision has been taken for a development package of more than rs.'
p18595
aS'80 thousand crore in consultation with the state government .'
p18596
aS'under this package not only roads and electricity projects have been included but also development of every region and every section of society of jammu and kashmir has been kept in mind .'
p18597
aS'this includes better facility for education of children , employment to youths , modern facility for treatment , facilities for promotion of tourism in the state and special facility for production of fruits in the state .'
p18598
aS'in order to provide employment immediately , the government has decided that 10 thousand special police officers ( spos ) , about 1200 para military and about 4000 candidates in 5 ir battalion will be recruited .'
p18599
aS'in addition , about 1 lakh 25 thousand persons will be trained under udan and himayat scheme so that unemployed people could get appropriate employment .'

p18608
aS'at a time when terrorism is spreading its wings across the world and when we are surrounded by terrorism instigated by our neighbor , we will have to fight united the war against terrorism .'
p18609
aS'the government has an expectation of constructive cooperation from all political parties in this matter .'
p18610
aS'all political parties while burying their differences will have to cooperate in this matter to restore peace and prosperity in the state .'

aS'but having won freedom after a period of subjugation ; we have made efforts to take the nation forward in this journey of seventy years .'
p18637
aS'sardar vallabh bhai patel united the nation .'
p18638
aS'now , it is the responsibility of all of us to take make this nation better .'
p18639
aS'we all have to work ceaselessly for the realization of the dream of one india , supreme india .'
p18640
aS'( ek bharat , shreshtha bharat ) .'
p18641
aS'brothers and sisters , we have not attained freedom for free of cost .'
p18642
aS'innumerable were the atrocities , but undeterred were our resolves also .'
p18643
aS'every indian was a soldier in the battle for freedom .'
p18644
aS'each one of them dreamt of an independent india .'
p18645
aS'may be every one of them was not fortunate enough to sacrifice , may be each of them was not fortunate enough to go to prison ; but every indian had a resolve and the leadership of mahatma ji and also the inspiration of countlessrevolutionaries who had sacrificed every thing .'
p18646
aS'all these movements contributed to our attainment of independence .'
p18647
aS'but , now we have to convert this freedom into the real freedom .'
p18648
aS'now , this is the resolve of the one hundred and twenty five crores of indians .'
p18649
aS'so , just as we did not attain our freedom without sacrifices ; we would not be able to attain the real freedom without renunciation , without human endeavour ( purusharth ) , without bravery , without dedication and discipline .'
p18650
aS'so , in order to take ahead this resolution of one hundred and twenty five crore indians ; all of us will have to move ahead with our specific responsibilities in a most committed manner .'
p18651
aS'be it a panchayat or the parliament , be it a village headman or the prime minister ; every one of us as well as every democratic institution will have to shoulder their responsibilities completely and perfectly .'
p18652
aS'only then we will be able to realize the dream of our the real freedom as soon aspossible .'
p18653
aS'this is correct to say that our nation is beset with many problems now- a- days .'
p18654
aS'but , we should never forget that if we have the problems , then we also have all the capacities to solve them .'
p18655
aS'so , if we move ahead with all our capabilities , we will find the ways and mean to solve all these problems .'
p18656
aS'so , brothers and sisters , if we have lakhs of problems , then we also have one hundred and twenty five crore brains also which are all capable to solve theseproblems .'
p18657
aS'dear brothers & sisters , there was a time when government used to be surrounded by aspersions .'
p18658
aS'but now time has changed .'
p18659
aS'at present , no aspersions are being leveled on the government .'
p18660
aS'rather , people have great expectations from it .'
p18661
aS'when the government is engulfed in expectations then it signifies hope and trust , which in turn generates those expectations .'
p18662
aS'expectations give pace towards good governance , invigorates and so the pledges are implemented ad continum .'
p18663
aS'mybrothers & sisters , today when i am addressing you from the rampart of the red fort , it is , therefore , but natural that we should discuss the journey of good governance , the work done by the government and work being done and should be done for the country .'
p18664
aS'i can present before you a very detailed account of work done and also multiple issues regarding the performance of the government .'
p18665
aS'during the tenure of two years , the government has taken innumerable initiatives andmultiple tasks have been done .'
p18666
aS'if i start giving details about them , i am afraid i will have to talk about it for a week from this very rampart of the red fort .'
p18667
aS'so instead of that temptation , i would like to draw your attention towards the work culture of the government .'
p18668
aS'sometimes , it is easier to present the account of work done .'
p18669
aS'but , it is not easy for a common man to comprehend , understand and identify the work culture without dwelling deep into the work culture .'
p18670
aS'my brothers & sisters , my countrymen , i would not talk solely about the policy , but also the intention and decisions of the government .'
p18671
aS'dear brothers & sisters , it is just not an issue of direction and outline , rather it is about holistic approach and a resolve for transformation .'
p18672
aS'it is confluence of trinity of expectation of people , democracy and support of people .'
p18673
aS'it is both wisdom and consent .'
p18674
aS'it is also pace and realisation of progress .'
p18675
aS'therefore , my countrymen , when i talk about the good governance , it does implies bringing in transformation in the life of common man of my country .'
p18676
aS'good governance meansthat the government should be sensitive , responsive and dedicated to the common man .'
p18677
aS'then only good governance gets the emphasis .'
p18678
aS'responsibility and accountability should be at the root of it and it should draw its vital energy from there only for the government to be sensitive , dear brothers and sisters .'
p18679
aS'we remember the days when there used to be a very long wait to go to any big hospital .'
p18680
aS'people used to come to aiims , spend two three days and then only it would be decided whatdiagnostic tests were to be done .'
p18681
aS'now we have been able to change this system .'
p18682
aS'registration is done online and the doctors appointment is also given online .'
p18683
aS'the processes start on arrival of the patient at the appointed hour itself .'
p18684
aS'not only this but all his medical records are also available online .'
p18685
aS'and we wish to develop it as a countywide culture in the field of medical treatment .'
p18686
aS'today this system has been put in place in 40 big hospitals of the country .'
p18687
aS'its basic premiseis that the government has to be sensitive .'
p18688
aS'dear brothers and sisters , the government should be accountable .'
p18689
aS'if it be not so then the problems of the common man are kept pending for solutions .'
p18690
aS'how does the change come ?'
p18691
aS'now technology is there , but there was a time when the railway ticket in the railways , concerning the common man and the poor was available only two thousand tickets per minute .'
p18692
aS'those who might have seen it , would know how the buffering used to be there , nobody knew when the website would be operationalagain , but today i have to say with satisfaction that now it is possible to have fifteen thousand tickets per minute .'
p18693
aS'the government should be accountable , it should take steps according to the necessities and expectations of the people .'
p18694
aS'there is a class across the country , particularly the middle class , higher middle class whom you see troubled more at the hands of the income tax officials rather than the police at times .'
p18695
aS'i have to change the situation and i am trying andi will certainly change it .'
p18696
aS'there was a time when a common and honest citizen used to give two rupees extra as a measure of caution at the time of paying his income tax .'
p18697
aS'he used to think that he might not be harassed , but once the money was deposited to the government exchequer , he had to run from pillar to post and seek recommendations for getting the refund .'
p18698
aS'it took months together before the rightful money of the citizen was returned to him from the government exchequer .'
p18699
aS'today , we have made a systemof issuing online refund .'
p18700
aS'today , refunds are given in one , two say or three weeks .'
p18701
aS'those who are hearing me today on tv , they would also be realising that they had not given any application , yet they had got refund directly into their account .'
p18702
aS'so , this responsibility and accountability are the results of these efforts .'
p18703
aS'it is equally important to lay emphasis on the transparency for good governance .'
p18704
aS'you know that a global relationship has already started to become a common thing in the society today .'
p18705
aS'a middle class man wants to have his passport- there was a time when about 40 lakh , 50lakh applications were received for getting passport .'
p18706
aS'today , approximately 2 crore people apply for the passport .'
p18707
aS'brothers and sisters , earlier 4-6 months were taken for scrutiny of applications if one did nothave recommendations .'
p18708
aS'we changed that situation and today , i can say with pride that passports are issued to the citizens with all genuine details , in about one or two weeks and there is transparency no recommendation is required and there is no dilly-dallying .'
p18709
aS'today , i can say , we have issued 1.'
p18710
aS'75 crores passports ( in 2015-16 itself .'
p18711
aS') in surajya there must be efficiency in governance and therefore , earlier , if a company had to set up a factory or desiring to do business in our country , applications were submitted .'
p18712
aS'there was a task of registration only , one wanted to do something for the country , but almost 6 months passed in normal course .'
p18713
aS'brothers and sisters , if efficiency is brought , then the same government , same rules , same officials have got geared up to perform the same task of company registration within 24hours and they are virtually doing it .'
p18714
aS'in the last july itself , they performed the task of more than 900 such registrations .'
p18715
aS'brothers and sisters , good governance is also necessary for surajya and the steps we have taken towards this good governance are that , as i had said last year from the red fort that we would exempt group c and group d posts from interviews , they might get job on the basis of merit .'
p18716
aS'we have detected almost 9,000 posts for which thousands and lakhs of people need to be recruited .'
p18717
aS'now , there would not be any interview process for these 9,000 posts , my young men would not need tospend any money for interviews .'
p18718
aS'recommendations would not be needed , roads for corruption and agents will be shut and this work has been implemented .'
p18719
aS'brothers and sisters , there was a time when a common man got satisfied if the government announced any plan or merely announced that this would be done , he used to think that something concrete would happen now .'
p18720
aS'then , a time came when people asked for the plan unless the drawing of the plan came .'
p18721
aS'then , there was a time when people asked for the budget .'
p18722
aS'today , the mood of the country has changed in 70 years .'
p18723
aS'it does not get satisfied with the announcement , it is notsatisfied by seeing the plan , if a budget provision is made , it is not ready to accept this .'
p18724
aS'it is accepted when things get implemented on ground and we can not bring things on ground with the old pace .'
p18725
aS'we have to speed up our work , increase the pace further and then we can say that we have done something .'
p18726
aS'rural roads are a perpetual issue in our country .'
p18727
aS'each rural citizen craves for pakka roads .'
p18728
aS'its a huge task .'
p18729
aS'atal behari vajpayi ji took this task specifically .'
p18730
aS'even succeding governments continued this and the work continued .'
p18731
aS'we have made efforts to fast track it .'
p18732
aS'earlier 70-75 km of rural roads were completed in a day .'
p18733
aS'now we have increased that pace up to 100km a day .'
p18734
aS'this pace will fulfil the aspirations of common man in the days to come .'
p18735
aS'we have aid emphasis on energy , specifically renewable energy in our country .'
p18736
aS'that was a time , when after so many years of independence , we started working on wind energy .'
p18737
aS'within a period of last one year we have increased it up to 40 % .'
p18738
aS'so this is the scale of up acceleration .'
p18739
aS'whole world is focussing on solar energy .'
p18740
aS'we have increased it approximately 116 % -118 % .'
p18741
aS'this is not only a substantial incremental change , its a huge leap forward .'
p18742
aS'we intend to enhance the thingsin quantum way .'
p18743
aS'in our country , even before forming of our government , we had the power production .'
p18744
aS'but to reach the power , you need transmission lines and the good transmission infrastructure .'
p18745
aS'two years preceding the formation of our government,30-35 thousand kilometres of transmission lines were being laid annually .'
p18746
aS'today i wish to submit this with satisfaction that we have raised this to 50,000 kilometres .'
p18747
aS'so we have increased the pace here .'
p18748
aS'if we take the commissioning of railway linesin previous 10 years , where commissioning means capacity to ply the trains and to finish all the trials , so earlier it was at the rate of 1500 kilometre in 10 years .'
p18749
aS'but we have made it up to 3500 kilometre in last 2 years .'
p18750
aS'we are to increase this pace even further .'
p18751
aS'brothers and sisters , now we are connecting government schemes to adhaar card , focussing on stopping the leakages through direct benefit transfer .'
p18752
aS'previous government had connected four crore people to government schemes via adhaar card .'
p18753
aS'today i can say this with satisfaction that in place of that work of four crore , we have completed the task of connecting 70 crore people to government schemes via adhaar card .'
p18754
aS'the remaining will also be taken into the fold .'
p18755
aS'today , for middle class or for common people the ownership of a car is a matter of pride .'
p18756
aS'there was a time when gas stove at home was deemed as a standard and as a symbol of social status .'
p18757
aS'during the last 60 years of independence , 14 crore lpg gas connections were given .'
p18758
aS'brothers and sisters , it is a great satisfaction to me that on one side , 14 crore gas connections were given in 60 years , while on the other side , we have given 4 crore gas connections in just 60 weeks .'
p18759
aS'please compare the two figures - 14 crore in 60 years and 4 crore in 60 weeks .'
p18760
aS'this is the speed , by which a change has become possible in the quality of life of common men .'
p18761
aS'we have also started the task of eradicating obsolete laws .'
p18762
aS'the burden of unnecessary laws has been creating hindrance in the functioning of the government , the judiciary and the public .'
p18763
aS'we have identified 1700 such laws , out of which 1175 laws have already been repealed by the parliament and several othersuch laws are in the process of repealing .'
p18764
aS'brothers and sisters , it had become a tendency among the people to say that certain work can be done and certain other work can not be done , certain work can not be done now and certain work can not be done ever .'
p18765
aS'a kind of negativity was prevalent in the minds of people .'
p18766
aS'now , a clear break through is visible in the mindset , a new synergy is seen in the functioning of the government .'
p18767
aS'when an accomplishment is achieved , it stimulates dynamism , which sharpens our determination and then , the end result is not far away .'
p18768
aS"brothers and sisters , when we had launched  prime minister jan-dhan yojana '' , it was almost an impossible task ."
p18769
aS'there were banks and the governments , nationalisation had already taken place , but the common man of the country was not able to be a part of the mainstream of national economy .'
p18770
aS"brothers and sisters , we have attained this impossible task through inclusion of 21 crore persons under  jan-dhan yojana '' ."
p18771
aS'this is not a matter of taking credit by the government , it is really an achievement of 125 crore countrymen of the country , for which i salute them .'
p18772
aS'the campaign for women pride in villages of the country is an important issue of today .'
p18773
aS'the practice of open defecation should be stopped ; toilets should be built in villages .'
p18774
aS'when i had got the first opportunityto address from the ramparts of the red fort , i had expressed my feelings about it .'
p18775
aS'now , i can claim that more than 2 crore toilets have already been built in villages of the country within such a short period .'
p18776
aS'more than 70 thousand villages are now free from the practice of open defecation .'
p18777
aS'we are working towards bringing change in the lives of common man .'
p18778
aS'i had earlier announced from the ramparts of the red fort that we would electrify those 18 thousand villages , which are still without electricity .'
p18779
aS'we are going to complete 70 years of independence , but they had not seen electricity .'
p18780
aS'they were forced to live in the 18th century .'
p18781
aS'we undertook this task of making possible the impossible and today i am glad to say that , though we have not been able to complete even half the task within a thousand days , we are still away from thehalf-mark , out of the 18 thousand , electricity has reached ten thousand villages .'
p18782
aS'i have been told that there are many among those villages who are watching independence day celebrations for the first time today on television in their homes .'
p18783
aS'today , from here i extend special greetings to those villages .'
p18784
aS'brothers and sisters , you will be surprised to know that at merely three hours journey from delhi , there is a village called nagla fatela in hathras region .'
p18785
aS'it takes only three hours to reach this nagla fatela .'
p18786
aS'but it took 70 years for electricity to reach there .'
p18787
aS'70 years , my brothers and sisters !'
p18788
aS'and therefore , i am introducing you to the work culture that we are following .'
p18789
aS'brothers and sisters , the led bulbs were developed by the science and the researchers for welfare of every citizen .'
p18790
aS'but in india it used to cost 350 rupees .'
p18791
aS'who would buy it ?'
p18792
aS'and even the government would think , its alright .'
p18793
aS'the work is done .'
p18794
aS'someone must be using it .'
p18795
aS'but this should not be the attitude .'
p18796
aS'if led bulbs can bring about a change in the life of a common man , if it can ameliorate the environment , if it can improve indias economy , then the government must make effortsin this direction .'
p18797
aS'it is the nature of the government that it intervenes where it is not required and shies away from intervening where it is needed .'
p18798
aS'we tried to change this situation , this work culture .'
p18799
aS'and therefore , the bulb which used to be sold at 350 rupees , it is now being sold at 50 rupees because of governmental intervention .'
p18800
aS'see the difference !'
p18801
aS'350 rupees on one hand and 50 rupees on the other .'
p18802
aS'i do not want to ask where all this money used to go , however , thirteen crorebulbs have been distributed till date .'
p18803
aS'the politics of our country has become populist ; the economic policies have become populist .'
p18804
aS'if three hundred rupees subsidy for each bulb had been given from public exchequer , the prime minister would have been applauded for doling out five hundred crore to the people .'
p18805
aS'but we have ensured that they save thousands of crores by providing bulbs at only fifty rupees .'
p18806
aS'we have already distributed thirteen crore bulbs and we have resolved to distribute 77 crores and i would like to appeal tomy countrymen to use led bulbs in their homes and save 200 , 300 , 500 rupees in a year and save energy and save our environment .'
p18807
aS'the day we achieve the target of 77 crore bulbs , we would be saving 20 thousand mega watt of electricity .'
p18808
aS'when we save 20000 megawatt electricity , it means we save around 125000 crores rupees .'
p18809
aS'brothers and sisters , you can save 125000 crore rupees of the country by using a led bulb at your home .'
p18810
aS'we can fight against global warming by saving 20000megawatt electricity and contribute a lot towards the efforts aimed at the protection of environment and a common man can also contribute to it .'
p18811
aS'so , brothers and sisters , we have worked in that direction-making the impossible possible .'
p18812
aS'you know that we depend on other countries of the world for energy and petroleum products and for that we have signed long term agreements with them so that we could get these products at fixed prices for a long period .'
p18813
aS'we have entered into an agreement with quatar for buying gas till 2024 but the prices are so high that it is costly for our economy .'
p18814
aS'it was a result of our foreign policy relationship that we were able to renegotiate with quatar , and the agreement which was the rightof quatar , and we were bound to buy gas from it till 2024 , we negotiated with them and today , i can say with satisfaction that we made an impossible task possible , they renegotiated their prices and it will save 2000 crore rupees of the exchequer of india .'
p18815
aS'they were entitled to get these 20000 crore rupees but the nature of relationship that we have with them and our policies have made it possible .'
p18816
aS'the negotiations have been going on during the tenure of all the governments and effortswere also made for chabahar port , which is an important link for connecting us with central asia , but today i feel satisfied to see an impossible task becoming possible .'
p18817
aS'when iran , afganistan and india collectively march ahead in a planned way for the construction of chabahar port , an impossible task becomes possible .'
p18818
aS'my brothers and sisters , one thing , i want to talk about and which concerns the common man is inflation .'
p18819
aS'it is true that the inflation rate had crossed 10 % mark during the tenure of previous government .'
p18820
aS'due to our sustained efforts we were able to keep it below 6 percent .'
p18821
aS'not only this , we have , recently , made an agreement with the reserve bank of india that the rbi should take steps to control the inflation at the level of 4 percent with allowance of plus minus 2 .'
p18822
aS'we should leavebehind the talks of balance between inflation and growth and work for moving ahead .'
p18823
aS'but the country witnessed drought during last two years and the effect of drought are readily seen on the prices of vegetables and the outcomes of sluggishness of market have resulted in some problems .'
p18824
aS'the decline in the production of pulses due to drought during last two years was also a cause of concern .'
p18825
aS'but , brothers and sisters , if the inflation would have increased at the same pace as it hadpreviously increased , i dont know how the poor of my country would have survived ?'
p18826
aS'we have tried our best to keep it under check , but still people have lot of expectations from this government and dear countrymen your expectations are natural and i will not leave no stone unturned in achieving them .'
p18827
aS'whatever best i can do , i shall do that and keep the price of poor mans meal under check .'
p18828
aS'my dear brothers and sisters , country is going to celebrate the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji .'
p18829
aS'how can the country forget the saga of sacrifice which has been the tradition of sikh gurus ?'
p18830
aS'today , when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji , i recall one best thought expressed by guruji .'
p18831
aS'guru gobind singhji use to say , how can i consider those hands pure which have not done any service , hands which have not strengthened by labour and have notdeveloped any blisters by toiling hard ?'
p18832
aS'guru gobind singhji use to say this .'
p18833
aS'today , when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji i remember our farmers .'
p18834
aS'whose hands are more pure than theirs ?'
p18835
aS'whose hearts are more pious than their ?'
p18836
aS'whose intentions can be more pure than theirs ?'
p18837
aS'i thanks our farmers that despite two years of drought , they consistently endeavored to fill our granaries , i greet them for this .'
p18838
aS'drought situation has changed and this time we arewitnessing good monsoon .'
p18839
aS'heavy rains have also created problems at some places .'
p18840
aS'government of india stood with those states and citizen who suffered due to heavy rains .'
p18841
aS'today , i specially want to thank our farmers , because , when we are facing shortage of pulses and our farmers have shifted to other crops , and rise in demand of pulses by common man , i have to say this with content that this time our farmers have increased the sowing by one and half times .'
p18842
aS'i want to thank our farmersbecause they have come forward to solve the problem of the crisis of pulses and find its solution .'
p18843
aS'we have decided the msp for pulses and declared a bonus on it .'
p18844
aS'we have streamlined the process of purchase of pulses and promoting the farmers for cultivation of pulses .'
p18845
aS'this will benefit us in a big way .'
p18846
aS'brothers and sisters , when i was talking about work culture , one thing was clear that i do not look at the issues in isolation but as a whole .'
p18847
aS'let us see it as integrated and just take agriculture under integrated things , we have developed such work culture with lot of hard work , the complete chain of which can produce a great result .'
p18848
aS'first of all we focussed upon- the wellness of this soil , wellness of this land , soil health card , macro-nutrition , concern for micro-nutrition and madethe farmers understand that this is lacuna in your soil , these are the good qualities , your soil is good for this crop , this is not suitable for this crop and gradually the farmers started their planning according to this soil health card .'
p18849
aS'the people , who have planned , tell me , sir our expenditure has been reduced up to 25 percent and 30 percent increase is being visible n our production .'
p18850
aS'this number is less at present , but in future as soon as this may pass on , this concept willgain momentum .'
p18851
aS'the farmers have land and if they get water , then the farmer of my country has the power to produce gold out of the soil .'
p18852
aS'the famer of my country has this power and that is why we have emphasized upon water-management , emphasized upon water-irrigation , emphasized upon water-conservation .'
p18853
aS'we are emphasizing upon how every drop of water may be utilised by the farmer , how to increase the importance of water , and get per drop more crop , micro irrigation .'
p18854
aS'more than 90percent irrigation projects were lying incomplete and stalled .'
p18855
aS'we have taken up the responsibility to complete those projects first of all and will work in the direction that lakh of hectares of land may get the benefit of irrigation .'
p18856
aS'we have taken a big leap towards solar pump so that the input cost of the farmers may be lessened because nowadays the farmers require electricity also , they require water , they need electricity , and electricity costs dearer .'
p18857
aS'on account of it , theinput cost of the farmer is going to be less , the recurring expenditure is going to be less and due to owning solar pump at home will result in owning electricity , owning the sun , owning the field , owing the barn and thus our farmer would be happy .'
p18858
aS'we have succeeded in distributing 77 thousands solar pumps till now .'
p18859
aS'brothers and sisters , i would like to congratulate the scientists of our country .'
p18860
aS'good quality seeds are also required along with soil , water and solar pumps .'
p18861
aS'the scientists of our country have developed more than 131 new farmable seeds compatible to the climate and nature of india , which have the capacity to enhance our per hectare production .'
p18862
aS'the values they retain are also being increased .'
p18863
aS'i heartly congratulate these scientists also .'
p18864
aS'the farmers require urea as well asfertilisers .'
p18865
aS'there was time when black marketing was in practice to get the fertilisers , there was time when the police had to lathi-charge for fertilisers .'
p18866
aS'there was time when the farmer used to watch his crop being damaged in the absence of fertilisers before his very eyes .'
p18867
aS'brothers and sisters , the lack of fertilisers has become a matter of past , it has become history now .'
p18868
aS'today , we have succeeded in utmost production of fertiliser by overcoming the shortage of thefertiliser .'
p18869
aS'brothers and sisters , because of this production , the fertilizers are now available to the farmers in time as per their needs .'
p18870
aS'similarly , we conceptualized pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana .'
p18871
aS'its insurance cover includes maximum protection to farmers land and his agro-produce at a comparatively much lower premium , and that too with a guaranteed cover .'
p18872
aS'we have constructed new warehouses to preserve 15 lakhs tons of food grains .'
p18873
aS'our countrys farmers will benefit only when we movetowards value addition , and for this we have laid special emphasis on food processing for the first time .'
p18874
aS'we have encouraged cent percent foreign direct investment which would augment agro-based industries , and consequentially , my brothers and sisters , i believe it would help me and our farmers realize our dream of doubling latters income by 2022 .'
p18875
aS'these efforts would make it possible and for realizing the same , we have taken steps one after another .'
p18876
aS'brothers and sisters , our country has a fancy for a trend .'
p18877
aS'and the governments , with an aim to leave an impression , have done a lot , and to fill the bill in this country , people go for some populist things and empty the exchequer .'
p18878
aS'governments have a trend of establishing an identity .'
p18879
aS'brothers and sisters , i have tried my best to stay away from this allurement , and while doing so , i have tried to do several things in every range with the mantra of total transformation , transformationwith transparency , reform , perform and transform .'
p18880
aS'brothers and sisters , we are far more committed to build the image of hindustan than that of our government .'
p18881
aS'regardless of partys identity , the countrys identity holds primacy .'
p18882
aS'for , if the country moves on , it will yield dividends for the coming generations , for centuries , and exactly , for this reason , we have accorded primacy to the countrys identity and not to our party .'
p18883
aS'now a days , you must have observed the scope of our work in railways .'
p18884
aS'while we are talking about havingbio-toilets in train , we also cherish the dream of bullet train .'
p18885
aS'while we talk about soil health card for farmers , we also want to march ahead in the direction of satellite and space technology .'
p18886
aS'while talking about stand-up india , we are also taking steps towards start-up india .'
p18887
aS'we are laying emphasis on substance than on symbolism .'
p18888
aS'we are stressing on integrated development than on isolated development .'
p18889
aS'leaving aside entitlement , we are focused and emphatic on empowermentbecause an empowering country , my brothers and sisters , provides an identity to the government through the prism of the newly declared schemes .'
p18890
aS'but sometimes the old schemes just tumble down .'
p18891
aS'nevertheless , the govts .'
p18892
aS'is a continuity .'
p18893
aS'if the earlier govts .'
p18894
aS'have done some work ; then it is in the national interest that the next government rectifies their shortcomings and gives a go ahead to these schemes .'
p18895
aS'the arrogance that this was the work of your government and this is mygovt ; hence we would not do this work ; is not in the fitness of the things in a democracy .'
p18896
aS'this is why , with all humility , we have given similar importance to the schemes of the previous governments .'
p18897
aS'this is the hallmark of our work culture as our nation is a continuous and a ceaseless system and we wish to retain that system .'
p18898
aS'this is why , i have a project called progress .'
p18899
aS'under this project , every month , i myself sit and review all the on going projects .'
p18900
aS'you would be amazedto know that almost 119 projects worth rs .'
p18901
aS'seven and a half lakh crores .'
p18902
aS'started by various previous govts .'
p18903
aS'were lying pending .'
p18904
aS'i got all of them going .'
p18905
aS'i said , so much of money have been spent on them , so , all these projects should be completed .'
p18906
aS'now they are all on the way to completion .'
p18907
aS'we created a project monitoring group .'
p18908
aS'i asked them to look into all such projects and find out as to when were they started .'
p18909
aS'i came to know that some of them were started 20 years ago , theother were started somewhere between twenty five to thirty to fifteen years earlier .'
p18910
aS'the people living in the areas of these projects know all .'
p18911
aS'we identified such two hundred and seventy projects worth rs .'
p18912
aS'10 lakhs crores which were inaugurated by some earlier govts .'
p18913
aS'and some crores of rupees were spent on all of them ; but all that money was going down the drain .'
p18914
aS'we started all such stuck up projects once again .'
p18915
aS'brothers and sisters , such helding up and delaying of the schemes afterhaving spent crores of rupees on them is a criminal negligence and we have tried to tide over such things .'
p18916
aS'brothers and sisters , earlier railway projects took at least two years in getting sanctions .'
p18917
aS'a train is passing from somewhere , road have also been made on the both side ; a rail over bridge is to be constructed .'
p18918
aS'but the approval took two years .'
p18919
aS'we have speeded up the approval process and have been able to shorten the approval time to three or four months , or maximum to six months .'
p18920
aS'brothers and sisters , however fast we may work , whatsoever may be the number of the schemes started by us ; the touchstone of good administration of any government lies in the last man delivery or the benefits accrued to that person .'
p18921
aS'so , this has to be taken care off .'
p18922
aS'brothers and sisters , when policies are clear , intentions are clear ; then the sentiments behind the decisions are also a class part and the decisions can be taken unhesitantly .'
p18923
aS'so , due to the correct policies and thecorrect intentions our government is taking unhesitant decisions and giving emphasis on the last man delivery .'
p18924
aS'we have seen and if you also go through the newspapers of uttar pradesh , every year there were stories about the outstanding balance of sugar cane farmers .'
p18925
aS'every year , there was news that this is not being done by the sugar mill owners , that was not being done by the state govt , that sugar cane farmers are in distress .'
p18926
aS'thousands of crores of the rupees was outstanding .'
p18927
aS'so , we made schemes in this regard and tired to ensure the last man delivery and also ensured that the amountshould reach to the farmers .'
p18928
aS'brothers and sisters , out of the total old outstanding balance of the thousands of crores of rupees , i would like to inform you with a lot of satisfaction that almost 99.'
p18929
aS'5 % has been settled .'
p18930
aS'it has happened for the first time after many years .'
p18931
aS'i can point out in solace that all the sugarcane which was procured and which came for marketing this time for that almost 95 per cent of farmers have got the price of sugarcane produced and i am sure and ibelieve that the remaining 5 percent of farmers will also be paid in the coming days .'
p18932
aS'brothers & sisters , we have initiated a mission to provide lpg connections to the poor families .'
p18933
aS"we have launched a dynamic mission under  ujjavala '' scheme to get rid of smokes emanating from chulha for my poor mothers ."
p18934
aS'a target has been laid down to provide gas connections to 5 crores poor families within 3 years .'
p18935
aS'efforts are in progress and we have already provided gas connections to around 50 lakhs and that also have been done merely within the last hundred days -you can imagine - that it may be possible to achieve the said target even before three years .'
p18936
aS'we intend to emphasis upon last mile delivery in this mission .'
p18937
aS'post has steadily become irrelevant due to onlining of our post offices , information technology , whatsapp , messages , e-mail .'
p18938
aS'our country is known as the chains of post offices and we have revamped these post offices .'
p18939
aS'post offices are linked with poor and marginalised people .'
p18940
aS'postman is the only representative of the government who is linked with the feelings and affections of the common man .'
p18941
aS'we have never safeguarded the interests of the post man who has always got the affectionsof everyone and the postman always cares for common people .'
p18942
aS'we have taken measures to convert our post office into a payment bank .'
p18943
aS'by setting of these payment banks , a network of banks will be set up across the villages in the country .'
p18944
aS'pepole will get the benefits of jana-dhana account .'
p18945
aS'the funds of manrega for the common man is now being transferred into their respective accounts through aadhar , the cases of corruption are decreasing .'
p18946
aS'everyone will be benefitted through themission of converting the post office into a payment bank .'
p18947
aS'brothers & sisters , psus in our country are merely set up for loss-making units or for turning into sick units slowly and steadily or for disinvestment .'
p18948
aS'this has been the common practice in the past .'
p18949
aS'we have strived to launch a new work-culture .'
p18950
aS'today , i can point out in satisfaction that we have succeeded to turn the operation of so called notorious air india into an operational profit-making undertaking during the last year .'
p18951
aS'it is a fact that which all the telcom companies ofthe world are profit-making units , the bsnl was turning into a heavy loss-making undertaking .'
p18952
aS'we have succeeded in bringing bsnl to operational profit for the first time .'
p18953
aS'nobody believed that the shipping corporation of india could also rake in profit , now it is bringing profit .'
p18954
aS'there was a time when it was apprehended that how would a power factory last for a week .'
p18955
aS'whether we would be able to get coal for them or not .'
p18956
aS'it also used to be reported that power factories have been shut downfor want of coal .'
p18957
aS'now , we have sufficient stock of coal at the threshold of the power factories .'
p18958
aS'it could be used for months by them .'
p18959
aS'dear brothers & sisters , we have achieved it .'
p18960
aS'often , you must have seen that there is huge talk of corruption in our country .'
p18961
aS'i have observed it myself that how corruption has looked the poor people from the lowest strata of the society and how huge amount of money is being wasted .'
p18962
aS'we have linked aadhar card and aadhar number with the government policies .'
p18963
aS'dear brothers & sisters , earlier there was a system under which funds used to be released from public exchequer for widow pension , scholarship , persons with disabilities and minorities and also we used to receive list of beneficiaries .'
p18964
aS'we looked into it deeply and found that even unborn children are also listed in it and getting benefit out of such schemes .'
p18965
aS'these middlemen used to siphon off billions of rupees from it and nobody even took notice of it .'
p18966
aS'but under the aadhar system , we have removed all these middlemen from the list of beneficiaries and directly transferred the amount to the beneficiaries and found that these are millions of such ghost beneficiaries who do not exist at all and used to receive billions of rupees from it .'
p18967
aS'now that has been checked .'
p18968
aS'we saved lot of amount .'
p18969
aS'we decided to find out the needy persons who were excluded from that list so that the amount of money saved from it should invariably be deposited into the accounts of those persons who want to fight for their rights .'
p18970
aS'we have worked in that direction to deliver it to the last man delivery and we have made it to reach it to them .'
p18971
aS'all of us are aware of the coal scam .'
p18972
aS'today there is no accusation on the coal auction .'
p18973
aS'no stigma is attached to it .'
p18974
aS'the states which excavate coal in india , will continuously earn millions of rupees in the near future .'
p18975
aS'there was a time when the auction of spectrum was surrounded by allegations .'
p18976
aS'we auctioned it online and that has filled the coffers of the country , bringing about healthy competition and also fetching benefits for the nation .'
p18977
aS'dear brothers and sisters , today the world is passing through an era of global economy .'
p18978
aS'every country today is inter-connected and inter-dependent .'
p18979
aS'economically , the whole world is somehow inter-connected in one way or other .'
p18980
aS'however much we may progress in our country , well have to keep the global economy , global arena in view ; come up to the global standards , match it also to stay relevant , and contribute , and also lead the global economy when the time comes .'
p18981
aS'therefore , wellhave to be alert all the time .'
p18982
aS'well have to comply with the global standards to make ourselves up to date .'
p18983
aS'recently , you must have seen how the world bank , i .'
p18984
aS'm.'
p18985
aS'f.'
p18986
aS', world economic forum , credit rating agencies and such other agencies in the world have all appreciated the progress of india .'
p18987
aS'the world is constantly watching these things due to the decisions taken one after another by india in respect of legal reforms , improvement in system and changes in approach .'
p18988
aS'we have veryspeedily improved our ranking in ease of doing business ratings .'
p18989
aS'in terms of foreign investment , with regard to foreign direct investment our country happens to be the most favourite destination in the world today .'
p18990
aS'we have left behind even the big economies of the world in matters of growth rate and gdp .'
p18991
aS'dear brothers and sisters , do you know what an u .'
p18992
aS'n.'
p18993
aS'institute has estimated about india for the next two years ?'
p18994
aS'they have estimated that in two years india will come up to the third spot in the economic sphere in place of its present level at number ten .'
p18995
aS'brothers and sisters , logistic support , infrastructure , all these things are taken into account in global standards , comparisons are made with rich countries of the world .'
p18996
aS'brothers and sisters , while making analysis regarding thislogistic support and infrastructure of india , the world economic forum has said that india has reached above 19 ranks as compared to earlier positions and india is moving up and marching ahead rapidly .'
p18997
aS'brothers and sisters , the way we are marching ahead with a dynamic and predictable economy in our country and also in global reference- the recently passed gst law , is also an empowering step towards it and all those parties deserve appreciations for this .'
p18998
aS"brothers and sisters , i had talked about a campaign from the same place-  beti bachao-beti padhao '' ."
p18999
aS'we do not do any work in piecemeal .'
p19000
aS"we have an integrated approach and i still need the cooperation of the society in the initiatives which we have taken in  beti bachao-beti padhao '' ."
p19001
aS'every single parent need to be aware .'
p19002
aS'we should honour the daughters , protect them and give them the benefit of governments schemes .'
p19003
aS"we have covered millions of families under  sukanya samridhi yojna '' whichguarantees benefits for the daughters when she grows up ."
p19004
aS'we given greatest importance to the insurance schemes in which women are benefitted .'
p19005
aS'they are going to reap its benefits .'
p19006
aS"we have  indradhanush tikakaran yojna '' -because if we ensure two things for our mothers and sisters i ."
p19007
aS'e .'
p19008
aS'economic empowerment and empowerment against health problems and we educate them , you can take it as an assurance that if even a single woman is educated in the family , if she is strong physically andindependent economically , she has power to pull the poorest of the poor family out of poverty and therefore we are working with emphasis on empowerment of women , health of women , economic prosperity of women , physical empowerment of women in our fight against poverty .'
p19009
aS"therefore , my brothers and sisters ,  mudra yojna '' - i am happy that more than three and half crore families reaped the benefits of mudrayojna ."
p19010
aS'in it , most of the people who reached to the door of banks were first timers .'
p19011
aS'even out of these almost 80 percent people were from sc/st/obc .'
p19012
aS'out of these too , 80 percent are women who took loans from banks , mudra bank .'
p19013
aS'this is to be considered that how will these womenfolk will contribute in economic development .'
p19014
aS'brothers and sisters !'
p19015
aS'lastweek we decided that our mothers and sisters who have become the participants in the growth story , need leave after child birth .'
p19016
aS'earlier that leave was shorter but now we have increased this to 26 weeks , enabling the new mother to take care of her infant .'
p19017
aS'our weavers and the people working in textile , who make yarn and yarn rolls , used to get rs.'
p19018
aS'100.'
p19019
aS'we have increased that to rs.'
p19020
aS'190 so as to strengthen the hands of my yarn producing mothers and sisters .'
p19021
aS'our mothers , sisters and weaverswho are engaged in silk production will now receive rs.'
p19022
aS'50 more per meter of production .'
p19023
aS'this has also been decided that this rs.'
p19024
aS'50 per meter will not go either to the trader or to the middleman or to the dealer .'
p19025
aS'instead this rs.'
p19026
aS'50 per meter will go via adhaar directly to the account of the weaver who has produced it .'
p19027
aS'this will empower the weavers .'
p19028
aS'we have started schemes with this intention and effect is now visible .'
p19029
aS'my dear countrymen !'
p19030
aS'when we visualize railway and post office then we are able to see the unity of india .'
p19031
aS'more we increase the institutions connecting india , our setup will change and that will enforce the unity of the country .'
p19032
aS'so in the same tune we have started a new market scheme for farmers with the name e-nam .'
p19033
aS'today farmers can sell their produce online in any of the markets of the country .'
p19034
aS'now he is not constrained to compulsively sell his produce in the market which is 10kilometers from his field .'
p19035
aS'neither to sell at low prices which is not remunerative for his hard work .'
p19036
aS'now a uniform sort of market network is establishing throughout the country with e- nam .'
p19037
aS'gst is soon to result in uniform taxation system and a unitary arrangement thus achieved will unite india as well .'
p19038
aS'you will be amazed to know that earlier a zone was to have surplus energy and there were no takers .'
p19039
aS'another zone used to be in dire need of electricity , had to remain in dark andfactories used to be shut .'
p19040
aS'to effect a change in this scenario , we earned a great success with the one nation , one grid , one price .'
p19041
aS'earlier it used to be rs.'
p19042
aS'10 per unit in summers but i went to telangana few days back to find it to be one rupee ten paise per unit instead of that age old rs .'
p19043
aS'10 .'
p19044
aS'this is the result of one-price system , which can connect the whole country .'
p19045
aS'a worker of our county has to change his place of work after every one or two years .'
p19046
aS'but , his amount , deducted under epf , is not transferred .'
p19047
aS'you will be surprised to know that when i took the charge of the government , rs .'
p19048
aS'27,000 crore were lying under epf , which belonged to the workers .'
p19049
aS'workers were not able to claim their amount , as they were ignorant of the relevant process .'
p19050
aS'to solve this problem , we have issued a universal account number to each worker , which would enableeasy transfer of fund to his new place of work .'
p19051
aS'now , the worker would get his amount after retirement and it would no more be lying dormant in a government treasury .'
p19052
aS'we have strengthened various initiatives such as bharat-mala , setu-bharatam , and bharat-net etc .'
p19053
aS'we are working towards connecting the whole country and towards economic development of the country through all these initiatives .'
p19054
aS'brothers and sisters , this year is important due to various reasons .'
p19055
aS'the country is celebrating 1000th birth anniversary of saint sri ramanuja acharyaji .'
p19056
aS'the country is celebrating 150th birth anniversary of shrimad rajchandra ji , the guru of mahatma gandhi .'
p19057
aS'the country is celebrating 350th birth anniversary of guru gobind singh ji .'
p19058
aS'the country is also celebrating centenary birth celebrations of pandit deen dayal upadhyaya ji .'
p19059
aS'while remembering sri ramanuja acharya ji today , i wish to underline his message to the country .'
p19060
aS'he used to say that we should serve all the devotees of the lord , irrespective of their caste and class .'
p19061
aS'he had said that we should never humiliate anyone and should give respect to all , without any discrimination on the basis of age and caste .'
p19062
aS'the issue that was given importance by gandhi , ambedkar , ramanujacharya , lord buddha , our scriptures and by our all spiritual gurus too is the issue of our social unity .'
p19063
aS'if the society disintegrates , the empire straggles , gets divided into the highs and the lows , the touchables and the untouchables , then brothers and sisters , that society can not sustain .'
p19064
aS'there are social evils , centuries old social evils , but if the social evils have become chronic , they need a bit harsh and yet sensitive treatment .'
p19065
aS'the lackadaisical attitude will not solve the social problems and this is the responsibility of 125 crore citizens .'
p19066
aS'the government and the societytogether will have to steer through the social conflicts .'
p19067
aS'brothers and sisters , all of us will have to fight against the social evils .'
p19068
aS'we all will have to rise above social evils in our own behavior .'
p19069
aS'each and every citizen will have to rise above them and then only we can build a strong india .'
p19070
aS'without empowering our society , we can not make india strong .'
p19071
aS'mere economic progress does not guarantee a strong india , the guarantee of a strong india lies in a strong society .'
p19072
aS'and a strongsociety is built at the edifice of social justice .'
p19073
aS'a strong society is built only on the edifice of social justice .'
p19074
aS'therefore , it is our duty to lay emphasis on social justice .'
p19075
aS'whether they be dalits , the downtrodden , the exploited , the deprived , my adivasi brothers , the rural population , the urban population , the literate or the illiterate , the small or the big- the 125 crore of our fellow countrymen constitute our family .'
p19076
aS'we together have to take forward our country and we allhave to work in the same direction .'
p19077
aS'brothers and sisters , today the entire world acknowledges the fact that india is a country of youths .'
p19078
aS'what can not be achieved by a country through its youth power whose 65 percent population , about 800 million people , is below the age of 35 years ?'
p19079
aS'therefore , my brothers and sisters , it is the need of the hour that the youth get opportunity and employment .'
p19080
aS'today we are heading towards the birth centenary of pandit deen dayal upadhyaya .'
p19081
aS'pandit deen dayal upadhyaya spoke of welfare ofthe last human being which was even the view of mahatma gandhi .'
p19082
aS'pandit deen dayal upadhyaya believed in the philosophy of antyodaya .'
p19083
aS'welfare of the poorest and the weakest was the central theme of the political philosophy of pt .'
p19084
aS'deendayal upadhyayji .'
p19085
aS'he used to say that every youth should get education , every youth should be skilled and every youth should get the opportunity to realise his dreams .'
p19086
aS'we have taken many initiatives to realise those dreams of pt .'
p19087
aS'deendayalji and tofulfil the hopes and aspirations of 800 million youths of the country .'
p19088
aS'the way the road network in the country is expanding , the largest number of vehicles are being manufactured in the country , the country is becoming the largest exporter of softwares , more than 50 new mobile factories have been set up in the country , all these things have created opportunities for the youths .'
p19089
aS'if two crore door toilets have been constructed , it has provided employment to someone , cement has beenprocured from somewhere , iron has been purchased from some other person , and the wooden work has been got done from somewhere else .'
p19090
aS'as the scope of work expands , the possibilities of employment generation also increase .'
p19091
aS'today , we have stressed in that direction .'
p19092
aS'similarly , we are working on skill development as a mission so that crores of youth could acquire skills .'
p19093
aS'we have changed a law , though it seems very small , and this law is model shop and establishment act .'
p19094
aS'we have sent an advisory to states to give reasons why the big malls are allowed to open 365 days and upto 12 in the night but a small shopkeeper in the village has to shut his shop after sunset .'
p19095
aS'even a poor should get the opportunity to keep his shop open for 365 days .'
p19096
aS'whyshould our sisters not get the opportunity to work in night ?'
p19097
aS'we have made legal provisions so that our sisters could go to work in night also .'
p19098
aS'there should be arrangements for their safety and other requirements but they must get the opportunity to work .'
p19099
aS'these are the things which increase employment .'
p19100
aS'brothers and sisters , we are working in that direction and we are ready to do it .'
p19101
aS'brothers and sisters , this is the government , we are the persons who dont believe in delaying the things , we know how to fight not how to delay , so unless we deal with the problems head-on , it is not going to happen .'
p19102
aS'today when we are celebrating our freedom in the country , some one among the army jawans , who live and die for the country , would be ready for taking the bullets on the border , someone will be sitting in bunker and some other one would not be fortunate enough tomeet his sister on the occasion of raksha bandhan .'
p19103
aS'how many jawans are working in armed forces ?'
p19104
aS'more than 33000 police personnel have got martyrdom since we got our independence .'
p19105
aS'why should we forget them and how can we ?'
p19106
aS'these are the people due to whom we can live a life of peace and happiness .'
p19107
aS'the issue of one rank one pension was pending for many years .'
p19108
aS'we do not keep the issues pending but we face them .'
p19109
aS'we have fulfilled our promise of one rank one pension and have spreadhappiness in the home of every indian soldier .'
p19110
aS'we did this work .'
p19111
aS'it was the feeling of our countrymen that the files pertaining to netaji subhash babu should be declassified .'
p19112
aS'today , i bow my head and say that without caring for the result we have decided to declassify these files ; a task which was impossible and kept pending since long .'
p19113
aS'we invited netajis family members and shown them the files and this process of declassifying will continue .'
p19114
aS'i requested the other countries of the world to declassify the files held by them and hand them over toindia because indians have full right to know about subhash babu and history of india .'
p19115
aS'we have worked in that direction .'
p19116
aS'bangladesh -- when partition of india took place , a boundary dispute existed since then .'
p19117
aS'a boundary dispute prevailed since the formation of bangladesh .'
p19118
aS'many decades passed .'
p19119
aS'brothers and sisters , all parties have together solved the indo-bangladesh border dispute and we have amended the constitution also .'
p19120
aS'brothers and sisters , a middle class person wants to construct his own house , wants to buy a flat .'
p19121
aS'builders lobby shows him a beautifully printed booklet and the helpless soul falls prey to it .'
p19122
aS'he is not having any technical knowledge , he pays the installments but he is not getting the promised house in time .'
p19123
aS'a middle class makes one house in his whole life and in it he invests all his capital .'
p19124
aS'brothers and sisters , we have put a check by passing the real estate bill , so that a middleclass should not face any problem if he wishes to own a house .'
p19125
aS'we have worked for this .'
p19126
aS'brothers and sisters , i have already said that this year is the 150th anniversary of shrimad rajchandra ji , the guru of mahatma gandhi .'
p19127
aS'when gandhiji was staying at south africa , then also he was having correspondence with shrimad rajchandra ji .'
p19128
aS'in one of his letter shrimad rajchandra ji discussed violence and non-violence .'
p19129
aS'in that letter rajchandra ji writes , when violence came in to existence from same time the principle of non-violence also born .'
p19130
aS'the important thing in both isthat which we prefer or which is being used in the interest of mankind .'
p19131
aS'brothers and sisters , the discussion of violence and non-violence is very inherent in our country .'
p19132
aS'humanity is in our blood .'
p19133
aS'we are the people of a great , colossal culture .'
p19134
aS'this country is full of diversity , colours and beauty .'
p19135
aS'this is such a bouquet of mother india wherein all type of fragrances , all type of colours and all type of dreams exist .'
p19136
aS'brothers and sisters , the unity of diversity is our biggest strength .'
p19137
aS'the mantra of unity is connected to our roots .'
p19138
aS'brothers and sisters , a country having more than hundred languages , hundreds of dialects , innumerable attires , innumerable life styles , despite that this country remained united- its main reason is our cultural heritage .'
p19139
aS'we know how to respect , we know hospitality , we know how to assimilate , we have carried this great tradition and that is why there is no room for violence and atrocity in our country .'
p19140
aS'if the democracy of india is to be strengthened , the dreams of india are to befulfilled then the path of violence would never bring success for us .'
p19141
aS'nowadays a game of killing the innocents is being played on the pretext of maoism in forests , on the pretext of extremism at border , on the pretext of terrorism at hilly areas by carrying guns on shoulders .'
p19142
aS'forty years have passed , this mother soil has grown blood stained but the persons on the path of terrorism have not achieved anything .'
p19143
aS'i would like to remind those youth that this country will nevertolerate violence nor would it ever put up with terrorism .'
p19144
aS'nor would it bow down to terrorism .'
p19145
aS'it will never succumb to maoism .'
p19146
aS'but i exhort them and say that you still have time-return to the mainstream .'
p19147
aS'just think about your parents dream ; just reflect on the hopes and expectations of your parents ; return back to the mainstream ; live a happy and peaceful life , for , the path of violence never fetches benefit to anybody .'
p19148
aS'brothers and sister , we talk about foreign policy .'
p19149
aS'i dont want to go into details .'
p19150
aS'we had invited the leaders of saarc countries on the day we took oath at the centre .'
p19151
aS'our message was clear that we all , neighbouring countries , have a common problem , and that common challenge is poverty .'
p19152
aS'let us fight this poverty together , by fighting one-another , we are left shattered but if we fight this poverty , we will walk towards prosperity .'
p19153
aS'so , i exhort all neighbouring countries to joinus in this fight against poverty .'
p19154
aS'no freedom can be much bigger than the freedom of our citizens from poverty ; freedom of our countrys citizen from poverty .'
p19155
aS'no liberation is more liberating than the freedom from poverty .'
p19156
aS'whenever a citizen from the neighbouring countries would get freedom from poverty , we will feel elated regardless of the fact whether the poor belongs to us or our neighbouring country .'
p19157
aS'brothers and sisters , what kind of people are those who got drive from humanity and , what is the kind of those who reward terrorism ?'
p19158
aS'i want to place two pictures before this world , and i say to the world , i say to those who believe in humanity that just weigh out the attack , when terrorists brutally killed innocent children in a school at peshawar .'
p19159
aS'the attack take place in peshawar , and was a terrorist incident .'
p19160
aS'the innocent children became victim of the bloodbath ; the temple oflearning had blood stream all around ; innocent children were slaughtered .'
p19161
aS'hindustan , the parliament had tears in its eyes ; every indian school was in tears ; every child of india felt the trauma of the deaths of children in peshawar .'
p19162
aS'his tears had become unstoppable .'
p19163
aS'every child , who was killed in peshawar in the terrorist attack , ached our heart too .'
p19164
aS'this is the drive of our nurtured culture of humanity ; this is our humanity , but if you look around , you will find a more toglorify terrorists .'
p19165
aS'where innocent people are killed in terrorist attack , and they celebrate , what type of terrorism inspired life it is , what type of these creations of the terrorism inspired governments are ?'
p19166
aS'the world will understand these two differences properly , this is sufficient for me .'
p19167
aS'today i want to specially honour and thank to some people from the ramparts of red fort .'
p19168
aS'for the past few days the people of baluchistan , the people of gilgit , the people of pakistan occupied kashmir , theway their citizens have heartily thanked me , the way they have acknowledged me , the goodwill they have shown towards me , the people settled far across , the land which i have not seen , the people i have not met ever , but people settled at far across acknowledge the prime minister of india , they honour him , so it is an honour of my 125 crores countrymen , it is respect of my 125 crores countrymen and that is why owing to the feeling of this honour , i want to heartily thank thepeople of baluchistan , the people of gilgit , the people of pakistan occupied kashmir for having an expression of thankfulness .'
p19169
aS'brothers and sisters , today when we are celebrating the seventy years of independence , then there is a big contribution of freedom soldiers for the country .'
p19170
aS'when there is a contribution of these freedom soldiers , then the government is deciding to increase 20 percent in the honouring amount being received , pension being received by the all these honourable freedom soldiers family members .'
p19171
aS'the freedom fighters who earlier used to get 25000 rupees , will now get 30000 rupees .'
p19172
aS'it is mysmall effort to pay my respects to the sacrifice and oblation of our freedom fighters .'
p19173
aS'brothers and sisters , when we talk about the history of freedom struggle of our country , some persons are talked about a lot , some are excessively mentioned but the contribution made by the people living in jungles , the tribals , in the freedom struggle was unmatched .'
p19174
aS'they used to live in jungles .'
p19175
aS'we hear the name of birsa munda but perhaps there would be no tribal dominated district where the tribals would not have fought and given sacrifice since 1857 to the time we got freedom .'
p19176
aS'theyproved through their sacrifice what is freedom , what is struggle against servitude .'
p19177
aS'but our forthcoming generations are not much aware of this history .'
p19178
aS'the government desires and plans that in the coming days , in the states where these freedom fighters , who were tribals , who lived in jungles , fought against britishers , who were not ready to succumb .'
p19179
aS'the government would work towards building permanent museums in various states dedicated to tribal brave freedom fighters , whereverland would be available for the purpose , where their contributions and memoirs would be displayed , so that coming generations could be able to know about their sacrifices for the country .'
p19180
aS'brothers and sisters , in the midst of the debate on inflation , we are realising one fact that the entire economy of a poor household is affected if somebody falls ill .'
p19181
aS'the wedding of their daughters gets stalled , the education of children gets stalled and sometimes even food is not available in the evening .'
p19182
aS'healthcare is getting costlier and that is why , i am announcing an important scheme from the ramparts of the red fort for the healthcare of bpl families .'
p19183
aS'government arefaking an important for such families .'
p19184
aS'under this scheme , in the coming days , if such poor families have to take medical facilities , the government will bear expenditure upto rs.'
p19185
aS'1 lakh per year , so that my poor brothers are not deprived of healthcare facilities and their dreams are not shattered .'
p19186
aS'my dear brothers and sisters , let us proceed forward with a new determination , new energy , new enthusiasm by getting inspiration from those great persons who scarified their lives for our freedom .'
p19187
aS'we did not get an opportunity to die for the country but we have the opportunity to live for the country .'
p19188
aS'we should dedicate our life to the nation .'
p19189
aS'we should achieve something of substance for the nation .'
p19190
aS'we should fulfill our responsibilities and also inspire others to accomplishtheir responsibilities .'
p19191
aS'we should stride forward for building of one society , one dream , one resolution , one direction and one destination .'
p19192
aS'with this very pious feeling , i once again bow my head before the great personalities of the country , the soldiers who risk their lives for our security on water , land and air fields and also those 33 thousands martyrs who sacrificed their lives for us .'
p19193
aS'so , i , hereby , dedicate myself to dream about the future of the country and call on all of you fromthe rampart of the red fort to speak with your full might : bharat mata ki jay !'

aS'president mohammad ashraf ghani foreign minister excellency rabbani and my dear afghan friends , sisters and brothers it is indeed a matter of great pleasure to be with you again .'
p19209
aS'afghanistan is indias immediate neighbor and , in our hearts and minds , indians and afghans have always been closest of friends .'
p19210
aS'today , we once again come together to celebrate yet another achievement of our friendship and , take another step in the fruitful journey of our cooperation .'
p19211
aS'excellency ghani , fewer things give greater joy than getting together with good friends to celebrate successful completion of joint initiatives .'
p19212
aS'you and i have been fortunate to have done so on important occasions in the past months .'
p19213
aS'in december last year , you and the afghan people stood with me to inaugurate the afghan parliament .'
p19214
aS'the inauguration signaled and showed our joint commitment to strengthening the foundations of modern afghanistan .'
p19215
aS'the india-afghanistan-iran transit corridor agreement that we signed in may this year was another land mark in our partnership .'
p19216
aS'it manifested our clear and common determination to build new pathways for afghanistans economic progress and prosperity and , a month later , in june this year , we joined hands and inaugurated the afghanistan-india friendship dam .'
p19217
aS'the salma dam will revive and renew not just the economy and agriculture of the herat region of afghanistan .'
p19218
aS'but will also build a strong and lasting pillar of support for afghanistans overall growth and development .'
p19219
aS'excellency , todays video inauguration of stor palace is an entirely different , yet in many ways more fundamental , dimension of our engagement .'
p19220
aS'i say this because it brings back to life a valuable landmark of afghanistans cultural heritage .'
p19221
aS'the stor palace has been the setting for many momentous historical events .'
p19222
aS'to those who can not see beyond shadows of violence in afghanistan , the restored stor palace is a reminder of the glory of afghanistans rich traditions .'
p19223
aS'and for our afghan brothers and sisters , it revives the beauty , the richness and splendor of lost memories of afghan society .'
p19224
aS'true to the foundations of our ties , it links the present of our friendship to the historical bonds of our linkages .'
p19225
aS'i must commend all the artists , experts and consultants who worked day and night to accomplish this delicate task .'
p19226
aS'friends , afghanistan is a close friend .'
p19227
aS'our societies and people have had age old ties and links .'
p19228
aS'it , therefore , saddens us to see that your proud nation continues to be challenged by externally sponsored instruments and entities of violence and terror .'
p19229
aS'let me assure the people of afghanistan that in your quest : - to build a prosperous afghanistan ; and- to bring peace , security and stability to your society ; the 1.'
p19230
aS'25 billion people of india will always be on your side .'
p19231
aS'the pledge of our partnership and strength of our friendship with afghanistan is unwavering .'
p19232
aS'todays event is a testimony to the resolve and range of our cooperative endeavours .'
p19233
aS'we want each afghan to flourish and your society to be benefited from fruits of economic growth .'
p19234
aS'whatever may be the odds , india will work with you for a bright future for all afghans .'
p19235
aS'excellency , in the end , i would like to take this opportunity to thank you and your government for protecting indian embassy and consulates and ensuring the safety and security of indian experts working in afghanistan .'
p19236
aS'the sacrifices made by our afghan brothers will not be forgotten .'
p19237
aS'i once again thank you for your presence today .'
p19238
aS'i look forward to seeing you in person soon .'
p19239
aS'i also hope to have an opportunity to visit the renovated stor palace someday .'
p19240
aS'thank you , thank you very much .'
p19241
aa(lp19242
S'there was a time when development was believed to depend on the quantity of capital and labour .'
p19243
aS'today we know that it depends as much on the quality of institutions and ideas .'
p19244
aS'early last year , a new institution was created , namely , the national institution for transforming india or niti .'
p19245
aS'niti was created as an evidence based think tank to guide indias transformation .'
p19246
aS'one of nitis functions is : - to mainstream external ideas into government policies , through collaboration with national and international experts ; - to be the governments link to the outside world , outside experts and practitioners ; - to be the instrument through which ideas from outside are incorporated into policy-making .'
p19247
aS'the government of india and the state governments have a long administrative tradition .'
p19248
aS'this tradition combines indigenous and external ideas from indias past .'
p19249
aS'this administrative tradition has served india well in many ways .'
p19250
aS'above all , it has preserved democracy and federalism , unity and integrity , in a country of glorious diversity .'
p19251
aS'these are not small achievements .'
p19252
aS'yet , we now live in an age where change is constant and we are variables .'
p19253
aS'we must change for both external and internal reasons .'
p19254
aS'each country has its own experiences , its own resources and its own strengths .'
p19255
aS'thirty years ago , a country might have been able to look inward and find its own solutions .'
p19256
aS'today , countries are inter dependent and inter connected .'
p19257
aS'no country can afford any longer to develop in isolation .'
p19258
aS'every country has to benchmark its activities to global standards , or else fall behind .'
p19259
aS'change is also necessary for internal reasons .'
p19260
aS'the younger generation in our own country is thinking and aspiring so differently , that government can no longer afford to remain rooted in the past .'
p19261
aS'even in families , the relationship between the young and old has changed .'
p19262
aS'there was a time when elders in a family knew more than those who were younger .'
p19263
aS'today , with the spread of new technology , the situation is often reversed .'
p19264
aS'this increases the challenge for government in communicating and in meeting rising expectations .'
p19265
aS'if india is to meet the challenge of change , mere incremental progress is not enough .'
p19266
aS'a metamorphosis is needed .'
p19267
aS'that is why my vision for india is rapid transformation , not gradual evolution.'
p19268
aS'- the transformation of india can not happen without a transformation of governance.'
p19269
aS'- a transformation of governance can not happen without a transformation in mindset.'
p19270
aS'- a transformation in mindset can not happen without transformative ideas .'
p19271
aS'we have to change laws , eliminate unnecessary procedures , speed up processes and adopt technology .'
p19272
aS'we can not march through the twenty first century with the administrative systems of the nineteenth century .'
p19273
aS'fundamental changes in administrative mindsets usually occur through sudden shocks or crisis .'
p19274
aS'india is fortunate to be a stable democratic polity .'
p19275
aS'in the absence of such shocks , we have to make special efforts to force ourselves to make transformative changes .'
p19276
aS'as individuals , we may absorb new ideas by reading books or articles .'
p19277
aS'books open the windows of our minds .'
p19278
aS'however , unless we brainstorm collectively , ideas remain confined to individual minds .'
p19279
aS'we often hear of new ideas and understand them .'
p19280
aS'but we do not act upon them , because it is beyond our individual capacity .'
p19281
aS'if we sit together , we will have the collective force to convert ideas into action .'
p19282
aS'what we need is a collective opening of our minds , to let in new , global perspectives .'
p19283
aS'to do this , we have to absorb new ideas collectively rather than individually .'
p19284
aS'it requires a concerted effort .'
p19285
aS'as many of you know , ever since taking office , i have personally participated in structured brainstorming sessions with bankers , with police officers and with secretaries to government , among others .'
p19286
aS'the ideas coming from those sessions are being incorporated into policy .'
p19287
aS'these efforts have been to tap ideas from inside .'
p19288
aS'the next step is to bring in ideas from outside .'
p19289
aS'culturally , indians have always been receptive to ideas from elsewhere .'
p19290
aS'it is said in the rigveda , which means , let us welcome noble thoughts flowing in from all directions .'
p19291
aS'this is the purpose of the transforming india lecture series .'
p19292
aS'it is a series which we will attend , not as individuals but as part of a team who can collectively make change happen .'
p19293
aS'we will draw the best from the wisdom and knowledge of eminent persons , who changed , or influenced change in the lives of many , to make their nation a better place in the planet .'
p19294
aS'this lecture will be the first in a series .'
p19295
aS'you have all been given a feedback form .'
p19296
aS'i look forward to your detailed and frank feedback to help us improve this process .'
p19297
aS'i request you to suggest names of experts and panelists from inside and outside india .'
p19298
aS'i also request all secretaries to government to conduct a follow up discussion in a weeks time , with the participants from their ministries .'
p19299
aS'the purpose is to convert ideas that emerge in todays session into specific actionpoints relevant to each group .'
p19300
aS'wherever possible , i request the ministers also to participate in these sessions .'
p19301
aS'one of the greatest reformers and administrators of our time was lee kuan yew , who transformed singapore to what it is today .'
p19302
aS'it is therefore fitting that we are inaugurating this series with shri tharman shanmugaratnam , deputy prime minister of singapore .'
p19303
aS'he is a prolific scholar and public policy maker .'
p19304
aS'apart from being deputy prime minister , he is also the coordinating minister for economic and social policies , minister of finance and chairman of monetary authority ofsingapore .'
p19305
aS'in the past , he has served as the minister of manpower , second minister of finance and minister of education .'
p19306
aS'shri shanmugaratnam was born in nineteen fifty seven and is of sri lankan tamil ancestry .'
p19307
aS'he earned his bachelors degree in economics at the london school of economics .'
p19308
aS'he has a masters degree in economics from cambridge university .'
p19309
aS'he has another masters degree in public administration from harvard university .'
p19310
aS'at harvard , he was honoured with the littauer fellow award for his outstanding performance .'
p19311
aS'shri shanmugaratnam is one of the worlds leading intellectuals .'
p19312
aS'i would like to give you an example of the range and sweep of his ideas .'
p19313
aS'today , singapores economy depends a lot on transshipment .'
p19314
aS'but if global warming melts the polar ice caps , new navigation routes may open and possibly reduce singapores relevance .'
p19315
aS'i am told he has already started thinking about this possibility and planning for it .'
p19316
aS'friends .'
p19317
aS'the list of achievements and honours received by shri shanmugaratnam is long .'
p19318
aS'but we are all eager to listen to him .'
p19319
aS'therefore , without further delay , it is with great pleasure that i welcome shri tharman shanmugaratnam to this stage and request him to enlighten us on the subject of india in the global economy .'
